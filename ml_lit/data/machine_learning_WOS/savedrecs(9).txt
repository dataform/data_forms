In previous studies, water movement through the soil has been simulated mainly using physically-based models. The most frequently used models for predicting soil water movement are MACRO, HYDRUS-1D/2D and Root Zone Water Quality Model. However, these models are difficult to apply to a small portion of land due to the information required about the soil and climate, which are difficult to obtain for each plot separately. In this paper, we focus on improving the performance and applicability of water outflow modeling by using a modeling approach based on machine learning techniques. It allows us to overcome the major drawbacks of physically-based models e.g., the complexity and difficulty of obtaining the information necessary for the calibration and the validation, by learning models from data collected from experimental fields that are representative for a wider area (region). We evaluate the proposed approach on data obtained from the La Jailliere experimental site, located in Western France. This experimental site represents one of the ten scenarios contained in the MACRO system. Our study focuses on two types of water outflows: discharge through sub-surface drainage systems and surface runoff. The results show that the proposed modeling approach successfully extracts knowledge from the collected data, avoiding the need to provide the information for calibration and validation of physically-based models. In addition, we compare the overall performance of the learned models with the performance of existing models MACRO and RZWQM. The comparison shows overall improvement in the prediction of discharge through sub-surface drainage systems, and partial improvement in the prediction of the surface runoff, in years with intensive rainfall.

A general procedure to generate models for urban environmental noise pollution using feature selection and machine learning methods	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Feature selection; Multiple linear regression; Multilayer perceptron; Sequential minimal optimisation; Gaussian processes for regression; Environmental-noise prediction	GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; TRAFFIC-NOISE; SOUND ENVIRONMENTS; PREDICTION METHOD; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SVM REGRESSION; AIR-POLLUTION; ROAD; ALGORITHMS	The prediction of environmental noise in urban environments requires the solution of a complex and non-linear problem, since there are complex relationships among the multitude of variables involved in the characterization and modelling of environmental-noise and environmental-noise magnitudes. Moreover, the inclusion of the great spatial heterogeneity characteristic of urban environments seems to be essential in order to achieve an accurate environmental-noise prediction in cities. This problem is addressed in this paper, where a procedure based on feature-selection techniques and machine-learning regression methods is proposed and applied to this environmental problem. Three machine-learning regression methods, which are considered very robust in solving nonlinear problems, are used to estimate the energy-equivalent sound-pressure level descriptor (L-Aeq). These three methods are: (i) multilayer perceptron (MLP), (ii) sequential minimal optimisation (SMO), and (iii) Gaussian processes for regression (GPR). In addition, because of the high number of input variables involved in environmental-noise modelling and estimation in urban environments, which make L-Aeq prediction models quite complex and costly in terms of time and resources for application to real situations, three different techniques are used to approach feature selection or data reduction. The feature-selection techniques used are: (i) correlation-based feature-subset selection (CFS), (ii) wrapper for feature-subset selection (WFS), and the data reduction technique is principal-component analysis (PCA). The subsequent analysis leads to a proposal of different schemes, depending on the needs regarding data collection and accuracy. The use of WFS as the feature-selection technique with the implementation of SMO or GPR as regression algorithm provides the best L-Aeq estimation (R-2 = 0.94 and mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.14-1.16 dB(A)).

Trajectory data in a database are intrinsically heterogeneous, as they represent discrete approximations of original continuous paths derived using different sampling strategies and different sampling rates. Such heterogeneity can have a negative impact on the effectiveness of trajectory similarity measures, which are the basis of many crucial trajectory processing tasks. In this paper, we pioneer a systematic approach to trajectory calibration that is a process to transform a heterogeneous trajectory dataset to one with (almost) unified sampling strategies. Specifically, we propose an anchor-based calibration system that aligns trajectories to a set of anchor points, which are fixed locations independent of trajectory data. After examining four different types of anchor points for the purpose of building a stable reference system, we propose a spatial-only geometry-based calibration approach that considers the spatial relationship between anchor points and trajectories. Then a more advanced spatial-only model-based calibration method is presented, which exploits the power of machine learning techniques to train inference models from historical trajectory data to improve calibration effectiveness. Afterward, since trajectory has temporal information, we extend these two spatial-only trajectory calibration algorithms to incorporate the temporal information, which can infer a proper time stamp to each anchor point of a calibrated trajectory. At last, we provide a solution to reduce cost, i.e., the number of trajectories that is necessary to be re-calibrated, of the updating of the reference system. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real trajectory datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed calibration system.

Frequency and Implications of Discordant Gene Expression Profile Class in Posterior Uveal Melanomas Sampled by Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; CANCER; LEUKEMIA; HETEROGENEITY; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; TUMORS; ASSAY	PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of discordant gene expression profile (GEP) classification of posterior uveal melanomas sampled at 2 tumor sites by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). DESIGN: Prospective single-institution longitudinal study performed in conjunction with a multicenter validation study of the prognostic value of GEP class of posterior uveal melanoma cells for metastasis and metastatic death. METHODS: FNAB aspirates of 80 clinically diagnosed primary choroidal and ciliochoroidal melanomas were obtained from 2 tumor sites prior to or at the time of initial ocular tumor treatment and submitted for independent GEP testing and classification. Frequency of discordant GEP classification of these specimens was determined. RESULTS: Using the support vector machine learning algorithm favored by the developer of the GEP test employed in this study, 9 of the 80 cases (11.3% [95% confidence interval: 9.0%-13.6%]) were clearly discordant. If cases with a failed classification at 1 site or a low confidence class assignment by the support vector machine algorithm at 1 or both sites are also regarded as discordant, then this frequency rises to 13 of the 80 cases (16.3% [95% confidence interval: 13.0%-19.6%]). CONCLUSION: Sampling of a clinically diagnosed posterior uveal melanoma at a single site for prognostic GEP testing is associated with a substantial probability of misclassification. Two-site sampling of such tumors with independent GEP testing of each specimen may be advisable to lessen the probability of underestimating an individual patient's prognostic risk of metastasis and metastatic death.

Integrating representation learning and skill learning in a human-like intelligent agent	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Agent learning; Representation learning; Student modeling	EXPERT MEMORY; NETWORKS; MODEL; RECOGNITION; ACQUISITION; ALGORITHM	Building an intelligent agent that simulates human learning of math and science could potentially benefit both cognitive science, by contributing to the understanding of human learning, and artificial intelligence, by advancing the goal of creating humanlevel intelligence. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge; in addition to being a poor model of human acquisition of prior knowledge, manual knowledge-encoding is both time-consuming and error-prone. Previous research has shown that one of the key factors that differentiates experts and novices is their different representations of knowledge. Experts view the world in terms of deep functional features, while novices view it in terms of shallow perceptual features. Moreover, since the performance of learning algorithms is sensitive to representation, the deep features are also important in achieving effective machine learning. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in the form of "deep features", and demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain of algebra as well as synthetic domains. We integrate this algorithm into a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, which learns procedural knowledge by observing a tutor solve sample problems, and by getting feedback while actively solving problems on its own. We show that learning "deep features" reduces the requirements for knowledge engineering. Moreover, we propose an approach that automatically discovers student models using the extended SimStudent. By fitting the discovered model to real student learning curve data, we show that it is a better student model than human-generated models, and demonstrate how the discovered model may be used to improve a tutoring system's instructional strategy.

J	Baranauskas, JA				Baranauskas, Jose Augusto			The number of classes as a source for instability of decision tree algorithms in high dimensional datasets	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Decision tree; Number of classes; Number of splits	INDUCTION	For a long time, experimental studies have been performed in a large number of fields of AI, specially in machine learning. A careful evaluation of a specific machine learning algorithm is important, but often difficult to conduct in practice. On the other hand, simulation studies can provide insights on behavior and performance aspects of machine learning approaches much more readily than using real-world datasets, where the target concept is normally unknown. Under decision tree induction algorithms an interesting source of instability that sometimes is neglected by researchers is the number of classes in the training set. This paper uses simulation to extended a previous work performed by Leo Breiman about properties of splitting criteria. Our simulation results have showed the number of best-splits grows according to the number of classes: exponentially, for both entropy and twoing criteria and linearly, for gini criterion. Since more splits imply more alternative choices, decreasing the number of classes in high dimensional datasets (ranging from hundreds to thousands of attributes, typically found in biomedical domains) can help lowering instability of decision trees. Another important contribution of this work concerns the fact that for 5 classes balanced datasets are prone to provide more best-splits (thus increasing instability) than imbalanced ones, including binary problems often addressable in machine learning; on the other hand, for five or more classes balanced datasets can provide few best-splits.

A method to quantify mitochondrial morphology and function is presented here using a commercially available automated high-content wide-field fluorescent microscopy platform and R programming-language-based semi-automated data analysis to achieve high throughput morphological categorization (puncta, rod, network, and large & round) and quantification of mitochondrial membrane potential. In conjunction with cellular respirometry to measure mitochondrial respiratory capacity, this method detected that increasing concentrations of toxicants known to directly or indirectly affect mitochondria (t-butyl hydroperoxide [TBHP], rotenone, antimycin A, oligomycin, ouabain, and carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone [FCCP]), decreased mitochondrial networked areas in cultured 661w cells to 0.60-0.80 at concentrations that inhibited respiratory capacity to 020-0.70 (fold change compared to vehicle). Concomitantly, mitochondrial swelling was increased from 1.4- to 2.3-fold of vehicle as indicated by changes in large 82 round areas in response to TBHP, oligomycin, or ouabain. Finally, the automated identification of mitochondrial location enabled accurate quantification of mitochondrial membrane potential by measuring intramitochondrial tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) fluorescence intensity. Administration of FCCP depolarized and administration of oligomycin hyperpolarized mitochondria, as evidenced by changes in intramitochondrial TMRM fluorescence intensities to 0.33- or 525-fold of vehicle control values, respectively. In summary, this high-content imaging method accurately quantified mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential in hundreds of thousands of cells on a per-cell basis, with sufficient throughput for pharmacological or toxicological evaluation.

Multivariate Decoding of Cerebral Blood Flow Measures in a Clinical Model of On-Going Postsurgical Pain	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						pain; biomarker; arterial spin labeling; machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; LOW-BACK-PAIN; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; PERFUSION FMRI; MRI DATA; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; BIOMARKERS; EXPERIENCE	Recent reports of multivariate machine learning (ML) techniques have highlighted their potential use to detect prognostic and diagnostic markers of pain. However, applications to date have focussed on acute experimental nociceptive stimuli rather than clinically relevant pain states. These reports have coincided with others describing the application of arterial spin labeling (ASL) to detect changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with on-going clinical pain. We combined these acquisition and analysis methodologies in a well-characterized postsurgical pain model. The principal aims were (1) to assess the classification accuracy of rCBF indices acquired prior to and following surgical intervention and (2) to optimise the amount of data required to maintain accurate classification. Twenty male volunteers, requiring bilateral, lower jaw third molar extraction (TME), underwent ASL examination prior to and following individual left and right TME, representing presurgical and postsurgical states, respectively. Six ASL time points were acquired at each exam. Each ASL image was preceded by visual analogue scale assessments of alertness and subjective pain experiences. Using all data from all sessions, an independent Gaussian Process binary classifier successfully discriminated postsurgical from presurgical states with 94.73% accuracy; over 80% accuracy could be achieved using half of the data (equivalent to 15 min scan time). This work demonstrates the concept and feasibility of time-efficient, probabilistic prediction of clinically relevant pain at the individual level. We discuss the potential of ML techniques to impact on the search for novel approaches to diagnosis, management, and treatment to complement conventional patient self-reporting.

Using Random Forests to distinguish gahnite compositions as an exploration guide to Broken Hill-type Pb-Zn-Ag deposits in the Broken Hill domain, Australia	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION			English	Article						Random Forests; Gahnite; Broken Hill; Statistics; Exploration	SULFIDE-SILICATE EQUILIBRIA; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION-ANALYSIS; MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS; METAMORPHOSED ORE-DEPOSITS; RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS; GARNET-RICH ROCKS; BASE-METAL; MINERAL EXPLORATION; TRACE-ELEMENTS	Various studies have focused on evaluating variability in the major-trace element chemistry of minerals as exploration guides to metallic mineral deposits or diamond-bearing kimberlites. The chemistry of gahnite has previously been proposed as an exploration guide to Broken Hill-type Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization in the Broken Hill domain, Australia, with the development of a series of discrimination plots to compare the composition of gahnite from the supergiant Broken Hill deposit with those in occurrences of minor Broken Hill-type mineralization. Here, the performance of Random Forests, a relatively new statistical technique, is used to classify mineral chemistry using a database (n = 533) of gahnite compositions (i.e., Mg, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, and Cd) from the Broken Hill deposit and 11 minor Broken Hill-type deposits in the Broken Hill domain. This statistical method has yet to be applied to geological problems involving mineral chemistry. Random Forests provide a framework for classification and decision making through a series of classification trees, which individually, resemble classification keys. Gahnite from the Broken Hill domain is classified here on the basis of the following schemes: 1. Random Forest 1 (RF1): gahnite in the Broken Hill deposit versus compositions of gahnite from other minor Broken Hill-type occurrences in the Broken Hill domain; 2. Random Forest 2 (RF2): gahnite in the Broken Hill deposit versus gahnite in minor Broken Hill-type deposits containing > 0.25 million tonnes (Mt) of Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization versus gahnite in sulfide-free and sulfide-poor prospects containing <0.25 Mt; and 3. Random Forest 3 (RF3): gahnite in sulfide-bearing quartz-gahnite lode rocks versus gahnite in sulfide-free samples. Misclassification rates, according to a ten-fold cross validation, of RF1, RF2, and RF3 are 1.6, 3.3, and 4.7% respectively. Results of this study suggest that Random Forests work well in classification problems involving mineral chemistry, and may prove useful in the exploration for Broken Hill-type and other types of metallic mineral deposits.

However, treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index (the hip-index). Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.

J	Cruz-Barbosa, R; Vellido, A; Giraldo, J				Cruz-Barbosa, Raul; Vellido, Alfredo; Giraldo, Jesus			The influence of alignment-free sequence representations on the semi-supervised classification of class C G protein-coupled receptors	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Class C G protein-coupled receptors; Semi-supervised learning; Alignment-free sequence representations	PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; DRUG TARGETS; PHARMACOLOGY; INFORMATION	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral cell membrane proteins of relevance for pharmacology. The tertiary structure of the transmembrane domain, a gate to the study of protein functionality, is unknown for almost all members of class C GPCRs, which are the target of the current study. As a result, their investigation must often rely on alignments of their amino acid sequences. Sequence alignment entails the risk of missing relevant information. Various approaches have attempted to circumvent this risk through alignment-free transformations of the sequences on the basis of different amino acid physicochemical properties. In this paper, we use several of these alignment-free methods, as well as a basic amino acid composition representation, to transform the available sequences. Novel semi-supervised statistical machine learning methods are then used to discriminate the different class C GPCRs types from the transformed data. This approach is relevant due to the existence of orphan proteins to which type labels should be assigned in a process of deorphanization or reverse pharmacology. The reported experiments show that the proposed techniques provide accurate classification even in settings of extreme class-label scarcity and that fair accuracy can be achieved even with very simple transformation strategies that ignore the sequence ordering.

J	Rehbaum, H; Farina, D				Rehbaum, Hubertus; Farina, Dario			Adaptive common average filtering for myocontrol applications	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						EMG; Signal processing; Noise reduction; Adaptive filter; Myocontrol	MYOELECTRIC CONTROL; SURFACE-EMG; CROSS-TALK; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; EEG	The use of electromyography (EMG) for the control of upper-limb prostheses has received great interest in neurorehabilitation engineering since decades. Important advances have been performed in the development of machine learning algorithms for myocontrol. This paper describes a novel adaptive filter for EMG preprocessing to be applied as conditioning stage for optimal subsequent information extraction. The aim of this filter is to improve both the quality (signal-to-noise ratio) and the selectivity of the EMG recordings. The filter is based on the classic common average reference (CAR), often used in EEG processing. However, while CAR is stationary, the proposed filter, which is referred to as adaptive common average reference (ACAR), is signal-dependent and its spatial transfer function is adapted over time. The ACAR filter is evaluated in this study for noise reduction and selectivity. Furthermore, it is proven that its application improves the performance of both pattern recognition and regression methods for myoelectric control. It is concluded that the proposed novel filter for EMG conditioning is a useful preprocessing tool in myocontrol applications.

It is highly desirable to develop computational models that can predict the inhibitory effects of a compound towards CDK5 activity. In this study, two machine learning tools (naive Bayesian and recursive partitioning) were used to generate four single classifiers from a large dataset containing 462 CDK5 inhibitors and 1,500 non-inhibitors. Then, two types of consensus models [combined classifier-artificial neural networks (CC-ANNs) and consensus prediction] were applied to combine four single classifiers to obtain superior performance. The results showed that both consensus models outperformed four single classifiers, and (MCC 0.806) was superior to consensus prediction (MCC 0.711) for an external test set. To illustrate the practical applications of the CC-ANN model in virtual screening, an in-house dataset containing 29,170 compounds was screened, and 40 compounds were selected for further bioactivity assays. The assay results showed that 13 out of 40 compounds exerted CDK5/p35 inhibitory activities with IC values ranging from 9.23 to . Interestingly, three new scaffolds that had not been previously reported as CDK5 inhibitors were found in this study. These studies prove that our protocol is an effective approach to predict small-molecule CDK5 affinity and identify novel lead compounds.

The issues addressed are the sequence of training data for supervised learning and optimum parameter tuning for parameters such as baseline vigilance. A genetic algorithm search heuristic was chosen to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. To further augment the ARTMAP's pattern classification ability, multiple ARTMAPs were optimized via genetic algorithm and assembled into a classifier ensemble. An optimal ensemble was realized by the inter-classifier diversity of its constituents. This was achieved by mitigating convergence in the genetic algorithms by employing a hierarchical parallel architecture. The best-performing classifiers were then combined in an ensemble, using probabilistic voting for decision combination. This study also integrated the disparate methods to operate within a single framework, which is the proposed novel method for creating an optimum classifier ensemble configuration with minimum user intervention. The methodology was benchmarked using popular data sets from UCI machine learning repository.

To estimate relevance of attributes and select their subset for a constructed classifier typically either a filter, wrapper, or an embedded approach, is implemented. The paper presents a combined wrapper framework, where in a pre-processing step, a ranking of variables is established by a simple wrapper model employing sequential backward search procedure. Next, another predictor exploits this resulting ordering of features in their reduction. The proposed methodology is illustrated firstly for a binary classification task of authorship attribution from stylometric domain, and then for additional verification for a waveform dataset from UCI machine learning repository.

As a result, the contents of lecture materials and research publications and the research capabilities of universities should be considered in the investigations of the relationships between research and teaching. We examine the relationship between research and teaching using automatic text analysis. In particular, we scrutinize the relatedness of the content of research papers with the content of lecture materials to investigate the association between teaching and research. We adopt topic modeling for the correlation analysis of research capabilities and the reflectiveness of research topics in lecture materials. We select the field of machine learning as a case study because the field is contemporary and because data related to teaching and research are easily accessible via the Internet. The results reveal interesting characteristics of lecture materials and research publications in the field of machine learning. The research capability of an institute is independent of the lecture materials. However, for introductory courses, teaching and research measures showed a weak negative relationship, and there is little relationship between the measures for advanced courses.

Predicting future rising stars is to find brilliant scholars/researchers in co-author networks. In this paper, we propose a solution for rising star prediction by applying machine learning techniques. For classification task, discriminative and generative modeling techniques are considered and two algorithms are chosen for each category. The author, co-authorship and venue based information are incorporated, resulting in eleven features with their mathematical formulations. Extensive experiments are performed to analyze the impact of individual feature, category wise and their combination w.r.t classification accuracy. Then, two ranking lists for top 30 scholars are presented from predicted rising stars. In addition, this concept is demonstrated for prediction of rising stars in database domain. Data from DBLP and Arnetminer databases (1996-2000 for wide disciplines) are used for algorithms' experimental analysis.	[Daud, Ali; Malik, M. S.

TOWARD CHARACTERIZATION OF THE TYPE IIP SUPERNOVA PROGENITOR POPULATION: A STATISTICAL SAMPLE OF LIGHT CURVES FROM Pan-STARRS1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						supernovae: general; surveys	CORE-COLLAPSE SUPERNOVAE; M-CIRCLE-DOT; GALACTIC CHEMICAL EVOLUTION; MASSIVE STAR EVOLUTION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; P SUPERNOVAE; PLATEAU SUPERNOVAE; IA SUPERNOVAE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM	In recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multiband imaging have presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitor populations of core-collapse supernovae (SNe): systematic light-curve studies. We assemble a set of 76 grizy-band Type IIP SN light curves from Pan-STARRS1, obtained over a constant survey program of 4 yr and classified using both spectroscopy and machine-learning-based photometric techniques. We develop and apply a new Bayesian model for the full multiband evolution of each light curve in the sample. We find no evidence of a subpopulation of fast-declining explosions (historically referred to as "Type IIL" SNe). However, we identify a highly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peak luminosity among our SNe IIP. These results argue in favor of a single parameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controlling the explosions of red supergiants. This relation could also be applied for SN cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsic scatter of less than or similar to 0.2mag. We compare each light curve to physical models from hydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and other properties of the Pan-STARRS1 Type IIP SN sample. We show that correction of systematic discrepancies between modeled and observed SN IIP light-curve properties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties are needed to enable robust progenitor inferences from multiband light-curve samples of this kind. This work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapse SNe to be conducted through future wide-field transient searches.	[Sanders, N. E.; Soderberg, A.

We aimed to improve sensitivity and specificity of prediction methods, and to reduce the number of false alarms. Methods: Relative combinations of sub-band spectral powers of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings across all possible channel pairs were utilized for tracking gradual changes preceding seizures. By using a specifically developed feature selection method, a set of best candidate features were fed to support vector machines in order to discriminate cerebral state as preictal or non-preictal. Results: Proposed algorithm was evaluated on continuous long-term multichannel scalp and invasive recordings (183 seizures, 3565 h). The best results demonstrated a sensitivity of 75.8% (66 out of 87 seizures) and a false prediction rate of 0.1 h (1). Performance was validated statistically, and was superior to that of analytical random predictor. Conclusion: Applying machine learning methods on a reduced subset of proposed features could predict seizure onsets with high performance. Significance: Our method was evaluated on long-term continuous recordings of overall about 5 months, contrary to majority of previous studies using short-term fragmented data. It is of very low computational cost, while providing acceptable levels of alarm sensitivity and specificity. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

This paper focuses on the investigation of the consumption patterns of an existing high voltage industrial consumer. The profiling process involves stages like the normalization of the recorded load data, the utilization of pattern recognition algorithms, the selection of the appropriate validation scheme and the exploitation of the profiling findings. Certain improvements are proposed for each of these stages. More specifically, the most common algorithms of the related literature are implemented and a detailed investigation of their performance is presented. A new algorithm is proposed, presenting, in the majority of the cases, the best performance. Additionally, all the clustering validity indicators of the literature are considered to evaluate the clustering results. After the formulation of the load curve clusters, the load profiles are extracted and based on specific indices conclusions are drawn regarding the implementation of suitable demand side management schemes.

Exploratory Landscape Analysis of Continuous Space Optimization Problems Using Information Content	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Fitness landscape; function classification; knowledge acquisition; landscape analysis; unconstrained optimization	FITNESS LANDSCAPES; RUGGEDNESS; ENTROPY	Data-driven analysis methods, such as the information content of a fitness sequence, characterize a discrete fitness landscape by quantifying its smoothness, ruggedness, or neutrality. However, enhancements to the information content method are required when dealing with continuous fitness landscapes. One typically employed adaptation is to sample the fitness landscape using random walks with variable step size. However, this adaptation has significant limitations: random walks may produce biased samples, and uncertainty is added because the distance between observations is not accounted for. In this paper, we introduce a robust information content-based method for continuous fitness landscapes, which addresses these limitations. Our method generates four measures related to the landscape features. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. We calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the new measures and other well-known exploratory landscape analysis measures. Significant differences on the measures between benchmark functions are subsequently identified. We then demonstrate the practical relevance of the new measures using them as class predictors on a machine learning model, which classifies the benchmark functions into five groups. Classification accuracy greater than 90% was obtained, with computational costs bounded between 1% and 10% of the maximum function evaluation budget. The results demonstrate that our method provides relevant information, at a low cost in terms of function evaluations.

The samples projected into subspace can be processed efficiently. In this paper, we research the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and maximum margin criterion (MMC) algorithms intensively and analyze the effects of scatters to subspace selection. Meanwhile, we point out the boundaries of scatters in LDA and MMC algorithms to illustrate the differences and similarities of subspace selection in different circumstances. Besides, the effects of outlier classes on subspace selection are also analyzed. According to the above analysis, we propose a new subspace selection method called angle linear discriminant embedding (ALDE) on the basis of angle measurement. ALDE utilizes the cosine of the angle to get new within-class and between-class scatter matrices and avoids the small sample size problem simultaneously. To deal with high-dimensional data, we extend ALDE to a two-stage ALDE (TS-ALDE). The synthetic data experiments indicate that ALDE can balance the within-class and between-class scatters and be robust to outlier classes. The experimental results based on UCI machine-learning repository and image databases show that TS-ALDE has a lower time complexity than ALDE while processing high-dimensional data.

The VC-dimension of the univariate decision tree depends on the VC-dimension values of its subtrees and the number of inputs. Via a search algorithm that calculates the VC-dimension of univariate decision trees exhaustively, we show that our VC-dimension bounds are tight for simple trees. To verify that the VC-dimension bounds are useful, we also use them to get VC-generalization bounds for complexity control using structural risk minimization in decision trees, i.e., pruning. Our simulation results show that structural risk minimization pruning using the VC-dimension bounds finds trees that are more accurate as those pruned using cross validation.

We present a mixed analog and digital implementation of this concept with a nonlinear analog electronic circuit as a main computational unit. In our approach, the reservoir network can be replaced by a single nonlinear element with delay via time-multiplexing. We analyze the influence of noise on the performance of the system for two benchmark tasks: 1) a classification problem and 2) a chaotic time-series prediction task. Special attention is given to the role of quantization noise, which is studied by varying the resolution in the conversion interface between the analog and digital worlds.

Digital images are increasingly transmitted over non-secure channels such as the Internet. Therefore, military, medical and quality control images must be protected against attempts to manipulate them; such manipulations could tamper the decisions based on these im- ages. To protect the authenticity of multimedia images, there are several approaches including conventional cryptography, fragile and semi-fragile watermarking and dig- ital signatures that are based on the image content. The aim of this paper is to present a review on different Machine learning techniques as Fuzzy Set Theory, Rough Set Theory, Rough K-means clustering, Near Sets and Nearness Approximation Spaces, Vector quantization, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Support Vec- tor Machine and applying them in image authentication.

It can facilitate data clustering, classification and information retrieval. As an efficient technique for dimensionality reduction, feature selection is about finding a small feature subset preserving the most relevant information. In this paper, we propose a new criterion, called maximum projection and minimum redundancy feature selection, to address unsupervised learning scenarios. First, the feature selection is formalized with the use of the projection matrices and then characterized equivalently as a matrix factorization problem. Second, an iterative update algorithm and a greedy algorithm are proposed to tackle this problem. Third, kernel techniques are considered and the corresponding algorithm is also put forward. Finally, the proposed algorithms are compared with four state-of-the-art feature selection methods. Experimental results reported for six publicly datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A persistent dilemma is that investigators have to read and manually classify thousands of individual news articles to identify how obesity and obesity-related policy proposals may be described to the public in the media. A machine learning method called automated content analysis that permits researchers to train computers to read and classify massive volumes of documents was demonstrated. Methods14,302 newspaper articles that mentioned the word obesity during 2011-2012 were identified. Four states that vary in obesity prevalence and policy (Alabama, California, New Jersey, and North Carolina) were examined. The reliability of an automated program to categorize the media's framing of obesity as an individual-level problem (e.g., diet) and/or an environmental-level problem (e.g., obesogenic environment) was tested. ResultsThe automated program performed similarly to human coders. The proportion of articles with individual-level framing (27.7-31.0%) was higher than the proportion with neutral (18.0-22.1%) or environmental-level framing (16.0-16.4%) across all states and over the entire study period (P<0.05). ConclusionsA novel approach to the study of how obesity concepts are communicated and propagated in news media was demonstrated.

Healthcare systems in smart environments that aim to address this growing social need require the support of technology to recognize and respond in an ubiquitous manner. To incorporate an efficient activity recognition and abnormality detection system in smart environments, the routine activities of the occupant are modeled and any deviation from the activity model is recognized as abnormality. Recognition systems are generally designed using machine learning strategies and in this paper a novel hybrid, data and knowledge-driven approach is introduced. Markov Logic Network (MLN) used in our design is a suitable approach for activity recognition as it integrates common sense knowledge with a probabilistic model that augments the recognition ability of the system. The proposed activity recognition system for dementia care uses a hierarchical approach to detect abnormality in occupant behavior using MLN. The abnormality in the context of dementia care is identified in terms of factors associated with the activity such as objects, location, time and duration. The task of recognition is done in a hierarchical manner based on the priority of the factor that is associated with each layer. The motivation for designing a hierarchical approach was to enable each layer to commence its computation after inferring from the lower layers that the ongoing activity was normal with regard to the associated factors. This hierarchical feature enables quick decisions, as factors that require immediate attention are processed first at the lowest layer. Experimental results indicate that the hierarchical approach has higher accuracy in recognition and efficient response time when compared to the existing approaches.	[Gayathri, K.

Dynamic sensor event segmentation for real-time activity recognition in a smart home context	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Activity recognition; Sensor segmentation; Smart home	ACCELEROMETER; SYSTEM	Activity recognition is fundamental to many of the services envisaged in pervasive computing and ambient intelligence scenarios. However, delivering sufficiently robust activity recognition systems that could be deployed with confidence in an arbitrary real-world setting remains an outstanding challenge. Developments in wireless, inexpensive and unobtrusive sensing devices have enabled the capture of large data volumes, upon which a variety of machine learning techniques have been applied in order to facilitate interpretation of and inference upon such data. Much of the documented research in this area has in the main focused on recognition across pre-segmented sensor data. Such approaches are insufficient for near real-time analysis as is required for many services, such as those envisaged by ambient assisted living. This paper presents a novel near real-time sensor segmentation approach that incorporates the notions of both sensor and time correlation.	[Wan, Jie; O'Grady, Michael J.; O'Hare, Gregory M.

To this end, existing and newly developed machine learning methods are needed to be evaluated using annotated real-world data sets. However, the metrics used in performance evaluation are directly taken from the machine learning domain, and they do not necessarily consider the specific needs of human behaviour analysis such as recognizing the duration, start time and frequency of the activities. Moreover, the commonly used metrics such as accuracy or F-measure can be misleading in the presence of skewed class distributions as in the case of human behaviour recognition. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two machine learning methods, hidden Markov model and time windowed neural network on five different real-world data sets through human behaviour understanding for health assessment perspective. According to the experimental results, standard metrics fail to reveal the actual performance of the two compared machine learning methods in terms of behaviour recognition. On the other hand, the proposed evaluation mechanism which considers three different activity categories leads to a more realistic evaluation of the overall performance.

Impact factor analysis: combining prediction with parameter ranking to reveal the impact of behavior on health outcome	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Health and behavior; Machine learning; Mental health; Bipolar disorder		An increasing number of healthcare systems allow people to monitor behavior and provide feedback on health and wellness. Most applications, however, only offer feedback on behavior in form of visualization and data summaries. This paper presents a different approach-called impact factor analysis-in which machine learning techniques are used to infer the progression of a primary health parameter and then apply parameter ranking to investigate which behavioral data have the highest 'impact' on health. We have applied this approach to improve the MONARCA personal health application for patients suffering from bipolar disorder. In the MONARCA system, patients report their daily mood score and by analyzing self-reported and automatically sensed behavioral data with this mood score, the system is able to identify the impact of different behavior on the patient's mood. We report from a study involving ten bipolar patients, in which we were able to estimate mood values with an average mean absolute error of 0.5. This was used to rank the behavior parameters whose variations indicate changes in the mental state. The rankings acquired from our algorithms correspond to the patients' rankings, identifying physical activity and sleep as the highest impact parameters. These results revealed the feasibility of identifying behavioral impact factors. This data analysis motivated us to design an impact factor inference engine as part of the MONARCA system. To our knowledge, this is a novel approach in monitoring and control of mental illness, and we argue that the impact factor analysis can be useful in the design of other health and wellness systems.

Its task is to identify sample points markedly deviating from the normal data. A reliable outlier detector needs to build a model which encloses the normal data tightly. In this paper, an improved one-class SVM (OC-SVM) classifier is proposed for outlier detection problems. We name this method OC-SVM with minimum within-class scatter (OC-WCSSVM), which exploits the inner-class structure of the training set via minimizing the within-class scatter of the training data. This can construct a more accurate hyperplane for outlier detection, such that the margin between the training data and the origin in a higher dimensional space is as large as possible, while at the same time the decision boundary around the normal data is as tight as possible. Experimental results on a synthetic dataset and 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed OC-WCSSVM algorithm is effective and superior to the compared algorithms.

Advanced classification of carbonate sediments based on physical properties	SEDIMENTOLOGY			English	Article						Carbonate sediment; corals; core descriptions; machine learning; microbialite; physical properties	RANDOM FORESTS; EXTRACTION; SHELF; REEF	Physical properties such as bulk density (gamma ray attenuation), P-wave velocity (primary or compressional wave acoustic velocity), electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility are related to characteristics of the marine sediments that, in turn, are indicative of the lithology. Non-destructive physical properties are routinely measured during Mission Specific Platform expeditions conducted by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program using a multi-sensor core logger on whole cores. The goal of this study was to develop linear and non-linear relations among physical properties and different types of carbonate sediment to identify relevant information that may aid in the classification of carbonates. The database and model presented here integrate sedimentology with physical properties data. Data were analysed using three techniques: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. The models that best describe the nature of the data are Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, reaching up to 79% and 74% total accuracy, respectively. This article presents an application of machine learning as a potentially useful tool for classifying sediment types, developed specifically for assisting with the challenging identification of the lithologies in coral cores. This technique can also be used for provisional core description prior to splitting, thereby enabling identification and preservation of potentially critical intervals for special analyses and studies. These methods of data analysis can also assist with sample selection for specific studies. Other applications include the interpretation of lithotypes from wireline geophysical logging data, particularly in boreholes where core recovery is poor or sampling is limited to drill cuttings.

The SVM and ANN approaches were applied to the monthly precipitation data of two synoptic stations in Hamadan (Airport and Nojeh), the west of Iran. To avoid overfitting, the data were divided into two parts of training (70 %) and test sets (30 %). Then, monthly data from July 1976 to June 2001 and data from April 1961 to November 1996 were considered as training set for the Hamadan and Nojeh stations, respectively, and the remaining were used as test set. The results of the SVM model were compared with those of the ANN based on the root mean square errors, mean absolute errors, determination coefficient, and efficiency coefficient criteria. Based on the comparison, it was found that the SVM model outperformed the ANN, and the estimated precipitation values were in good agreement with the corresponding observed values.

Determining the status of these data-deficient (DD) species is essential to developing an accurate picture of global biodiversity and identifying potentially threatened DD species. To address this knowledge gap, we used predictive models incorporating species' life history, geography, and threat information to predict the conservation status of DD terrestrial mammals. We constructed the models with 7 machine learning (ML) tools trained on species of known status. The resultant models showed very high species classification accuracy (up to 92%) and ability to correctly identify centers of threatened species richness. Applying the best model to DD species, we predicted 313 of 493 DD species (64%) to be at risk of extinction, which increases the estimated proportion of threatened terrestrial mammals from 22% to 27%. Regions predicted to contain large numbers of threatened DD species are already conservation priorities, but species in these areas show considerably higher levels of risk than previously recognized. We conclude that unless directly targeted for monitoring, species classified as DD are likely to go extinct without notice. Taking into account information on DD species may therefore help alleviate data gaps in biodiversity indicators and conserve poorly known biodiversity. Predeccion del Estado de Conservacion de Especies con Deficiencia de Datos Resumen Existe poca apreciacion del nivel de riesgo de extincion que enfrenta un sexto de las mas de 65, 000 especies evaluadas por la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza. La determinacion el estado de estas especies con deficiencia de datos (DD) es esencial para desarrollar una imagen precisa de la biodiversidad global e identificar a las especies con DD potencialmente amenazadas. Para enfocarnos en esta interrupcion en el conocimiento, usamos modelos predictivos incorporando la historia de vida de las especies, geografia e informacion sobre las amenazas para predecir el estado de conservacion de mamiferos terrestres con DD. Construimos los modelos con siete herramientas que aprenden de maquinas (ML, en ingles) entrenadas con especies de estado conocido. Los modelos resultantes mostraron una precision muy alta en la clasificacion de especies (hasta 92%) y una habilidad muy alta para identificar correctamente centros de riqueza de especies amenazadas. Al aplicar el mejor modelo a las especies con DD, pronosticamos que 313 de las 493 especies con DD (64%) se encuentran en riesgo de extincion, lo que incrementa la proporcion estimada de mamiferos terrestres amenazadas de 22% a 27%. Las regiones que se predijo tendrian un gran numero de especies con DD amenazadas ya son prioridades de conservacion, pero las especies en estas areas muestran un nivel de riesgo considerablemente mas alto que el que se reconocia previamente. Concluimos que a menos que sean objetivo directo de monitoreo, las especies clasificadas como especies con DD probablemente se extingan sin que nos enteremos. Tomar en cuenta la informacion sobre las especies con DD por lo tanto puede ayudar a aliviar la interrupcion de datos en los indicadores de la biodiversidad y a conservar a la biodiversidad de la que se conoce poco.

J	Halvorsen, R; Mazzoni, S; Bryn, A; Bakkestuen, V				Halvorsen, Rune; Mazzoni, Sabrina; Bryn, Anders; Bakkestuen, Vegar			Opportunities for improved distribution modelling practice via a strict maximum likelihood interpretation of MaxEnt	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; ABSENCE DATA; EXPLANATORY VARIABLES; STATISTICAL MECHANICS; INFORMATION THEORY; HABITAT MODELS; NICHE MODELS; PROBABILITY; PREDICTION; SELECTION	Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling, as implemented in the Maxent software, has rapidly become one of the most popular methods for distribution modelling. Originally, MaxEnt was described as a machine-learning method. More recently, it has been explained from principles of Bayesian estimation. MaxEnt offers numerous options (variants of the method) and settings (tuning of parameters) to the users. A widespread practice of accepting the Maxent software's default options and settings has been established, most likely because of ecologists' lack of familiarity with machine-learning and Bayesian statistical concepts and the ease by which the default models are obtained in Maxent. However, these defaults have been shown, in many cases, to be suboptimal and exploration of alternatives has repeatedly been called for. In this paper, we derive MaxEnt from strict maximum likelihood principles, and point out parallels between MaxEnt and standard modelling tools like generalised linear models (GLM). Furthermore, we describe several new options opened by this new derivation of MaxEnt, which may improve MaxEnt practice. The most important of these is the option for selecting variables by subset selection methods instead of the (1)-regularisation method, which currently is the Maxent software default. Other new options include: incorporation of new transformations of explanatory variables and user control of the transformation process; improved variable contribution measures and options for variation partitioning; and improved output prediction formats. The new options are exemplified for a data set for the plant species Scorzonera humilis in SE Norway, which was analysed by the standard MaxEnt procedure in a previously published paper. We recommend that thorough comparisons between the proposed alternative options and default procedures and variants thereof be carried out.

J	Hu, QR; Li, FX; Chen, CF				Hu, Qinran; Li, Fangxing; Chen, Chien-fei			A Smart Home Test Bed for Undergraduate Education to Bridge the Curriculum Gap From Traditional Power Systems to Modernized Smart Grids	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						Demand response; energy management system; power system education; project-based learning (PBL); research experience for undergraduates (REU); senior design; smart grids; smart home	ENERGY MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; PREDICTION	There is a worldwide trend to modernize old power grid infrastructures to form future smart grids, which will achieve efficient, flexible energy consumption by using the latest technologies in communication, computing, and control. Smart grid initiatives are moving power systems curricula toward smart grids. Although the components of smart grids fall within the broader discipline of electrical and computer engineering, undergraduate students are rarely assigned single design projects that require classic power systems knowledge combined with communication, computing, and control. Therefore, as a significant step toward potential curriculum changes, this paper presents such a project, a smart home test bed based on the pedagogical model of project-based learning (PBL) for undergraduate education. The proposed test bed allows undergraduates to gain key knowledge in smart grid topics, such as flattening demand peaks, real-time price response, wireless sensor networks, machine learning, pattern recognition, embedded system programming, user interface design, circuit design, and databases. This is well aligned with smart grid initiatives and provides a platform for students to develop their creativity in engineering design. It also offers real-life examples to be used for raising general public awareness of energy conservation.

J	Fazendeiro, P; de Oliveira, JV				Fazendeiro, Paulo; de Oliveira, Jose Valente			Observer-Biased Fuzzy Clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering algorithms; fuzzy clustering; fuzzy c-means (FCM); machine learning; pattern recognition; shrinkage	NUMBER; ALGORITHMS; VALIDITY; MODEL	As generated by clustering algorithms, clusterings (or partitions) are hypotheses on data explanation which are better evaluated by experts fromthe application domain. In general, clustering algorithms allow a limited usage of domain knowledge about the cluster formation process. In this study, we propose both a design technique and a new partitioning-based clustering algorithm which can be used to assist the data analyst while looking for a set of meaningful clusters, i.e., clusters that actually correspond to the underlying data structure. Following an observer metaphor according to which the perception of a group of objects depends on the observer position-the closer an observer is from an image more details (s) he perceives-we resort to shrinkage to incorporate a regularization term, accounting for the observation point, within the objective function of an otherwise unbiased clustering algorithm. This technique allows our resulting biased algorithm to generate a set of reasonable partitions, i.e., partitions validated by a given cluster validity index, corresponding to views of data with different levels of granularity (levels of detail) in different regions of the data space. For the illustration of the design technique, we adopted the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm as the unbiased clustering algorithm and include a convergence theorem assuring that changing the point of observation in the corresponding biased algorithm FCM with focal point (FCMFP) does not jeopardize its convergence. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real data are included to illustrate the usefulness of the approach. In addition, and as a convenient side effect of using shrinkage, the experimental results suggest that our biased algorithm (FCMFP) not only seems to scale better than the successive runs of the unbiased one (FCM) but on the average, seems to produce clusters exhibiting higher validity index values as well. In addition, less sensitivity to initialization was observed for the biased algorithm when compared with the unbiased one.

The problem is formulated as a classification task to identify the class of riding patterns using data collected from 3-D accelerometer/gyroscope sensors mounted on motorcycles. These measurements constitute an experimental database used to analyze powered two-wheeler rider behavior. Several well-known machine-learning techniques are investigated, including the Gaussian mixture models, the k-nearest neighbor model, the support vector machines, the random forests, and the hidden Markov models (HMMs), for both discrete and continuous cases. Additionally, an approach for sensor selection is proposed to identify the significant measurements for improved riding pattern recognition. The experimental study, performed on a real data set, shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and the effectiveness of the HMM approach in riding pattern recognition. These results encourage the development of these methodologies in the context of naturalistic riding studies.

Both computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and content-based image-retrieval (CBIR) systems have been successfully developed for diagnosis, disease detection, and decision support in this area. Recently, with the ever-increasing amount of annotated medical data, large-scale and data-driven methods have emerged to offer a promise of bridging the semantic gap between images and diagnostic information. In this paper, we focus on developing scalable image-retrieval techniques to cope intelligently with massive histopathological images. Specifically, we present a supervised kernel hashing technique which leverages a small amount of supervised information in learning to compress a 10 000-dimensional image feature vector into only tens of binary bits with the informative signatures preserved. These binary codes are then indexed into a hash table that enables real-time retrieval of images in a large database. Critically, the supervised information is employed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level diagnostic information. We build a scalable image-retrieval framework based on the supervised hashing technique and validate its performance on several thousand histopathological images acquired from breast microscopic tissues. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of image classification (i.e., benign versus actionable categorization) and retrieval tests. Our framework achieves about 88.1% classification accuracy as well as promising time efficiency. For example, the framework can execute around 800 queries in only 0.01 s, comparing favorably with other commonly used dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods.

The RF time series method is versatile and requires only a few seconds of raw ultrasound data with no need for additional instrumentation. Using the RF time series features, and a machine learning framework, we have generated malignancy maps, from the estimated cancer likelihood, for decision support in biopsy recommendation. These maps depict the likelihood of malignancy for regions of size mm within the suspicious lesions. We report an area under receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84%-0.90%) using support vector machines and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.85) using Random Forests classification algorithms, on 22 subjects with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Changing the classification method yielded consistent results which indicates the robustness of this tissue typing method. The findings of this report suggest that ultrasound RF time series, along with the developed machine learning framework, can help in differentiating malignant from benign breast lesions, subsequently reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies after mammography screening.

One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures. This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call competitive fragmentation modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum). In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.

This behavior increases the obsolescence rate of used still-functional products leading to lower profitability that could be resulted out of End-of-Use (EOU) treatments such as reuse, upgrade, and refurbishment. These types of behaviors are influenced by several product and consumer-related factors such as consumers' traits and lifestyles, technology evolution, product design features, product market value, and pro-environmental stimuli. Better understanding of different groups of consumers, their utilization and storage behavior and the connection of these behaviors with product design features helps Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and recycling and recovery industry to better overcome the challenges resulting from the undesirable storage of used products. This paper aims at providing insightful statistical analysis of Electronic Waste (e-waste) dynamic nature by studying the effects of design characteristics, brand and consumer type on the electronics usage time and end of use time-in-storage. A database consisting of 10,063 Hard Disk Drives (HDD) of used personal computers returned back to a remanufacturing facility located in Chicago, IL, USA during 2011-2013 has been selected as the base for this study. The results show that commercial consumers have stored computers more than household consumers regardless of brand and capacity factors. Moreover, a heterogeneous storage behavior is observed for different brands of HDDs regardless of capacity and consumer type factors. Finally, the storage behavior trends are projected for short-time forecasting and the storage times are precisely predicted by applying machine learning methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

On Automatic Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Spontaneous Speech Analysis and Emotional Temperature	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; Spontaneous speech; Emotion recognition	DEMENTIA	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of progressive degenerative dementia; it has a high socioeconomic impact in Western countries. Therefore, it is one of the most active research areas today. Alzheimer's disease is sometimes diagnosed by excluding other dementias, and definitive confirmation is only obtained through a postmortem study of the brain tissue of the patient. The work presented here is part of a larger study that aims to identify novel technologies and biomarkers for early AD detection, and it focuses on evaluating the suitability of a new approach for early diagnosis of AD by noninvasive methods. The purpose is to examine, in a pilot study, the potential of applying machine learning algorithms to speech features obtained from suspected Alzheimer's disease sufferers in order to help diagnose this disease and determine its degree of severity. Two human capabilities relevant in communication have been analyzed for feature selection: spontaneous speech and emotional response. The experimental results obtained were very satisfactory and promising for the early diagnosis and classification of AD patients.

Pre-operative prediction of surgical morbidity in children: Comparison of five statistical models	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Data mining; Machine learning; Prediction; Boosting; Random forests; Support vector machines; Logistic regression; Surgical morbidity; Pediatrics	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; RISK CALCULATOR; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MORTALITY; IMPROVEMENT; SURGEONS; OUTCOMES; VALIDATION	Background: The accurate prediction of surgical risk is important to patients and physicians. Logistic regression (LR) models are typically used to estimate these risks. However, in the fields of data mining and machine-learning, many alternative classification and prediction algorithms have been developed. This study aimed to compare the performance of LR to several data mining algorithms for predicting 30-day surgical morbidity in children. Methods: We used the 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric dataset to compare the performance of (1) a LR model that assumed linearity and additivity (simple LR model) (2) a LR model incorporating restricted cubic splines and interactions (flexible LR model) (3) a support vector machine, (4) a random forest and (5) boosted classification trees for predicting surgical morbidity. Results: The ensemble-based methods showed significantly higher accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV than the simple LR model. However, none of the models performed better than the flexible LR model in terms of the aforementioned measures or in model calibration or discrimination. Conclusion: Support vector machines, random forests, and boosted classification trees do not show better performance than LR for predicting pediatric surgical morbidity. After further validation, the flexible LR model derived in this study could be used to assist with clinical decision-making based on patient-specific surgical risks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Vyas, S; Meyerle, J; Burlina, P				Vyas, Saurabh; Meyerle, Jon; Burlina, Philippe			Non-invasive estimation of skin thickness from hyperspectral imaging and validation using echography	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Hyperspectral signatures; Ultrasound; Machine learning regression; Skin thickness		Background: The skin is the largest organ and is subject to the greatest exposure to outside elements throughout one's lifetime. Current data by the American Academy of Dermatology suggests that approximately ten people die each hour worldwide due to skin related conditions. Cancers such as melanoma are growths that originate in the epidermis. Therefore, an accurate and non-invasive method to estimate skin constitutive elements can play an important clinical role in detecting the early onset of skin tumors. It can also serve as a valuable tool for research and development in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals in general. Methods: In our prior work, we developed a method that combined a physics-based model of human skin with machine learning and Hyperspectral imaging to non-invasively estimate physiological skin parameters, including melanosomes, collagen, oxygen saturation, and blood volume. In this work, we extend that model to also estimate skin thickness. Moreover, for the first time, we develop a protocol to test our methodology for skin thickness estimation using Ultrasound to acquire a gold standard dataset. Results: We tested our methodology for skin thickness estimation on a dataset of 48 Hyperspectral signatures obtained in vivo from six patients under IRE at Johns Hopkins Hospital. We found mean absolute errors on the order of the Ultrasound resolution (i.e., our gold standard). Discussion: This is the first study of its kind to validate skin thickness estimates using a gold standard. Our preliminary results constitute a proof-of-concept that hyperspectral-based methods can accurately and non-invasively estimate skin thickness in clinical settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lee, BJ; Kim, JY				Lee, Bum Ju; Kim, Jong Yeol			Indicators of hypertriglyceridemia from anthropometric measures based on data mining	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Hypertriglyceridemia; Data mining; Prediction; Triglycerides; Anthropometry; Statistical data analysis; Machine learning	CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY; BODY-MASS INDEX; TO-HIP RATIO; METABOLIC SYNDROME; WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE; FAT DISTRIBUTION; ABDOMINAL OBESITY; NATIONAL-HEALTH	Background: The best indicator for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia derived from anthropometric measures of body shape remains a matter of debate. The objectives are to determine the strongest predictor of hypertriglyceridemia from anthropometric measures and to investigate whether a combination of measures can improve the prediction accuracy compared with individual measures. Methods: A total of 5517 subjects aged 20-90 years participated in this study. The numbers of normal and hypertriglyceridemia subjects were 3022 and 653 females, respectively, and 1306 and 536 males, respectively. We evaluated 33 anthropometric measures for the prediction of hypertriglyceridemia using statistical analysis and data mining. Results: In the 20-90-year-old groups, age in women was the variable that exhibited the highest predictive power; however, this was not the case in men in all age groups. Of the anthropometric measures, the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia in women. In men, the rib-to-forehead circumference ratio (RFcR) was the strongest indicator. The use of a combination of measures provides better predictive power compared with individual measures in both women and men. However, in the subgroups of ages 20-50 and 51-90 years, the strongest indicators for hypertriglyceridemia were rib circumference in the 20-50-year-old group and WHtR in the 51-90-year-old group in women and RFcR in the 20-50-year-old group and BMI in the 51-90-year-old group in men. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the best predictor of hypertriglyceridemia may differ according to gender and age. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, to classify both control subjects and a large sample of patients with ASD, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and a neural network. Imaging data from 312 subjects with ASD and 328 subjects with typical development was downloaded from the multi-center research project. Only subjects under 20 years of age were included in this analysis. Correlation matrices computed from rs-fMRI time-series data were entered into a probabilistic neural network (PNN) for classification. The PNN classified the two groups with approximately 90% accuracy (sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 87%). The accuracy of classification did not differ among the institutes, or with respect to experimental and imaging conditions, sex, handedness, or intellectual level. Medication status and degree of head movement did not affect accuracy values. The present study indicates that an intrinsic connectivity matrix produced from rs-fMRI data could yield a possible biomarker of ASD. These results support the view that altered network connectivity within the brain contributes to the neurobiology of ASD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper we propose a novel hybrid forecasting methodology that combines the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) from the field of signal processing with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) methodology that originates from machine learning. We test the forecasting ability of the proposed model against a Random Walk (RW), a Bayesian Autoregressive and a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive model. The proposed methodology outperforms all the competing models with half the error of the RW model with and without drift in out-of-sample forecasting. Finally, we argue that this new methodology can be used as an early warning system for forecasting sudden house price drops with direct policy implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Viseh, S; Ghovanloo, M; Mohsenin, T				Viseh, Sina; Ghovanloo, Maysam; Mohsenin, Tinoosh			Toward an Ultralow-Power Onboard Processor for Tongue Drive System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS			English	Article						Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC); field-programmable gate array (FPGA); low power; machine learning; onboard processor; personalized assistive device; wearable biomedical device		The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a new unobtrusive, wireless, and wearable assistive device that allows for real-time tracking of the voluntary tongue motion in the oral space for communication, control, and navigation applications. The latest TDS prototype appears as a wireless headphone and has been tested in human subject trials. However, the robustness of the external TDS (eTDS) in real-life outdoor conditions may not meet safety regulations because of the limited mechanical stability of the headset. The intraoral TDS (iTDS), which is in the shape of a dental retainer, firmly clasps to the upper teeth and resists sensor misplacement. However, the iTDS has more restrictions on its dimensions, limiting the battery size and consequently requiring a considerable reduction in its power consumption to operate over an extended period of two days on a single charge. In this brief, we propose an ultralow-power local processor for the TDS that performs all signal processing on the transmitter side, following the sensors. Assuming the TDS user on average issuing one command/s, implementing the computational engine reduces the data volume that needs to be wirelessly transmitted to a PC or smartphone by a factor of 1500x, from 12 kb/s to similar to 8 b/s. The proposed design is implemented on an ultralow-power IGLOO nano field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and is tested on AGLN250 prototype board. According to our post-place-and-route results, implementing the engine on the FPGA significantly drops the required data transmission, while an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation in a 65-nm CMOS results in a 15x power saving compared to the FPGA solution and occupies a 0.02-mm(2) footprint. As a result, the power consumption and size of the iTDS will be significantly reduced through the use of a much smaller rechargeable battery. Moreover, the system can operate longer following every recharge, improving the iTDS usability.

The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model including showing its construction as the continuum limit of a nested Chinese restaurant process model. We then present two alternative MCMC samplers which allow us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary.

A Survey of Non-Exchangeable Priors for Bayesian Nonparametric Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Bayesian nonparametrics; non-exchangeable data; dependent stochastic processes; dependent Dirichlet processes	DIRICHLET PROCESSES	Dependent nonparametric processes extend distributions over measures, such as the Dirichlet process and the beta process, to give distributions over collections of measures, typically indexed by values in some covariate space. Such models are appropriate priors when exchangeability assumptions do not hold, and instead we want our model to vary fluidly with some set of covariates. Since the concept of dependent nonparametric processes was formalized by MacEachern, there have been a number of models proposed and used in the statistics and machine learning literatures. Many of these models exhibit underlying similarities, an understanding of which, we hope, will help in selecting an appropriate prior, developing new models, and leveraging inference techniques.

What makes these tasks hard is that often we do not have a natural representation with which to model the domain and use for choosing actions; we must learn about the domain's properties while simultaneously performing the task. Learning a representation also involves trade-offs between modeling the data that we have seen previously and being able to make predictions about new data. This article explores learning representations of stochastic systems using Bayesian nonparametric statistics. Bayesian nonparametric methods allow the sophistication of a representation to scale gracefully with the complexity in the data. Our main contribution is a careful empirical evaluation of how representations learned using Bayesian nonparametric methods compare to other standard learning approaches, especially in support of planning and control. We show that the Bayesian aspects of the methods result in achieving state-of-the-art performance in decision making with relatively few samples, while the nonparametric aspects often result in fewer computations. These results hold across a variety of different techniques for choosing actions given a representation.

The simplest possible models subdivide nodes of the network into clusters; the probability of a link between any two nodes then depends only on their cluster assignment. Currently available models can be classified by whether clusters are disjoint or are allowed to overlap. These models can explain a "flat" clustering structure. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural approach to capture more complex dependencies. We propose a model in which objects are characterised by a latent feature vector. Each feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups (subclusters), corresponding to a second layer of hierarchy. In experimental comparisons, the model achieves significantly improved predictive performance on social and biological link prediction tasks. The results indicate that models with a single layer hierarchy over-simplify real networks.

Recent experimental techniques revealed that the majority of mammalian genomes and other complex organisms are in fact transcribed into non-coding RNAs. Typically, non-coding RNAs are small nucleotide sequences that are not transcribed into proteins and have a profound regulatory role. Present advances in computational biosciences linked their abnormal functionality to many diseases and re-stated the principles of basic therapeutic strategies. The effective identification of non-coding RNAs and their biological role emerges as a new and challenging bioinformatics problem. ncRNAclass ( http://biotools.ceid.upatras.gr/ncrnaclass/) is a web platform that allows for efficient computation of a set of features that can describe effectively the broad class of non-coding RNAs. Moreover, it enables the calculation of features that include information about the targeting behavior of miRNAs. The tool operates under a user-friendly interface and its pilot implementation incorporates prediction models for the well-known class of microRNAs and for prediction their mRNA targets. The prediction models are based on two novel evolutionary Machine Learning algorithms that achieve very high classification performance in comparison with existing methods. The platform is also equipped with a data warehouse, with manually curated sequences, that enables fast information retrieval and data mining utilities.

Robust Classifiers Using Imprecise Probability Models and Importance of Classes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Machine learning; classification; support vector machine; imprecise probability model; minimax strategy; extreme points; quadratic programming	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REGULARIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	A framework for constructing robust classification models is proposed in the paper. An assumption about importance of one of the classes in comparison with other classes is incorporated into the models. It often takes place in the real application, for example, in reliability, in medical diagnostic, etc. A main idea underlying the models is to consider a set of probability distributions on training examples produced by the imprecise probability models such as linear-vacuous mixture and constant odd-ratio contaminated models. Extreme points of the sets of probability distributions are a main tool for constructing the robust classifiers. It is shown that algorithms for computing optimal classification parameters are reduced to a finite number of weighted support vector machines with weights determined by the extreme points. Experimental results with synthetic and real data illustrate the proposed models.

The purpose of the present study was to explore text characteristics specifically in relation to early-grades text complexity. Three hundred fifty primary-grades texts were selected and digitized. Twenty-two text characteristics were identified at 4 linguistic levels, and multiple computerized operationalizations were created for each of the 22 text characteristics. A researcher-devised text-complexity outcome measure was based on teacher judgment of text complexity in the 350 texts as well as on student judgment of text complexity as gauged by their responses in a maze task for a subset of the 350 texts. Analyses were conducted using a logical analytical progression typically used in machine-learning research. Random forest regression was the primary statistical modeling technique. Nine text characteristics were most important for early-grades text complexity including word structure (decoding demand and number of syllables in words), word meaning (age of acquisition, abstractness, and word rareness), and sentence and discourse-level characteristics (intersentential complexity, phrase diversity, text density/information load, and noncompressibility). Notably, interplay among text characteristics was important to explanation of text complexity, particularly for subsets of texts.

In abdominal surgeries, understanding blood vessel structure is critical since it is very complicated. The input of the proposed method is the blood vessel region extracted from the CT volume. The blood vessel region is expressed as a tree structure by applying a thinning process to it and compute the mapping from the branches in the tree structure to the anatomical names. First, several characteristic anatomical names are assigned by rule-based pre-processing. The branches assigned to these names are used as references. The remaining blood vessel names are assigned using a likelihood function trained by a machine-learning technique. Simple rule-based postprocessing can correct several blood vessel names. The output of the proposed method is a tree structure with anatomical names. In an experiment using 50 blood vessel regions manually extracted from abdominal CT volumes, the recall and precision rates of the abdominal arteries were 86.2% and 85.3%, and they were 86.5% and 79.5% for the hepatic portal system.

J	Zhang, SX; Han, JQ; Liu, J; Zheng, JG; Liu, RL				Zhang, Shanxin; Han, Jiuqiang; Liu, Jun; Zheng, Jiguang; Liu, Ruiling			An improved poly(A) motifs recognition method based on decision level fusion	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Polyadenylation motifs; Support vector machine; Oligo string kernel; Increment of diversity; Evidence theory	GENOME-WIDE IDENTIFICATION; RNA POLYADENYLATION SITES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HUMAN DNA-SEQUENCES; ALTERNATIVE POLYADENYLATION; PREDICTION; SIGNALS; GENES	Polyadenylation is the process of addition of poly(A) tail to mRNA 3' ends. Identification of motifs controlling polyadenylation plays an essential role in improving genome annotation accuracy and better understanding of the mechanisms governing gene regulation. The bioinformatics methods used for poly (A) motifs recognition have demonstrated that information extracted from sequences surrounding the candidate motifs can differentiate true motifs from the false ones greatly. However, these methods depend on either domain features or string kernels. To date, methods combining information from different sources have not been found yet. Here, we proposed an improved poly(A) motifs recognition method by combing different sources based on decision level fusion. First of all, two novel prediction methods was proposed based on support vector machine (SVM): one method is achieved by using the domain-specific features and principle component analysis (PCA) method to eliminate the redundancy (PCA-SVM); the other method is based on Oligo string kernel (Oligo-SVM). Then we proposed a novel machine-learning method for poly(A) motif prediction by marrying four poly(A) motifs recognition methods, including two state-of-the-art methods (Random Forest (RF) and HMM-SVM), and two novel proposed methods (PCA-SVM and Oligo-SVM). A decision level information fusion method was employed to combine the decision values of different classifiers by applying the DS evidence theory. We evaluated our method on a comprehensive poly(A) dataset that consists of 14,740 samples on 12 variants of poly(A) motifs and 2750 samples containing none of these motifs. Our method has achieved accuracy up to 86.13%. Compared with the four classifiers, our evidence theory based method reduces the average error rate by about 30%, 27%, 26% and 16%, respectively. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method is more effective for poly(A) motif recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Emerging reports indicate that the tumour microenvironment and heterogeneity can limit the predictive power of current biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Here we report the engineering of personalized tumour ecosystems that contextually conserve the tumour heterogeneity, and phenocopy the tumour microenvironment using tumour explants maintained in defined tumour grade-matched matrix support and autologous patient serum. The functional response of tumour ecosystems, engineered from 109 patients, to anticancer drugs, together with the corresponding clinical outcomes, is used to train a machine learning algorithm; the learned model is then applied to predict the clinical response in an independent validation group of 55 patients, where we achieve 100% sensitivity in predictions while keeping specificity in a desired high range. The tumour ecosystem and algorithm, together termed the CANScript technology, can emerge as a powerful platform for enabling personalized medicine.

It offers mass customization and exemplifies personalized manufacturing services. Once a print order is submitted to the print factory by a client, the print service provider (PSP) needs to make a real-time decision on whether to accept or refuse this order. Based on the print factory's current capacity and the order's properties and requirements, an order is refused if its acceptance is not profitable for the PSP. The order is accepted with the most appropriate due date in order to maximize the profit that can result from this order. We have developed an automated learning-based order admission framework that can be embedded into an enterprise environment to provide real-time admission decisions for new orders. The framework consists of three classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Bayesian Probabilistic Model (BPM). The classifiers are trained by history orders and used to predict completion status for new orders. A decision integration technique is implemented to combine the results of the classifiers and predict due dates. Experimental results derived using real factory data from a leading print service provider and Weka open-source software show that the order completion status prediction accuracy is significantly improved by the decision integration strategy. The proposed multiclassifier model also outperforms a standalone regression model.

To avoid simulating all configurations in the design space, machine learning and statistical techniques have been utilized to build regression models for characterizing the relationship between architectural configurations and responses (e.g., performance or power consumption). However, this article shows that the accuracy variability of many learning techniques over different design spaces and benchmarks can be significant enough to mislead the decision-making. This clearly indicates a high risk of applying techniques that work well on previous modeling tasks (each involving a design space, benchmark, and design objective) to a new task, due to which the powerful tools might be impractical. Inspired by ensemble learning in the machine learning domain, we propose a robust framework called ELSE to reduce the accuracy variability of design space modeling. Rather than employing a single learning technique as in previous investigations, ELSE employs distinct learning techniques to build multiple base regression models for each modeling task. This is not a trivial combination of different techniques (e.g., always trusting the regression model with the smallest error). Instead, ELSE carefully maintains the diversity of base regression models and constructs a metamodel from the base models that can provide accurate predictions even when the base models are far from accurate. Consequently, we are able to reduce the number of cases in which the final prediction errors are unacceptably large. Experimental results validate the robustness of ELSE: compared with the widely used artificial neural network over 52 distinct modeling tasks, ELSE reduces the accuracy variability by about 62%. Moreover, ELSE reduces the average prediction error by 27% and 85% for the investigated MIPS and POWER design spaces, respectively.

A single-genome assembly program (assembler) is not capable of resolving metagenome sequences, so assemblers designed specifically for metagenomics have been developed. MetaVelvet is an extension of the single-genome assembler Velvet. It has been proved to generate assemblies with higher N50 scores and higher quality than single-genome assemblers such as Velvet and SOAPdenovo when applied to metagenomic sequence reads and is frequently used in this research community. One important open problem for MetaVelvet is its low accuracy and sensitivity in detecting chimeric nodes in the assembly (de Bruijn) graph, which prevents the generation of longer contigs and scaffolds. We have tackled this problem of classifying chimeric nodes using supervised machine learning to significantly improve the performance of MetaVelvet and developed a new tool, called MetaVelvet-SL. A Support Vector Machine is used for learning the classification model based on 94 features extracted from candidate nodes. In extensive experiments, MetaVelvet-SL outperformed the original MetaVelvet and other state-of-the-art metagenomic assemblers, IDBA-UD, Ray Meta and Omega, to reconstruct accurate longer assemblies with higher N50 scores for both simulated data sets and real data sets of human gut microbial sequences.

Fast Prediction for Sparse Time Series: Demand Forecast of EV Charging Stations for Cell Phone Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Cellphone applications; electric vehicles (EVs); Kernel methods; nearest neighbor (NN) searches; prediction methods; sparse time series	HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES; SYSTEM; MODEL	This paper proposes a new cellphone application algorithm which has been implemented for the prediction of energy consumption at electric vehicle (EV) charging stations at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). For this interactive user application, the total time for accessing the database, processing the data, and making the prediction needs to be within a few seconds. We first analyze three relatively fast machine learning-based time series prediction algorithms and find that the nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm (k NN with k = 1) shows better accuracy. Considering the sparseness of the time series of the charging records, we then discuss the new algorithm based on the new proposed time-weighted dot product (TWDP) dissimilarity measure to improve the accuracy and processing time. Two applications have been designed on top of the proposed prediction algorithm: one predicts the expected available energy at the outlet and the other one predicts the expected charging finishing time. The total time, including accessing the database, data processing, and prediction is approximately 1 s for both applications. The granularity of the prediction is 1 h and the horizon is 24 h; data have been collected from 20 EV charging outlets.

The possibility of applying a temporal multilabel classification approach in the domain of nonintrusive load monitoring is explored (nonevent-based method). A novel set of metafeatures is proposed. The method is tested on sampling rates based on the capabilities of current smart meters. The proposed approach is validated over a dataset of energy readings at residences for a period of a year for 100 houses containing different sets of appliances (water heater, washing machines, etc.). This method is applicable for the demand side management of households in the current limitation of smart meters; from the inhabitants or from the grid operator's point of view.

Temporal gaps in the availability of daily climate data-the typical and preferred source for calculating growing-season variables-necessitated the use of two approaches for generating these growing-season grids. The first approach, used only for the 1950-2010 period, employed a computer script to directly calculate the suite of growing-season variables from existing daily climate grids. Since daily grids were not available for the remaining years, a second approach, which employed a machine-learning method called boosted regression trees (BRT), was used to generate statistical models that related each growing-season variable to a suite of climate and water-related predictors. These BRT models were used to generate grids of growing-season variables for each year of the study period, including the 1950-2010 period to allow comparison between the two approaches. Mean absolute errors associated with the BRT-based grids were approximately 30% higher than those associated with the daily-based grids. The two approaches were also compared by calculating trends in growing-season length over the 1950-2010 period. Significant increases in growing-season length were obtained for nearly all ecozones across Canada, and there were no significant differences in the trends obtained from the two approaches. Although the daily-based approach tended to have lower errors, the BRT approach produced comparable map products that should be valuable for periods and regions for which daily data are not available.

Expert System for Predicting Reaction Conditions: The Michael Reaction Case	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							GENOME-SCALE CLASSIFICATION; BETA-UNSATURATED COMPOUNDS; METABOLIC REACTIONS; AMINO GROUPS; DESCRIPTORS; KINETICS; FRAGMENT; ISIDA	A generic chemical transformation may often be achieved under various synthetic conditions. However, for any specific reagents, only one or a few among the reported synthetic protocols may be successful. For example, Michael beta-addition reactions may proceed under different choices of solvent (e.g., hydrophobic, aprotic polar, protic) and catalyst (e.g., Bronsted acid, Lewis acid, Lewis base, etc.). Chemoinformatics methods could be efficiently used to establish a relationship between the reagent structures and the required reaction conditions, which would allow synthetic chemists to waste less time and resources in trying out various protocols in search for the appropriate one. In order to address this problem, a number of 2-classes classification models have been built on a set of 198 Michael reactions retrieved from literature. Trained models discriminate between processes that are compatible and respectively processes not feasible under a specific reaction condition option (feasible or not with a Lewis acid catalyst, feasible or not in hydrophobic solvent, etc.). Eight distinct models were built to decide the compatibility of a Michael addition process with each considered reaction condition option, while a ninth model was aimed to predict whether the assumed Michael addition is feasible at all. Different machine-learning methods (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest) in combination with different types of descriptors (ISIDA fragments issued from Condensed Graphs of Reactions, MOLMAP, Electronic Effect Descriptors, and Chemistry Development Kit computed descriptors) have been used. Models have good predictive performance in 3-fold cross-validation done three times: balanced accuracy varies from 0.7 to 1. Developed models are available for the users at http://irifochiin.u-strasbg.fr/webserv/VStngine.html. Eventually, these were challenged to predict feasibility conditions for similar to 50 novel Michael reactions from the eNovalys database (originally from patent literature).

Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Mercks drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.

Thus, some of the major scourges of this cyber society are paedophile behaviours on the Internet, child pornography or sexual exploitation of children. In light of this background, Negobot is a conversational agent posing as a child, in chats, social networks and other channels suffering from paedophile behaviour. As a conversational agent, Negobot, has a strong technical base of Natural Language Processing and information retrieval, as well as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, the most innovative proposal of Negobot is to consider the conversation itself as a game, applying game theory. In this context, Negobot proposes, first, a competitive game in which the system identifies the best strategies for achieving its goal, to obtain information that leads us to infer if the subject involved in a conversation with the agent has paedophile tendencies, while our actions do not bring the alleged offender to leave the conversation due to a suspicious behaviour of the agent.

J	Choras, M; Kozik, R				Choras, Michal; Kozik, Rafal			Machine learning techniques applied to detect cyber attacks on web applications	LOGIC JOURNAL OF THE IGPL			English	Article						Cyber attacks detection; cyber security; application layer; anomaly detection		The increased usage of cloud services, growing number of web applications users, changes in network infrastructure that connects devices running mobile operating systems and constantly evolving network technology cause novel challenges for cyber security. As a result, to counter arising threats, network security mechanisms, sensors and protection schemes also have to evolve, to address the needs and problems of the users. In this article, we focus on countering emerging application layer cyber attacks since those are listed as top threats and the main challenge for network and cyber security. The major contribution of the article is the proposition of machine learning approach to model normal behaviour of application and to detect cyber attacks. The model consists of patterns (in form of Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) regular expressions) that are obtained using graph-based segmentation technique and dynamic programming. The model is based on information obtained from HTTP requests generated by client to a web server. We have evaluated our method on CSIC 2010 HTTP Dataset achieving satisfactory results.

The main problem of systems using hyperspectral imaging is the cost of labelling, because it requires the domain experts, who label the region or prepare the labelled learning set for machine learning methods. The article presents a novel Hyperspectral Segmentation Algorithm which is a part of a general framework used for image classification. The algorithm is based on an image decomposition into homogeneous regions using a novel similarity measure. Three different region representations are proposed using the matrix notation. An additional procedure merges similar regions into larger ones to reduce human expert engagement in region labelling. The algorithm has been evaluated on the number of benchmark datasets to investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the final performance. Comparison with competing methods proved that the considered algorithm is an interesting proposition in hyperspectral image analysis tasks.

Improving AutoDock Vina Using Random Forest: The Growing Accuracy of Binding Affinity Prediction by the Effective Exploitation of Larger Data Sets	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article						Docking; Drug lead optimization; Machine learning	PROTEIN-LIGAND INTERACTIONS; EMPIRICAL SCORING FUNCTION; OUT CROSS-VALIDATION; MOLECULAR DOCKING; AUTOMATED DOCKING; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DRUG DISCOVERY; COMPLEXES; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION	There is a growing body of evidence showing that machine learning regression results in more accurate structure-based prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity. Docking methods that aim at optimizing the affinity of ligands for a target rely on how accurate their predicted ranking is. However, despite their proven advantages, machine-learning scoring functions are still not widely applied. This seems to be due to insufficient understanding of their properties and the lack of user-friendly software implementing them. Here we present a study where the accuracy of AutoDock Vina, arguably the most commonly-used docking software, is strongly improved by following a machine learning approach. We also analyse the factors that are responsible for this improvement and their generality. Most importantly, with the help of a proposed benchmark, we demonstrate that this improvement will be larger as more data becomes available for training Random Forest models, as regression models implying additive functional forms do not improve with more training data. We discuss how the latter opens the door to new opportunities in scoring function development. In order to facilitate the translation of this advance to enhance structure-based molecular design, we provide software to directly re-score Vina-generated poses and thus strongly improve their predicted binding affinity.

Depending on the specific applications, different SVM strategies can be used. For example, in the context of potency-directed virtual screening, linear combinations of multiple SVM models have been shown to enrich database selection sets with potent compounds compared to individual models. An open question concerning the use of SVM linear combinations (SVM-LCs) is how to best weight the models on a relative scale. Typically, linear weights are subjectively set. Herein, preferred weighting factors for SVM-LC were systematically determined. Therefore, weights were treated as meta-parameters and optimized by machine learning to enrich data set rankings with highly active compounds. The meta-parameter approach has been applied to 10 screening data sets and found to further improve SVM performance over other SVM-LCs and support vector regression (SVR) models. The results show that optimal weights depend on data set characteristics and chosen molecular representations. In addition, individual models often do not contribute to the performance of SVM-LCs. Taken together, these findings emphasize the need for systematic meta-parameter estimation.

The approach has low computational complexity, is primarily designed for hit expansion from biological screening data, and accurately predicts both active and inactive compounds. Its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as support vector machines or Bayesian classification. Matrix-based activity prediction of virtual compounds further extends the spectrum of computational methods for compound design.

Serotonin 5-HT6 binding and dopamine antagonism were investigated in separate studies. A set of 5-HT6 binders and non-binders was retrieved from the PDSP K-i database, whereas dopamine antagonists were retrieved from the MeSH Pharmaceutical Action file. The side effect data was extracted from ChemoText, a data repository containing MeSH annotations pulled from MEDLINE records. These side effects profiles were treated as molecular descriptors enabling a QSAR-like approach to build models that could reliably discriminate different classes of molecules, e.g., binders versus non-binders, and dopamine antagonists versus non-antagonists. Selected models with the best external prediction performances were applied to a library of ca. 1000 chemicals with known side effects profiles in order to predict their potential 5-HT6 binding and/or dopamine antagonism. In each case the virtual screening process was able to identify putatively active compounds that through subsequent literature-based validation were found to be likely or known 5-HT6 binders or dopamine antagonists. These results demonstrate that side effect profiles can be utilized to predict a drug's unknown molecular activity, thus representing a valuable opportunity in repositioning the drug for a new indications.

Improving image contrast and material discrimination with nonlinear response in bimodal atomic force microscopy	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MODE; CANTILEVERS; RESOLUTION; ENERGY; AFM	Atomic force microscopy has recently been extented to bimodal operation, where increased image contrast is achieved through excitation and measurement of two cantilever eigen-modes. This enhanced material contrast is advantageous in analysis of complex heterogeneous materials with phase separation on the micro or nanometre scale. Here we show that much greater image contrast results from analysis of nonlinear response to the bimodal drive, at harmonics and mixing frequencies. The amplitude and phase of up to 17 frequencies are simultaneously measured in a single scan. Using a machine-learning algorithm we demonstrate almost threefold improvement in the ability to separate material components of a polymer blend when including this nonlinear response. Beyond the statistical analysis performed here, analysis of nonlinear response could be used to obtain quantitative material properties at high speeds and with enhanced resolution.

ELM aims to break the barriers between the conventional artificial learning techniques and biological learning mechanism and represents a suite of machine learning techniques in which hidden neurons need not to be tuned. ELM theories and algorithms argue that "random hidden neurons" capture the essence of some brain learning mechanisms as well as the intuitive sense that the efficiency of brain learning need not rely on computing power of neurons. Thus, compared with traditional neural networks and support vector machine, ELM offers significant advantages such as fast learning speed, ease of implementation, and minimal human intervention. Due to its remarkable generalization performance and implementation efficiency, ELM has been applied in various applications. In this paper, we first provide an overview of newly derived ELM theories and approaches. On the other hand, with the ongoing development of multilayer feature representation, some new trends on ELM-based hierarchical learning are discussed. Moreover, we also present several interesting ELM applications to showcase the practical advances on this subject.

We also include in this benchmark a simple linear autoregressive (AR) model as well as two naive models based on persistence of the GHI and persistence of the clear sky index (denoted herein scaled persistence model). The models are calibrated and validated with data from three French islands: Corsica (41.91 degrees N; 8.73 degrees E), Guadeloupe (16.26 degrees N; 61.51 degrees W) and Reunion (21.34 degrees S; 55.49 degrees E). The main findings of this work are, that for hour ahead solar forecasting, the machine learning techniques slightly improve the performances exhibited by the linear AR and the scaled persistence model. However, the improvement appears to be more pronounced in case of unstable sky conditions. These nonlinear techniques start to outperform their simple counterparts for forecasting horizons greater than 1 h. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cattle collar data was collected at the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture (TIA) Dairy Research Facility in Tasmania. In the first stage of analysis a novel hybrid unsupervised clustering framework, comprised of probabilistic principal component analysis, Fuzzy C Means, and Self Organizing Map network algorithms was developed and used to study the natural structure of the sensor data. Findings from this unsupervised clustering were used to guide the next stage of supervised machine learning. Five major behaviour classes, namely, Grazing, Ruminating, Resting, Walking, and other behaviour were identified for the classification trials. An ensemble of classifiers approach was used to learn models of cow behaviour using sensor data and ground truth behaviour observations acquired from the field. Ensemble classification using bagging, Random Subspace and AdaBoost methods along with conventional supervised classification methods, namely, Binary Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, k-Nearest Neighbour classifier, and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System classifier were compared. The highest average correct classification accuracy of 96% was achieved using the bagging ensemble classification with Tree learner, which had 97% sensitivity, 89% specificity, 89% F1 score and 9% false discovery rate. This study has shown that cattle behaviours can be classified with a high accuracy using supervised machine learning technique. As dairy and beef systems become more intensive, the ability to identify the changes in the behaviours of individual livestock becomes increasingly difficult. Accurate behavioural monitoring through sensors provides a significant potential in providing a mechanism for the early detection and quantitative assessment of animal health issues such a lameness, informing key management events such as the identification of oestrus, or informing changes in supplementary feeding requirements.

Machine learning techniques have capabilities to analyse large biological data for detection of hidden pattern in understanding complex underlying biological problems. Presently, development of resistance to chemical antibiotics in cattle is unsolved and growing problem which needs immediate attention. In the present study, attempt was made to apply machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was found that performance of SVM based models for in silico prediction/identification of AMPs of cattle is superior than ANN. A total of 99 AMPs related to cattle collected from various databases and published literature were taken for this study. N-terminus residues, C-terminus residues and full sequences were used for model development and identification/prediction. It was found that best SVM models in this case for C-terminus residues, N-terminus residues and full sequence were with kernels Radial Basis Function (RBF), Sigmoid and RBF with accuracy as 95%, 99% and 97%, respectively. These SVM models were implemented on web server and made available to users at http://cabin.iasri.res.in/amp/ for classification/prediction of novel AMPs of cattle. This computational server can accelerate novel AMP discovery from whole genome proteins of a given cattle species for bulk discovery with very high accuracy.

An overnight audio recording of an individual subject is the preliminary and essential material for further study and diagnosis. Automatic detection, segmentation and classification of SRS from overnight audio recordings are significant in establishing a personal health database and in researching the area on a large scale. In this study, the authors focused on how to implement this intelligent method by combining acoustic signal processing with machine learning techniques. The authors proposed a systematic solution includes SRS events detection, classifier training, automatic segmentation and classification. An overnight audio recording of a severe OSAHS patient is taken as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of their method. Both the experimental data testing and subjective testing of 25 volunteers (17 males and 8 females) demonstrated that their method could be effective in automatic detection, segmentation and classification of the SRS from original audio recordings.

Materials and Methods: The EMD is used to extract features from intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). A machine-learning algorithm is used as a classifier to discriminate between seizure and nonseizure intracranial EEG epochs. A postprocessing algorithm is proposed to reject artifacts and increase the robustness of the method. The proposed method was evaluated using 463 hours of intracranial EEG recordings from 17 patients with a total of 51 seizures in the Freiburg EEG database. Results: The proposed method had better performance than most of the existing seizure detection systems, including an average sensitivity of 92%, false detection rate (FDR) of 0.17/hour, and time delay (TD) of 12 sec. Moreover, the FDR could be further reduced by a TD extension. Conclusions: Given its high sensitivity and low FDR, the proposed patient-specific seizure detection method can greatly assist clinical staff with automatically marking seizures in long-term EEG or detecting seizure onset online with high performance. Early and accurate seizure detection using this method may serve as a practical tool for planning epilepsy interventions.

MR volumetric assessment of endolymphatic hydrops	EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Meniere's disease; Endolymphatic hydrops; Magnetic resonance imaging; Drug administration routes; Image analysis	MENIERES-DISEASE CORRELATION; SINGLE-DOSE GADODIAMIDE; INNER-EAR; CALORIC RESPONSE; SPIN-ECHO; VISUALIZATION; GADOLINIUM; INJECTION; SPACE; BINARIZATION	Objectives We aimed to volumetrically quantify endolymph and perilymph spaces of the inner ear in order to establish a methodological basis for further investigations into the pathophysiology and therapeutic monitoring of Meniere's disease. Methods Sixteen patients (eight females, aged 38-71 years) with definite unilateral Meniere's disease were included in this study. Magnetic resonance (MR) cisternography with a T2-SPACE sequence was combined with a Real reconstruction inversion recovery (Real-IR) sequence for delineation of inner ear fluid spaces. Machine learning and automated local thresholding segmentation algorithms were applied for three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and volumetric quantification of endolymphatic hydrops. Test-retest reliability was assessed by the intra-class coefficient; correlation of cochlear endolymph volume ratio with hearing function was assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Endolymph volume ratios could be reliably measured in all patients, with a mean (range) value of 15 % (2-25) for the cochlea and 28 % (12-40) for the vestibulum. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with an intra-class coefficient of 0.99. Cochlear endolymphatic hydrops was significantly correlated with hearing loss (r=0.747, p=0.001). Conclusions MR imaging after local contrast application and image processing, including machine learning and automated local thresholding, enable the volumetric quantification of endolymphatic hydrops. This allows for a quantitative assessment of the effect of therapeutic interventions on endolymphatic hydrops.

We study through inter-annotator agreement and natural language processing (NLP) algorithm development the task of pairing measurements that quantify the same finding across consecutive radiology reports, such that each measurement is paired with at most one other ("partial uniqueness"). Methods and materials: Ground truth is created based on 283 abdomen and 311 chest CT reports of 50 patients each. A pre-processing engine segments reports and extracts measurements. Thirteen features are developed based on volumetric similarity between measurements, semantic similarity between their respective narrative contexts and structural properties of their report positions. A Random Forest classifier (RF) integrates all features. A "mutual best match" (MBM) post-processor ensures partial uniqueness. Results: In an end-to-end evaluation, RF has precision 0.841, recall 0.807, F-measure 0.824 and AUC 0.971; with MBM, which performs above chance level (P < 0.001), it has precision 0.899, recall 0.776, F-measure 0.833 and AUC 0.935. RF (RF + MBM) has error-free performance on 52.7% (57.4%) of report pairs. Discussion: Inter-annotator agreement of three domain specialists with the ground truth (kappa > 0.960) indicates that the task is well defined. Domain properties and inter-section differences are discussed to explain superior performance in abdomen. Enforcing partial uniqueness has mixed but minor effects on performance. Conclusion: A combined machine learning-filtering approach is proposed for pairing measurements, which can support prospective (supporting treatment response assessment) and retrospective purposes (data mining).

Quantifying the determinants of outbreak detection performance through simulation and machine learning	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Disease outbreak detection; Surveillance; Bayesian networks; Predicting performance; Public health informatics; Outbreak simulation	SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE; DETECTION ALGORITHMS; DISEASES	Objective: To develop a probabilistic model for discovering and quantifying determinants of outbreak detection and to use the model to predict detection performance for new outbreaks. Materials and methods: We used an existing software platform to simulate waterborne disease outbreaks of varying duration and magnitude. The simulated data were overlaid on real data from visits to emergency department in Montreal for gastroenteritis. We analyzed the combined data using biosurveillance algorithms, varying their parameters over a wide range. We then applied structure and parameter learning algorithms to the resulting data set to build a Bayesian network model for predicting detection performance as a function of outbreak characteristics and surveillance system parameters. We evaluated the predictions of this model through 5-fold cross-validation. Results: The model predicted performance metrics of commonly used outbreak detection methods with an accuracy greater than 0.80. The model also quantified the influence of different outbreak characteristics and parameters of biosurveillance algorithms on detection performance in practically relevant surveillance scenarios. In addition to identifying characteristics expected a priori to have a strong influence on detection performance, such as the alerting threshold and the peak size of the outbreak, the model suggested an important role for other algorithm features, such as adjustment for weekly patterns. Conclusion: We developed a model that accurately predicts how characteristics of disease outbreaks and detection methods will influence on detection. This model can be used to compare the performance of detection methods under different surveillance scenarios, to gain insight into which characteristics of outbreaks and biosurveillance algorithms drive detection performance, and to guide the configuration of surveillance systems.

J	Sarker, A; Gonzalez, G				Sarker, Abeed; Gonzalez, Graciela			Portable automatic text classification for adverse drug reaction detection via multi-corpus training	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Pharmacovigilance; Adverse drug reaction; Social media monitoring; Text classification; Natural language processing	SOCIAL MEDIA; SUPPORT; SAFETY	Objective: Automatic detection of adverse drug reaction (ADR) mentions from text has recently received significant interest in pharmacovigilance research. Current research focuses on various sources of text-based information, including social media where enormous amounts of user posted data is available, which have the potential for use in pharmacovigilance if collected and filtered accurately. The aims of this study are: (i) to explore natural language processing (NLP) approaches for generating useful features from text, and utilizing them in optimized machine learning algorithms for automatic classification of ADR assertive text segments; (ii) to present two data sets that we prepared for the task of ADR detection from user posted intemet data; and (iii) to investigate if combining training data from distinct corpora can improve automatic classification accuracies. Methods: One of our three data sets contains annotated sentences from clinical reports, and the two other data sets, built in-house, consist of annotated posts from social media. Our text classification approach relies on generating a large set of features, representing semantic properties (e.g., sentiment, polarity, and topic), from short text nuggets. Importantly, using our expanded feature sets, we combine training data from different corpora in attempts to boost classification accuracies. Results: Our feature-rich classification approach performs significantly better than previously published approaches with ADR class F-scores of 0.812 (previously reported best: 0.770), 0.538 and 0.678 for the three data sets. Combining training data from multiple compatible corpora further improves the ADR F-scores for the in-house data sets to 0.597 (improvement of 5.9 units) and 0.704 (improvement of 2.6 units) respectively. Conclusions: Our research results indicate that using advanced NLP techniques for generating information rich features from text can significantly improve classification accuracies over existing benchmarks. Our experiments illustrate the benefits of incorporating various semantic features such as topics, concepts, sentiments, and polarities. Finally, we show that integration of information from compatible corpora can significantly improve classification performance. This form of multi-corpus training may be particularly useful in cases where data sets are heavily imbalanced (e.g., social media data), and may reduce the time and costs associated with the annotation of data in the future.

Incorporating temporal EHR data in predictive models for risk stratification of renal function deterioration	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electronic health records; Temporal analysis; Progression of kidney function loss; Risk stratification	CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; CKD; ESRD; FAILURE	Predictive models built using temporal data in electronic health records (EHRs) can potentially play a major role in improving management of chronic diseases. However, these data present a multitude of technical challenges, including irregular sampling of data and varying length of available patient history. In this paper, we describe and evaluate three different approaches that use machine learning to build predictive models using temporal EHR data of a patient. The first approach is a commonly used non-temporal approach that aggregates values of the predictors in the patient's medical history. The other two approaches exploit the temporal dynamics of the data. The two temporal approaches vary in how they model temporal information and handle missing data. Using data from the EHR of Mount Sinai Medical Center, we learned and evaluated the models in the context of predicting loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the most common assessment of kidney function. Our results show that incorporating temporal information in patient's medical history can lead to better prediction of loss of kidney function. They also demonstrate that exactly how this information is incorporated is important. In particular, our results demonstrate that the relative importance of different predictors varies over time, and that using multi-task learning to account for this is an appropriate way to robustly capture the temporal dynamics in EHR data. Using a case study, we also demonstrate how the multi-task learning based model can yield predictive models with better performance for identifying patients at high risk of short-term loss of kidney function.

Surveillance of the more diagnostically challenging invasive fungal diseases, specifically of the sino-pulmonary system, is not feasible for many hospitals because case finding is a costly and labour intensive exercise. We developed text classifiers for detecting such IFDs from free-text radiology (CT) reports, using machine-learning techniques. Method: We obtained free-text reports of CT scans performed over a specific hospitalisation period (2003-2011), for 264 IFD and 289 control patients from three tertiary hospitals. We analysed IFD evidence at patient, report, and sentence levels. Three infectious disease experts annotated the reports of 73 IFD-positive patients for language suggestive of IFD at sentence level, and graded the sentences as to whether they suggested or excluded the presence of IFD. Reliable agreement between annotators was obtained and this was used as training data for our classifiers. We tested a variety of Machine Learning (ML), rule based, and hybrid systems, with feature types including bags of words, bags of phrases, and bags of concepts, as well as report-level structured features. Evaluation was carried out over a robust framework with separate Development and Held-Out datasets. Results: The best systems (using Support Vector Machines) achieved very high recall at report- and patient-levels over unseen data: 95% and 100% respectively. Precision at report-level over held-out data was 71%; however, most of the associated false-positive reports (53%) belonged to patients who had a previous positive report appropriately flagged by the classifier, reducing negative impact in practice. Conclusions: Our machine learning application holds the potential for developing systematic IFD surveillance systems for hospital populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Yepes, AJ; Berlanga, R				Yepes, Antonio Jimeno; Berlanga, Rafael			Knowledge based word-concept model estimation and refinement for biomedical text mining	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Word-concept probability; Text mining; Word sense disambiguation; Information retrieval; Biomedical literature	SENSE DISAMBIGUATION; GENE ONTOLOGY; ALGORITHM; DOMAIN	Text mining of scientific literature has been essential for setting up large public biomedical databases, which are being widely used by the research community. In the biomedical domain, the existence of a large number of terminological resources and knowledge bases (KB) has enabled a myriad of machine learning methods for different text mining related tasks. Unfortunately, KBs have not been devised for text mining tasks but for human interpretation, thus performance of KB-based methods is usually lower when compared to supervised machine learning methods. The disadvantage of supervised methods though is they require labeled training data and therefore not useful for large scale biomedical text mining systems. KB-based methods do not have this limitation. In this paper, we describe a novel method to generate word-concept probabilities from a KB, which can serve as a basis for several text mining tasks. This method not only takes into account the underlying patterns within the descriptions contained in the KB but also those in texts available from large unlabeled corpora such as MEDLINE. The parameters of the model have been estimated without training data. Patterns from MEDLINE have been built using MetaMap for entity recognition and related using co-occurrences. The word-concept probabilities were evaluated on the task of word sense disambiguation (WSD). The results showed that our method obtained a higher degree of accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches when evaluated on the MSH WSD data set. We also evaluated our method on the task of document ranking using MEDLINE citations. These results also showed an increase in performance over existing baseline retrieval approaches.

J	Kim, S; Yoon, J				Kim, Seonho; Yoon, Juntae			Link-topic model for biomedical abbreviation disambiguation	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Topic model; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Biomedical abbreviation disambiguation; Semantic link; Global abbreviation	WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION; MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH; INFORMATION; ACRONYMS; DATABASE; MEDLINE; UMLS	Introduction: The ambiguity of biomedical abbreviations is one of the challenges in biomedical text mining systems. In particular, the handling of term variants and abbreviations without nearby definitions is a critical issue. In this study, we adopt the concepts of topic of document and word link to disambiguate biomedical abbreviations. Methods: We newly suggest the link topic model inspired by the latent Dirichlet allocation model, in which each document is perceived as a random mixture of topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. Thus, the most probable expansions with respect to abbreviations of a given abstract are determined by word-topic, document-topic, and word-link distributions estimated from a document collection through the link topic model. The model allows two distinct modes of word generation to incorporate semantic dependencies among words, particularly long form words of abbreviations and their sentential co-occurring words; a word can be generated either dependently on the long form of the abbreviation or independently. The semantic dependency between two words is defined as a link and a new random parameter for the link is assigned to each word as well as a topic parameter. Because the link status indicates whether the word constitutes a link with a given specific long form, it has the effect of determining whether a word forms a unigram or a skipping/consecutive bigram with respect to the long form. Furthermore, we place a constraint on the model so that a word has the same topic as a specific long form if it is generated in reference to the long form. Consequently, documents are generated from the two hidden parameters, i.e. topic and link, and the most probable expansion of a specific abbreviation is estimated from the parameters. Results: Our model relaxes the bag-of-words assumption of the standard topic model in which the word order is neglected, and it captures a richer structure of text than does the standard topic model by considering unigrams and semantically associated bigrams simultaneously. The addition of semantic links improves the disambiguation accuracy without removing irrelevant contextual words and reduces the parameter space of massive skipping or consecutive bigrams. The link topic model achieves 98.42% disambiguation accuracy on 73,505 MEDLINE abstracts with respect to 21 three letter abbreviations and their 139 distinct long forms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Functional error modeling for uncertainty quantification in hydrogeology	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						machine learning; proxy model	RESERVOIR; SIMULATION; DISTANCES; ROTATION	Approximate models (proxies) can be employed to reduce the computational costs of estimating uncertainty. The price to pay is that the approximations introduced by the proxy model can lead to a biased estimation. To avoid this problem and ensure a reliable uncertainty quantification, we propose to combine functional data analysis and machine learning to build error models that allow us to obtain an accurate prediction of the exact response without solving the exact model for all realizations. We build the relationship between proxy and exact model on a learning set of geostatistical realizations for which both exact and approximate solvers are run. Functional principal components analysis (FPCA) is used to investigate the variability in the two sets of curves and reduce the dimensionality of the problem while maximizing the retained information. Once obtained, the error model can be used to predict the exact response of any realization on the basis of the sole proxy response. This methodology is purpose-oriented as the error model is constructed directly for the quantity of interest, rather than for the state of the system. Also, the dimensionality reduction performed by FPCA allows a diagnostic of the quality of the error model to assess the informativeness of the learning set and the fidelity of the proxy to the exact model. The possibility of obtaining a prediction of the exact response for any newly generated realization suggests that the methodology can be effectively used beyond the context of uncertainty quantification, in particular for Bayesian inference and optimization.

A data-driven approach to develop physically sound predictors: Application to depth-averaged velocities on flows through submerged arrays of rigid cylinders	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						genetic programming; machine learning; vegetation resistance; open-channel flow	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MULTIVARIATE WAVE CLIMATE; OPEN-CHANNEL FLOWS; VEGETATION; RESISTANCE; DRAG	We use a machine learning approach to seek an accurate, physically sound predictor, to estimate the mean velocity for open-channel flow when submerged arrays of rigid cylinders (model vegetation) are present. A genetic programming routine is used to find a robust relationship between relevant properties of the model vegetation and flow parameters. We use published data from laboratory experiments covering a broad range of conditions to obtain an equation that matches the performance of other predictors from recent literature in terms of accuracy, while showing a less complex structure. We also investigate how different criteria for data selection, as well as the size of the data set used to train the algorithm, influences the accuracy of the resulting predictors. Our results show that a proper use of Machine-Learning techniques does not only provide empirical correlations, but can yield physically sound models as representative of the physical processes involved. We provide a clear, thorough example of the application of GP, its advantages and shortcomings, to encourage the use of data-driven techniques as part of the data analysis process, and to address common misconceptions of machine learning as simple correlation techniques or physically senseless statistical analysis.

FCUBE exploits data parallelism in lieu of algorithmic parallelization to allow its users to efficiently tackle large data problems automatically. It passes random subsets of data generated via resampling to multiple learners that it executes simultaneously and then it combines their model predictions with a simple fusion technique. It is an example of what we have named a Bring Your Own Learner model. It allows multiple machine learning researchers to contribute algorithms in a plug-and-play style. We contend that the Bring Your Own Learner model signals a design shift in cloud-based machine learning infrastructure because it is capable of executing anyone's supervised machine learning algorithm. We demonstrate FCUBE executing five different learners contributed by three different machine learning groups on a 100 node deployment on Amazon EC2. They collectively solve a publicly available classification problem trained with 11 million exemplars from the Higgs dataset.

The proposed super-resolution algorithm entails a two dimensional polynomial regression method using only the input image properties for the learning task. Model selection is applied for defining the optimal degree of polynomial by adopting regularization capability in order to avoid overfitting. Although it is widely believed that machine learning algorithms are not appropriate for real-time implementation, the paper in hand proves that there are indeed specific hypothesis representations that are able to be integrated into real-time mobile applications. With aim to achieve this goal, the increasing GPU employment in modern mobile devices is exploited. More precisely, by utilizing the mobile GPU as a co-processor in a hybrid pipelined implementation, significant performance speedup along with superior quantitative results can be achieved.(1).

Our aim was to test the applicability of different image classification methods of hyperspectral data in this complex situation. To reach the highest classification accuracy, we tested traditional image classifiers (maximum likelihood classifier-MLC), machine learning algorithms (support vector machine-SVM, random forest-RF) and feature extraction (minimum noise fraction (MNF)-transformation) on training datasets of different sizes. Digital images were acquired from an AISA EAGLE II hyperspectral sensor of 128 contiguous bands (400-1000 nm), a spectral sampling of 5 nm bandwidth and a ground pixel size of 1 m. For the classification, we established twenty vegetation classes based on the dominant species, canopy height, and total vegetation cover. Image classification was applied to the original and MNF (minimum noise fraction) transformed dataset with various training sample sizes between 10 and 30 pixels. In order to select the optimal number of the transformed features, we applied SVM, RF and MLC classification to 2-15 MNF transformed bands. In the case of the original bands, SVM and RF classifiers provided high accuracy irrespective of the number of the training pixels. We found that SVM and RF produced the best accuracy when using the first nine MNF transformed bands; involving further features did not increase classification accuracy. SVM and RF provided high accuracies with the transformed bands, especially in the case of the aggregated groups. Even MLC provided high accuracy with 30 training pixels (80.78%), but the use of a smaller training dataset (10 training pixels) significantly reduced the accuracy of classification (52.56%). Our results suggest that in alkali landscapes, the application of SVM is a feasible solution, as it provided the highest accuracies compared to RF and MLC. SVM was not sensitive in the training sample size, which makes it an adequate tool when only a limited number of training pixels are available for some classes.

Improving the Ensemble-Optimization Method Through Covariance-Matrix Adaptation	SPE JOURNAL			English	Article							BRUGGE FIELD	Ensemble optimization (referred to throughout the remainder of the paper as EnOpt) is a rapidly emerging method for reservoir-model- based production optimization. EnOpt uses an ensemble of controls to approximate the gradient of the objective function with respect to the controls. Current implementations of EnOpt use a Gaussian ensemble of control perturbations with a constant covariance matrix, and thus a constant perturbation size, during the entire optimization process. The covariance-matrix-adaptation evolutionary strategy is a gradient-free optimization method developed in the "machine learning" community, which also uses an ensemble of controls, but with a covariance matrix that is continually updated during the optimization process. It was shown to be an efficient method for several difficult but small-dimensional optimization problems and was recently applied in the petroleum industry for well location and production optimization. In this study, we investigate the scope to improve the computational efficiency of EnOpt through the use of covariance-matrix adaptation (referred to throughout the remainder of the paper as CMA-EnOpt). The resulting method is applied to the waterflooding optimization of a small multilayer test model and a modified version of the Brugge benchmark model. The controls used are inflow-control-valve settings at predefined time intervals for injectors and producers with undiscounted net present value as the objective function. We compare EnOpt and CMA-EnOpt starting from identical covariance matrices. For the small model, we achieve only slightly higher (0.7 to 1.8%) objective-function values and modest speedups with CMA-EnOpt compared with EnOpt. Significantly higher objective-function values (10%) are obtained for the modified Brugge model. The possibility to adapt the covariance matrix, and thus the perturbation size, during the optimization allows for the use of relatively large perturbations initially, for fast exploration of the control space, and small perturbations later, for more-precise gradients near the optimum. Moreover, the results demonstrate that a major benefit of CMA-EnOpt is its robustness with respect to the initial choice of the covariance matrix. A poor choice of the initial matrix can be detrimental to EnOpt, whereas the CMA-EnOpt performance is near-independent of the initial choice and produces higher objective-function values at no additional computational cost.

In recent years, SVM was adapted to the field of High Performance Computing for power/performance prediction, auto-tuning, and runtime scheduling. However, even at the risk of losing prediction accuracy due to insufficient runtime information, researchers can only afford to apply offline model training to avoid significant runtime training overhead. Advanced multi- and many-core architectures offer massive parallelism with complex memory hierarchies which can make runtime training possible, but form a barrier to efficient parallel SVM design. To address the challenges above, we designed and implemented MIC-SVM, a highly efficient parallel SVM for x86 based multi-core and many-core architectures, such as the Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi co-processor (MIC). We propose various novel analysis methods and optimization techniques to fully utilize the multilevel parallelism provided by these architectures and serve as general optimization methods for other machine learning tools. MIC-SVM achieves 4.4-84x and 18-47x speedups against the popular LIBSVM, on MIC and Ivy Bridge CPUs respectively, for several real-world data-mining datasets. Even compared with GPUSVM, running on the NVIDIA k20x GPU, the performance of our MIC-SVM is competitive. We also conduct a cross-platform performance comparison analysis, focusing on Ivy Bridge CPUs, MIC and GPUs, and provide insights on how to select the most suitable advanced architectures for specific algorithms and input data patterns.

The model is trained for cloud detection on MSG SEVIRI daytime data. It consists of a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden sigmoid layer, trained with the error back-propagation algorithm. The model is fed by six bands of MSG data (0.6, 0.8, 1.6, 3.9, 6.2 and 10.8 mu m) with 10 hidden nodes. The multiple-layer perceptrons lead to a cloud detection accuracy of 88.96%, when trained to map two predefined values that classify cloud and clear sky. The network was further evaluated using sixty MSG images taken at different dates. The network detected not only bright thick clouds but also thin or less bright clouds. The analysis demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning models of cloud detection in MSG SEVIRI imagery.

A challenge faced by both human learners and machine learning algorithms is identifying subsequences that correspond to the appropriate variables for causal inference. A specific instance of this problem is action segmentation: dividing a sequence of observed behavior into meaningful actions, and determining which of those actions lead to effects in the world. Here we present a Bayesian analysis of how statistical and causal cues to segmentation should optimally be combined, as well as four experiments investigating human action segmentation and causal inference. We find that both people and our model are sensitive to statistical regularities and causal structure in continuous action, and are able to combine these sources of information in order to correctly infer both causal relationships and segmentation boundaries.

In continuous cardiac monitoring using wireless Body Sensor Networks (BSNs), the quality of ECG signals can be deteriorated owing to several factors, e.g., noises, low battery power, and network transmission problems, often resulting in high false alarm rates. In addition, body movements occurring from activities of daily living (ADLs) can also create false alarms. This paper presents a two-phase framework for false arrhythmia alarm reduction in continuous cardiac monitoring, using signals from an ECG sensor and a 3D accelerometer. In the first phase, classification models constructed using machine learning algorithms are used for labeling input signals. ECG signals are labeled with heartbeat types and signal quality levels, while 3D acceleration signals are labeled with ADL types. In the second phase, a rule-based expert system is used for combining classification results in order to determine whether arrhythmia alarms should be accepted or suppressed. The proposed framework was validated on datasets acquired using BSNs and the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. For the BSN dataset, acceleration and ECG signals were collected from 10 young and 10 elderly subjects while they were performing ADLs. The framework reduced the false alarm rate from 9.58% to 1.43% in our experimental study, showing that it can potentially assist physicians in diagnosing a vast amount of data acquired from wireless sensors and enhance the performance of continuous cardiac monitoring.

First, the machine learning algorithm of OpenCV was used to extract location information from SEM images. Thus nanowires and probe in SEM images can be automatically tracked and the region of interest (ROI) can be marked quickly. Then the location of nanowire and probe can be extracted from the ROI. To study the probe operation strategy, the Van der Waals force between probe and a nanowire was computed; thus relevant operating parameters can be obtained. With these operating parameters, the nanowire in 3D virtual environment can be preoperated and an optimal path of the probe can be obtained. The actual probe runs automatically under the telenanomanipulation system's control. Finally, experiments were carried out to verify the above methods, and results show the designed methods have achieved the expected effect.

Fifty-six studies conducted between 2002 and 2012 were examined, to identify prominent themes and approaches. According to the content analysis, the new technological trends and approaches were grouped into seven categories: standardization, semantic web, modular frameworks, data mining, machine learning techniques, social web, and device adaptation. Furthermore, four challenges are suggested as explanation why adaptive systems are still not used on a large scale: inter-operability, open corpus knowledge, usage across a variety of delivery devices, and the design of meta-adaptive systems.

We developed an intelligent system using machine learning techniques that periodically detects a user's context on a smartphone. We selected the Android operating system because it has the largest market share and highest flexibility of its development environment. In this paper, we describe an application that automatically adjusts application volume. Adjusting the volume can be easily forgotten because users need to push the volume buttons to alter the volume depending on the given situation. Therefore, we developed an application that automatically adjusts the volume based on learned user settings. Application volume can be set differently from ringtone volume on Android devices, and these volume settings are associated with each specific application including games. Our application records a user's location, the volume setting, the foreground application name and other such attributes as learning data, thereby estimating whether the volume should be adjusted using machine learning techniques via Weka.

To achieve this, we present approaches, which use homology and statistical learning methods called "transfer learning." In the transfer learning setting, the task of predicting PPIs between Arabidopsis and its pathogen S. Typhimurium is called the "target task." The presented approaches utilize labeled data i.e., known PPIs of other host-pathogen pairs (we call these PPIs the "source tasks"). The homology based approaches use heuristics based on biological intuition to predict PPIs. The transfer learning methods use the similarity of the PPIs from the source tasks to the target task to build a model. For a quantitative evaluation we consider Salmonella-mouse PPI prediction and some other host-pathogen tasks where known PPIs exist. We use metrics such as precision and recall and our results show that our methods perform well on the target task in various transfer settings. We present a brief qualitative analysis of the Arabidopsis-Salmonella predicted interactions. We filter the predictions from all approaches using Gene Ontology term enrichment and only those interactions involving Salmonella effectors. Thereby we observe that Arabidopsis proteins involved e.g., in transcriptional regulation, hormone mediated signaling and defense response may be affected by Salmonella.

We investigate not only which is the best fusion approach, but also the correlation among the state-of-the-art matchers for fingerprint verification and scanner interoperability of the fusion techniques. Several tests are performed on all the four FVC2006 datasets, using a leave-one-out dataset testing protocol, i.e., the training phase is conducted on the datasets not used in the testing phase, so it is possible to study the pros and cons of machine learning and statistical approaches when different scanners are used in the training and testing phases. This work confirms that the fusion of different state-of-the-art fingerprint matchers can lead to a significant performance gain with respect to a single matcher. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jayadeva				Jayadeva			Learning a hyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact bound on the VC dimensioni	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Machine learning; Support vector machines; VC dimension; Complexity; Generalization; Sparse	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM	The VC dimension measures the complexity of a learning machine, and a low VC dimension leads to good generalization. While SVMs produce state-of-the-art learning performance, it is well known that the VC dimension of a SVM can be unbounded; despite good results in practice, there is no guarantee of good generalization. In this paper, we show how to learn a hyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact, or Theta bound on its VC dimension. The proposed approach, termed as the Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM), involves solving a simple linear programming problem. Experimental results show, that on a number of benchmark datasets, the proposed approach learns classifiers with error rates much less than conventional SVMs, while often using fewer support vectors. On many benchmark datasets, the number of support vectors is less than one-tenth the number used by SVMs, indicating that the MCM does indeed learn simpler representations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this paper is to present a survey of recent progress and advances in visual feature detection. Firstly we describe the relations among edges, corners and blobs from the psychological view. Secondly we classify the algorithms in detecting edges, corners and blobs into different categories and provide detailed descriptions for representative recent algorithms in each category. Considering that machine learning becomes more involved in visual feature detection, we put more emphasis on machine learning based feature detection methods. Thirdly, evaluation standards and databases are also introduced. Through this survey we would like to present the recent progress in visual feature detection and identify future trends as well as challenges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yoon, JW; Friel, N				Yoon, Ji Won; Friel, Nial			Efficient model selection for probabilistic K nearest neighbour classification	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Model averaging; K-free model order estimation	MONTE-CARLO METHODS; CHOICE; SYSTEMS; RULE	Probabilistic K-nearest neighbour (PKNN) classification has been introduced to improve the performance of the original K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classification algorithm by explicitly modelling uncertainty in the classification of each feature vector. However, an issue common to both KNN and PKNN is to select the optimal number of neighbours, K. The contribution of this paper is to incorporate the uncertainty in K into the decision making, and consequently to provide improved classification with Bayesian model averaging. Indeed the problem of assessing the uncertainty in K can be viewed as one of statistical model selection which is one of the most important technical issues in the statistics and machine learning domain. In this paper, we develop a new functional approximation algorithm to reconstruct the density of the model (order) without relying on time consuming Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, the algorithms avoid cross validation by adopting Bayesian framework. The performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated on several real experimental datasets.

With the rapid developments in genome sequencing technologies, the focus has shifted towards the sequencing of hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene instead of full length gene sequencing. Therefore, 16S Classifier is developed using a machine learning method, Random Forest, for faster and accurate taxonomic classification of short hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA sequence. It displayed precision values of up to 0.91 on training datasets and the precision values of up to 0.98 on the test dataset. On real metagenomic datasets, it showed up to 99.7% accuracy at the phylum level and up to 99.0% accuracy at the genus level. 16S Classifier is available freely at http://metagenomics.iiserb.ac.in/16Sclassifier and http://metabiosys.iiserb.ac.in/16Sclassifier.

We have developed a new computational tool, PON-P2, for classification of amino acid substitutions in human proteins. The method is a machine learning-based classifier and groups the variants into pathogenic, neutral and unknown classes, on the basis of random forest probability score. PON-P2 is trained using pathogenic and neutral variants obtained from VariBench, a database for benchmark variation datasets. PON-P2 utilizes information about evolutionary conservation of sequences, physical and biochemical properties of amino acids, GO annotations and if available, functional annotations of variation sites. Extensive feature selection was performed to identify 8 informative features among altogether 622 features. PON-P2 consistently showed superior performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art tools. In 10-fold cross-validation test, its accuracy and MCC are 0.90 and 0.80, respectively, and in the independent test, they are 0.86 and 0.71, respectively. The coverage of PON-P2 is 61.7% in the 10-fold cross-validation and 62.1% in the test dataset. PON-P2 is a powerful tool for screening harmful variants and for ranking and prioritizing experimental characterization. It is very fast making it capable of analyzing large variant datasets.

Differential co-expression network centrality and machine learning feature selection for identifying susceptibility hubs in networks with scale-free structure	BIODATA MINING			English	Article							ASSOCIATION INTERACTION NETWORK; GENE-EXPRESSION; PROTEIN NETWORKS; T-CELLS; MICROARRAY; INFLUENZA; EVOLUTION; HUMANS; DAMAGE; MODEL	Background: Biological insights into group differences, such as disease status, have been achieved through differential co-expression analysis of microarray data. Additional understanding of group differences may be achieved by integrating the connectivity structure of the differential co-expression network and per-gene differential expression between phenotypic groups. Such a global differential co-expression network strategy may increase sensitivity to detect gene-gene interactions (or expression epistasis) that may act as candidates for rewiring susceptibility co-expression networks. Methods: We test two methods for inferring Genetic Association Interaction Networks (GAIN) incorporating both differential co-expression effects and differential expression effects: a generalized linear model (GLM) regression method with interaction effects (reGAIN) and a Fisher test method for correlation differences (dcGAIN). We rank the importance of each gene with complete interaction network centrality (CINC), which integrates each gene's differential co-expression effects in the GAIN model along with each gene's individual differential expression measure. We compare these methods with statistical learning methods Relief-F, Random Forests and Lasso. We also develop a mixture model and permutation approach for determining significant importance score thresholds for network centralities, Relief-F and Random Forest. We introduce a novel simulation strategy that generates microarray case-control data with embedded differential co-expression networks and underlying correlation structure based on scale-free or Erdos-Renyi (ER) random networks. Results: Using the network simulation strategy, we find that Relief-F and reGAIN provide the best balance between detecting interactions and main effects, plus reGAIN has the ability to adjust for covariates and model quantitative traits. The dcGAIN approach performs best at finding differential co-expression effects by design but worst for main effects, and it does not adjust for covariates and is limited to dichotomous outcomes. When the underlying network is scale free instead of ER, all interaction network methods have greater power to find differential co-expression effects. We apply these methods to a public microarray study of the differential immune response to influenza vaccine, and we identify effects that suggest a role in influenza vaccine immune response for genes from the PI3K family, which includes genes with known immunodeficiency function, and KLRG1, which is a known marker of senescence.

J	Montalto, A; Tessitore, G; Prevete, R				Montalto, Alessandro; Tessitore, Giovanni; Prevete, Roberto			A linear approach for sparse coding by a two-layer neural network	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Neural networks; Sparse coding; Linear approach; Encoder-decoder	ALGORITHM	Many approaches to transform classification problems from non-linear to linear by feature transformation have been recently presented in the literature. These notably include sparse coding methods and deep neural networks. However, many of these approaches require the repeated application of a learning process upon the presentation of unseen data input vectors, or else involve the use of large numbers of parameters and hyper-parameters, which must be chosen through cross-validation, thus increasing running time dramatically. In this paper, we propose and experimentally investigate a new approach for the purpose of overcoming limitations of both kinds. The proposed approach makes use of a linear auto-associative network (called SCNN) with just one hidden layer. The combination of this architecture with a specific error function to be minimized enables one to learn a linear encoder computing a sparse code which turns out to be as similar as possible to the sparse coding that one obtains by re-training the neural network. Importantly, the linearity of SCNN and the choice of the error function allow one to achieve reduced running time in the learning phase. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the basis of two standard machine learning tasks. Its performances are compared with those of recently proposed non-linear auto-associative neural networks. The overall results suggest that linear encoders can be profitably used to obtain sparse data representations in the context of machine learning problems, provided that an appropriate error function is used during the learning phase.

When dealing with a number of visual features/cues in a system, it is always challenging to combine or fuse them. As there is no commonly agreed natural way of combining different conspicuity maps obtained from different features: face and motion for example, the challenge is thus to find the right mix of visual cues to get a salience map that is the closest to a corresponding gaze map? In the literature many CAMs have used fixed weights for combining different visual cues. This is computationally attractive but is a very crude way of combining the different cues. Furthermore, the weights are typically set in an ad hoc fashion. Therefore in this paper, we propose a machine learning approach, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to estimate these weights. The ANN is trained using gaze maps, obtained by eye tracking in psycho-physical experiments. These weights are then used to combine the conspicuities of the different visual cues in our CAM, which is later applied to surveillance videos. The proposed model is designed in a way to consider important visual cues typically present in surveillance videos, and to combine their conspicuities via ANN. The obtained results are encouraging and show a clear improvement over state-of-the-art CAMs. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Fully Complex-valued Fast Learning Classifier (FC-FLC) for real-valued classification problems	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Complex-valued neural network; Classification; Codermannian function; Circular transformation; Extreme learning machine	BASIS FUNCTION NETWORK; NEURAL-NETWORK; MULTIVALUED NEURONS; ALGORITHM; MACHINE	This paper presents a Fully Complex-valued Fast Learning Classifier (FC-FLC) to solve real-valued classification problems. FC-FLC is a single hidden layer network with a nonlinear input and hidden layer. and a linear output layer. The neurons at the input layer of the FC-FLC employ the circular transformation to convert the real-valued input features to the Complex domain. At the hidden layer, the complexvalued input features are projected onto a hyper-dimensional complex plane (Cm) using the K hidden neurons employing Gudermannian (Gd) activation function. To investigate the suitability of the Gd as an activation function for a fully complex-valued network, we formulate the activation function in two forms. The output layer is linear. The input weights of the FC-FLC are chosen randomly and the output weights are estimated analytically. The best input weights corresponding to the best generalization performance of the FC-FLC are obtained by a k-fold cross validation. The performance of the proposed classifier is evaluated in comparison to other complex-valued and a few best performing realvalued classifiers on a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository and a practical human emotion recognition problem. Statistical analysis is carried out to validate the performance of the classifier. Performance results show that FC-FLC has better classification ability than the other classifiers in the literature.

MapReduce is a simple, scalable and fault-tolerant data processing framework that enables us to process a massive volume of data. Many machine learning algorithms have been designed based on MapReduce, but there are only a few works related to parallel extreme learning machine (ELM) which is a fast and accurate learning algorithm. Online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is one of improved ELM algorithms to support online sequential learning efficiently. In this paper, we first analyze the dependency relationships of matrix calculations of OS-ELM, then propose a parallel online sequential extreme learning machine (POS-ELM) based on MapReduce. POS-ELM is evaluated with real and synthetic data with the maximum number of training data 1280 K and the maximum number of attributes 128. The experimental results show that the training accuracy and testing accuracy of POS-ELM are at the same level as those of OS-ELM and ELM, and it has good scalability with regard to the number of training data and the number of attributes. Compared to original ELM and OS-ELM where the capability to process large scale data is bounded by the limitation of resources within a single processing unit, POS-ELM can deal with much larger scale data. The larger the number of training data is, the higher the speedup of POS-ELM is. It can be concluded that POS-ELM has more powerful capability than both ELM and OS-ELM for large scale learning.

We present a new machine learning framework called "LARSEN-ELM" to overcome this problem. In our paper, we would like to show two key steps in LARSEN-ELM. In the first step, preprocessing, we select the input variables highly related to the output using least angle regression (LARS). In the second step, training, we employ Genetic Algorithm (GA) based selective ensemble and original ELM. In the experiments, we apply a sum of two sines and four datasets from UCI repository to verify the robustness of our approach. The experimental results show that compared with original ELM and other methods such as OP-ELM, GASEN-ELM and LSBoost, LARSEN-ELM significantly improves robustness performance while keeping a relatively high speed.

It is challenging because facial aging variation is specific to a given individual and is determined by the person's gene and many external factors, such as exposure, weather, gender, and living style. Age estimation is a multiclass problem and the number of classes to predict is quite large. There surely is facial aging trend and faces from closed age range have some similar facial aging features. It is difficult to say there are distinct facial aging features for an age. Facial aging features are found to be overlapped among nearby age groups along the aging life and are continuous in nature. In this paper, we emphasised our work on age range estimation with four pre-defined classes. We applied a fast and efficient machine learning method: extreme learning machines, to solve the age categorization problem. Local Gabor Binary Patterns, Biologically Inspired Feature and Gabor were adopted to represent face image. Age estimation was performed on three different aging datasets and experimental results are reported to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier ay. All rights reserved.

The empirical study shows that Li-ELM can achieve good generalization performance on the evaluation datasets, while preserving the fast learning and little human intervened advantages that ELM has.

We present a method able of accurately reproducing such interactions for seven van der Waals complexes. It uses atomic multipole moments up to hexadecupole moment mapped to the positions of the nuclear coordinates by the machine learning method kriging. Models were built at three levels of theory: HF/6-31C**, B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ and M06-2X/aug-cc-pVDZ. The quality of the kriging models was measured by their ability to predict the electrostatic interaction energy between atoms in external test examples for which the true energies are known. At all levels of theory, >90% of test cases for small van der Waals complexes were predicted within 1 kJ mol(-1), decreasing to 60-70% of test cases for larger base pair complexes. Models built on moments obtained at B3LYP and M06-2X level generally outperformed those at HF level. For all systems the individual interactions were predicted with a mean unsigned error of less than 1 kJ mol(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Popelier, Paul L.

A time-varying prior model is learned online as the likelihood of particle filter in order to adapt to dynamic characteristics of state and observation. Thanks to semi-supervised learning, the proposed particle filter can improve efficiency and accuracy, where the amount of available labelled training data is limited. The authors compare the proposed algorithm with the particle filter based on supervised learning. The algorithms are evaluated for received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based distributed location estimation for MSN in which communication bandwidth and accuracy of the range measurement are limited. First, experimental results show that the semi-supervised algorithm can learn suddenly-changed RSSI characteristics while the supervised learning cannot. Second, the proposed particle filter is more accurate and robust against variations of the environment such as new obstacle configurations. Furthermore, the suggested particle filter shows low statistical variability during repeated experiments, confirmed by much smaller error deviation than the compared particle filter.

We examine the ability of MANOVA to detect trait-associated genetic loci in the presence of gene-gene interactions. We present a novel Bayesian nonparametric method designed to detect such interactions. Results: MANOVA and the Bayesian nonparametric approach show good ability to detect trait-associated genetic variants under various possible genetic models. It is shown through several sets of analyses that this may be due to marginal effects being present, even if the underlying genetic model does not explicitly contain them. Conclusions: Understanding how genetic interactions affect drug response continues to be a critical goal. MANOVA and the novel Bayesian framework present a trade-off between computational complexity and model flexibility.

J	Sherwin, JS; Gaston, JR				Sherwin, Jason Samuel; Gaston, Jeremy Rodney			Experience Does Not Equal Expertise in Recognizing Infrequent Incoming Gunfire: Neural Markers for Experience and Task Expertise at Peak Behavioral Performance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY LORETA; BRAIN; FMRI; EEG; NEGATIVITY; ERP	For a soldier, decisions to use force can happen rapidly and sometimes lead to undesired consequences. In many of these situations, there is a rapid assessment by the shooter that recognizes a threat and responds to it with return fire. But the neural processes underlying these rapid decisions are largely unknown, especially amongst those with extensive weapons experience and expertise. In this paper, we investigate differences in weapons experts and non-experts during an incoming gunfire detection task. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalography (EEG) of eleven expert marksmen/soldiers and eleven non-experts while they listened to an audio scene consisting of a sequence of incoming and non-incoming gunfire events. Subjects were tasked with identifying each event as quickly as possible and committing their choice via a motor response. Contrary to our hypothesis, experts did not have significantly better behavioral performance or faster response time than novices. Rather, novices indicated trends of better behavioral performance than experts. These group differences were more dramatic in the EEG correlates of incoming gunfire detection. Using machine learning, we found condition-discriminating EEG activity among novices showing greater magnitude and covering longer periods than those found in experts. We also compared group-level source reconstruction on the maximum discriminating neural correlates and found that each group uses different neural structures to perform the task. From condition-discriminating EEG and source localization, we found that experts perceive more categorical overlap between incoming and non-incoming gunfire. Consequently, the experts did not perform as well behaviorally as the novices. We explain these unexpected group differences as a consequence of experience with gunfire not being equivalent to expertise in recognizing incoming gunfire.

J	Zhang, C; Huang, ZF				Zhang, Chen; Huang, Zhenfang			Mining Tourist Motive for Marketing Development via Twice-Learning	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; HONG-KONG; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; STRUCTURAL MODEL; TIME-SERIES; DEMAND; DESTINATION; TRAVEL; MOTIVATION; DIAGNOSIS	Prediction of tourist decision-making processes, including tourist motive, attitude, behavior, and so on, is of great importance for the development of tourism marketing strategies. Recently, applying machine learning techniques to predict tourist decision-making processes has drawn much attention. However, many machine learning techniques applied in the tourist decision-making prediction task fail to address two practical yet important problems. One is the failure of constructing models that can generate accurate yet comprehensible predictions at the same time, and the other is the failure to accommodate the characteristics of data collected from tourists that is usually small yet noise prone. In this article, we address the two entangled problems using the twice-learning framework to predict tourist motive from tourist external and internal features data collected through on-site survey. The results indicate that, based on the two-phase learning process, we can predict tourist motive accurately as well as extract meaningful insights, which are useful for targeted marketing strategies development from the real-world data.

J	Silva, TC; Zhao, L				Silva, Thiago Christiano; Zhao, Liang			High-level pattern-based classification via tourist walks in networks	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						High-level classification; Tourist walk; Supervised learning; Complex network; Machine learning; Pattern recognition	SEMANTIC WEB; RECOGNITION	In this paper, we present a hybrid classification technique, which combines the decisions of low- and high-level classifiers. The low-level term realizes the classification task considering only the input data's physical features, such as geometrical or statistical characteristics. In contrast, the high-level classification process checks the compliance of the new test instances against the pattern formations of each class that composes the training data. For this end, we extract suitable organizational and topological descriptors of a network that is constructed from the input data. With these descriptors, we show that the high-level term has the ability of detecting data patterns with semantic and global meanings. Here, the input data's pattern formations are extracted by utilizing the dynamical information generated from several tourist walk processes, which are performed on the resulting network. Specifically, weighted combinations of transient and cycle lengths, which are derived variables from the tourist walks, are employed. Moreover, we show an effective method for calibrating the learning weights of these terms by using a statistical approach. Furthermore, we show that the tourist's memory size is related to what extent one may capture organizational and complex features of the network. This means that local, quasi-local, and global features can be extracted, depending on the value of memory size parameter. Still in this work, we uncover the existence of a critical memory length, here denominated complex saturation, where any values larger than this critical point make no changes in the behaviors of the transient and cycle lengths. We also investigate several artificial and real-world situations where the low-level term alone fails to identify intrinsic data patterns, but the high-level term is able to perform well. Our investigation suggests that the proposed technique is able to improve the already optimized performance of traditional classification techniques. Finally, we apply the proposed technique in recognizing handwritten digits images and interesting results are obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Lv, SG; Zhou, FY				Lv, Shaogao; Zhou, Fanyin			Optimal learning rates of l(p)-type multiple kernel learning under general conditions	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Multiple kernel learning; Kernel learning; Correlation measure; Generalization ability; Local Rademacher complexity	CONSISTENCY	One of the most promising learning kernel methods is the I-P-type multiple kernel learning proposed by Kloft et al. (2009). This method can adaptively select kernel function in supervised learning problems. The majority of the studies associated with generalization error have recently received wide attention in machine learning and statistics. The present study aims to establish a new generalization error bound under more general frameworks, in which the correlation among reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) is considered, and the restriction of smooth condition on the target function is relaxed. In this case, the interaction between the estimation and approximation errors must be simultaneously regarded. In this investigation, optimal learning rates are derived by applying the local Rademacher complexity technique, which is given in terms of the capacity of RKHSs spanned by multi-kernels and target function regularity.

UNSUPERVISED TRANSIENT LIGHT CURVE ANALYSIS VIA HIERARCHICAL BAYESIAN INFERENCE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: numerical; methods: statistical; supernovae: general; surveys	CORE-COLLAPSE SUPERNOVAE; HAMILTONIAN MONTE-CARLO; PAN-STARRS; HOST GALAXIES; MODELS; NUCLEOSYNTHESIS; PROGENITORS; REGRESSION; TELESCOPE; EVOLUTION	Historically, light curve studies of supernovae (SNe) and other transient classes have focused on individual objects with copious and high signal-to-noise observations. In the nascent era of wide field transient searches, objects with detailed observations are decreasing as a fraction of the overall known SN population, and this strategy sacrifices the majority of the information contained in the data about the underlying population of transients. A population level modeling approach, simultaneously fitting all available observations of objects in a transient sub-class of interest, fully mines the data to infer the properties of the population and avoids certain systematic biases. We present a novel hierarchical Bayesian statistical model for population level modeling of transient light curves, and discuss its implementation using an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique. As a test case, we apply this model to the Type IIP SN sample from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey, consisting of 18,837 photometric observations of 76 SNe, corresponding to a joint posterior distribution with 9176 parameters under our model. Our hierarchical model fits provide improved constraints on light curve parameters relevant to the physical properties of their progenitor stars relative to modeling individual light curves alone. Moreover, we directly evaluate the probability for occurrence rates of unseen light curve characteristics from the model hyperparameters, addressing observational biases in survey methodology. We view this modeling framework as an unsupervised machine learning technique with the ability to maximize scientific returns from data to be collected by future wide field transient searches like LSST.

Learning to identify CNS drug action and efficacy using multistudy fMRI data	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							CHRONIC PAIN; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; HUMANS; MODULATION; ANALGESIA; INFERENCE; CIRCUITRY	The therapeutic effects of centrally acting pharmaceuticals can manifest gradually and unreliably in patients, making the drug discovery process slow and expensive. Biological markers providing early evidence for clinical efficacy could help prioritize development of the more promising drug candidates. A potential source of such markers is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a noninvasive imaging technique that can complement molecular imaging. fMRI has been used to characterize how drugs cause changes in brain activity. However, variation in study protocols and analysis techniques has made it difficult to identify consistent associations between subtle modulations of brain activity and clinical efficacy. We present and validate a general protocol for functional imaging-based assessment of drug activity in the central nervous system. The protocol uses machine learning methods and data from multiple published studies to identify reliable associations between drug-related activity modulations and drug efficacy, which can then be used to assess new data. A proof-of-concept version of this approach was developed and is shown here for analgesics (pain medication), and validated with eight separate studies of analgesic compounds. Our results show that the systematic integration of multistudy data permits the generalized inferences required for drug discovery. Multistudy integrative strategies of this type could help optimize the drug discovery and validation pipeline.

EEG was recorded from a large sample of subjects (n = 289) who had answered questionnaires measuring personality trait scores of the five dimensions as well as the 10 subordinate aspects of the Big Five. Machine learning algorithms were used to build a classifier to predict each personality trait from power spectra of the resting state EEG data. The results indicate that the five dimensions as well as their subordinate aspects could not be predicted from the resting state EEG data. Finally, to demonstrate that this result is not due to systematic algorithmic or implementation mistakes the same methods were used to successfully classify whether the subject had eyes open or closed. These results indicate that the extraction of personality traits from the power spectra of resting state EEG is extremely noisy, if possible at all.

J	Guo, W; Fukatsu, T; Ninomiya, S				Guo, Wei; Fukatsu, Tokihiro; Ninomiya, Seishi			Automated characterization of flowering dynamics in rice using field-acquired time-series RGB images	PLANT METHODS			English	Article						Time-series RGB image; SIFT; BoVWs; SVM	LEAF-AREA INDEX; HIGH-TEMPERATURE STRESS; DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; FEATURES; GROWTH; SEGMENTATION; STRATEGIES; SYSTEM	Background: Flowering (spikelet anthesis) is one of the most important phenotypic characteristics of paddy rice, and researchers expend efforts to observe flowering timing. Observing flowering is very time-consuming and labor-intensive, because it is still visually performed by humans. An image-based method that automatically detects the flowering of paddy rice is highly desirable. However, varying illumination, diversity of appearance of the flowering parts of the panicles, shape deformation, partial occlusion, and complex background make the development of such a method challenging. Results: We developed a method for detecting flowering panicles of rice in RGB images using scale-invariant feature transform descriptors, bag of visual words, and a machine learning method, support vector machine. Applying the method to time-series images, we estimated the number of flowering panicles and the diurnal peak of flowering on each day. The method accurately detected the flowering parts of panicles during the flowering period and quantified the daily and diurnal flowering pattern. Conclusions: A powerful method for automatically detecting flowering panicles of paddy rice in time-series RGB images taken under natural field conditions is described.

Quantum bootstrapping via compressed quantum Hamiltonian learning	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						quantum information; characterization; Lieb-Robinson bounds; machine learning; quantum simulation	TRACKING; PROPAGATION	A major problem facing the development of quantum computers or large scale quantum simulators is that general methods for characterizing and controlling are intractable. We provide a new approach to this problem that uses small quantum simulators to efficiently characterize and learn control models for larger devices. Our protocol achieves this by using Bayesian inference in concert with Lieb-Robinson bounds and interactive quantum learning methods to achieve compressed simulations for characterization. We also show that the Lieb-Robinson velocity is epistemic for our protocol, meaning that information propagates at a rate that depends on the uncertainty in the system Hamiltonian. We illustrate the efficiency of our bootstrapping protocol by showing numerically that an 8 qubit Ising model simulator can be used to calibrate and control a 50 qubit Ising simulator while using only about 750 kilobits of experimental data. Finally, we provide upper bounds for the Fisher information that show that the number of experiments needed to characterize a system rapidly diverges as the duration of the experiments used in the characterization shrinks, which motivates the use of methods such as ours that do not require short evolution times.

J	Bala, A; Chana, I				Bala, Anju; Chana, Inderveer			Intelligent failure prediction models for scientific workflows	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cloud Computing; Workflows; Failure prediction; Scientific workflows; Machine learning	SOFTWARE FAULT PREDICTION; CLOUD; ENVIRONMENTS; ALGORITHMS; SERVICE	The ever-growing demand and heterogeneity of Cloud Computing is garnering popularity with scientific communities to utilize the services of Cloud for executing large scale scientific applications in the form of set of tasks known as Workflows. As scientific workflows stipulate a process or computation to be executed in the form of data flow and task dependencies that allow users to simply articulate multi-step computational and complex tasks. Hence, proactive fault tolerance is required for the execution of scientific workflows. To reduce the failure effect of workflow tasks on the Cloud resources during execution, task failures can be intelligently predicted by proactively analyzing the data of multiple scientific workflows using the state of the art of machine learning approaches for failure prediction. Therefore, this paper makes an effort to focus on the research problem of designing an intelligent task failure prediction models for facilitating proactive fault tolerance by predicting task failures for Scientific Workflow applications. Firstly, failure prediction models have been implemented through machine learning approaches using evaluated performance metrics and also demonstrates the maximum prediction accuracy for Naive Bayes. Then, the proposed failure models have also been validated using Pegasus and Amazon EC2 by comparing actual task failures with predicted task failures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This flood of SMS goes with the problem of spam SMS that are generated by spurious users. The detection of spam SMS has gotten more attention of researchers in recent times and is treated with a number of different machine learning approaches. Supervised machine learning approaches, used so far, demands a large amount of labeled data which is not always available in real applications. The traditional semi-supervised methods can alleviate this problem but may not produce good results if they are provided with only positive and unlabeled data. In this paper, we have proposed a novel semi-supervised learning method which makes use of frequent itemset and ensemble learning (FIEL) to overcome this limitation. In this approach, Apriori algorithm has been used for finding the frequent itemset while Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest and LibSVM are used as base learners for ensemble learning which uses majority voting scheme. Our proposed approach works well with small number of positive data and different amounts of unlabeled dataset with higher accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted over UCI SMS spam collection data set, SMS spam collection Corpus v.0.1 Small and Big which show significant improvements in accuracy with very small amount of positive data. We have compared our proposed FIEL approach with the existing SPY-EM and PEBL approaches and the results show that our approach is more stable than the compared approaches with minimum support.

Data imbalance problem has received considerable attention in machine learning community because it is one of the main causes that degrade the performance of classifiers or predictors. In this paper, we propose geometric mean based boosting algorithm (GMBoost) to resolve data imbalance problem. GMBoost enables learning with consideration of both majority and minority classes because it uses the geometric mean of both classes in error rate and accuracy calculation. To evaluate the performance of GMBoost, we have applied GMBoost to bankruptcy prediction task. The results and their comparative analysis with AdaBoost and cost-sensitive boosting indicate that GMBoost has the advantages of high prediction power and robust learning capability in imbalanced data as well as balanced data distribution.

Comparisons of machine learning techniques for detecting malicious webpages	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						K-Nearest Neighbor; Support Vector Machine; Naive Bayes; Affinity Propagation; K-Means; Supervised and unsupervised learning	VISUAL SIMILARITY ASSESSMENT; TEXT CATEGORIZATION; RETRIEVAL	This paper compares machine learning techniques for detecting malicious webpages. The conventional method of detecting malicious webpages is going through the black list and checking whether the webpages are listed. Black list is a list of webpages which are classified as malicious from a user's point of view. These black lists are created by trusted organizations and volunteers. They are then used by modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. However, black list is ineffective because of the frequent-changing nature of webpages, growing numbers of webpages that pose scalability issues and the crawlers' inability to visit intranet webpages that require computer operators to log in as authenticated users. In this paper therefore alternative and novel approaches are used by applying machine learning algorithms to detect malicious webpages. In this paper three supervised machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Classifier, and two unsupervised machine learning techniques such as K-Means and Affinity Propagation are employed. Please note that K-Means and Affinity Propagation have not been applied to detection of malicious webpages by other researchers. All these machine learning techniques have been used to build predictive models to analyze large number of malicious and safe webpages. These webpages were downloaded by a concurrent crawler taking advantage of gevent. The webpages were parsed and various features such as content, URL and screenshot of webpages were extracted to feed into the machine learning models. Computer simulation results have produced an accuracy of up to 98% for the supervised techniques and silhouette coefficient of close to 0.96 for the unsupervised techniques. These predictive models have been applied in a practical context whereby Google Chrome can harness the predictive capabilities of the classifiers that have the advantages of both the lightweight and the heavyweight classifiers.

In reality, the pronounced advantage of NB is often challenged by the strong conditional independence assumption between attributes, which may deteriorate the classification performance. Accordingly, numerous efforts have been made to improve NB, by using approaches such as structure extension, attribute selection, attribute weighting, instance weighting, local learning and so on. In this paper, we propose a new Artificial Immune System (AIS) based self-adaptive attribute weighting method for Naive Bayes classification. The proposed method, namely AISWNB, uses immunity theory in Artificial Immune Systems to search optimal attribute weight values, where self-adjusted weight values will alleviate the conditional independence assumption and help calculate the conditional probability in an accurate way. One noticeable advantage of AISWNB is that the unique immune system based evolutionary computation process, including initialization, clone, section, and mutation, ensures that AISWNB can adjust itself to the data without explicit specification of functional or distributional forms of the underlying model. As a result, AISWNB can obtain good attribute weight values during the learning process. Experiments and comparisons on 36 machine learning benchmark data sets and six image classification data sets demonstrate that AISWNB significantly outperforms its peers in classification accuracy, class probability estimation, and class ranking performance.

Artificial intelligence methods have gained popularity for optimal traffic light control. In this paper, a review of most important works in the field of controlling traffic signal timing, in particular studies focusing on Q-learning, neural network, and fuzzy logic system are presented. As per existing literature, the intelligent methods show a higher performance compared to traditional controlling methods. However, a study that compares the performance of different learning methods is not published yet. In this paper, the aforementioned computational intelligence methods and a fixed-time method are implemented to set signals times and minimize total delays for an isolated intersection. These methods are developed and compared on a same platform. The intersection is treated as an intelligent agent that learns to propose an appropriate green time for each phase. The appropriate green time for all the intelligent controllers are estimated based on the received traffic information. A comprehensive comparison is made between the performance of Q-learning, neural network, and fuzzy logic system controller for two different scenarios. The three intelligent learning controllers present close performances with multiple replication orders in two scenarios. On average Q-learning has 66%, neural network 71%, and fuzzy logic has 74% higher performance compared to the fixed-time controller. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of machine learning interpolation techniques for prediction of physical properties	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Superalloys; Database; Gaussian process; Neural network; Quadratic regression; Physical properties; Computational dependence	DIRECT SEARCH ALGORITHM; HETEROGENEOUS MARTENSITIC NUCLEATION; LINEAR INTERPOLATION; START TEMPERATURE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGRESSION; DESIGN; MODELS; STEELS; DATABASES	A knowledge of the physical properties of materials as a function of temperature, composition, applied external stresses, etc. is an important consideration in materials and process design. For new systems, such properties may be unknown and hard to measure or estimate from numerical simulations such as molecular dynamics. Engineers rely on machine learning to employ existing data in order to predict properties for new systems. Several techniques are currently used for such purposes. These include neural network, polynomial interpolation and Gaussian processes as well as the more recent dynamic trees and scalable Gaussian processes. In this paper we compare these approaches for three sets of materials sciences data: molar volume, electrical conductivity and Martensite start temperature. We make recommendations depending on the nature of the data. We demonstrate that a thorough knowledge of the problem beforehand is critical in selecting the most successful machine learning technique. Our findings show that the Gaussian process regression technique gives very good predictions for all three sets of tested data. Typically, Gaussian process is very slow with a computational complexity of typically n(3) where n is the number of data points. In this paper, we found that the scalable Gaussian process approach was able to maintain the high accuracy of the predictions while improving speed considerably, make on-line learning possible.

This extended model is closely related to the Boltzmann machine learning. In this paper we aim to infer the correct biases and interactions of our model by considering a relatively small number of sets of training data. Nevertheless, the greedy algorithm that we employed in the present study exhibits good performance with a few number of training data. The key point is the sparseness of the interactions in our problem in the context of the Boltzmann machine learning: the existence of cheating students is expected to be very rare (possibly even in real world). We compare a standard approach to infer the sparse interactions in the Boltzmann machine learning to our greedy algorithm and we find the latter to be superior in several aspects.

Label free quantification of time evolving morphologies using time-lapse video microscopy enables identity control of cell lines and discovery of chemically induced differential activity in iso-genic cell line pairs	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Time evolving morphology; Quality control; Iso-genic cell line; Cancer pharmacology; Time-lapse microscopy; Video microscopy	MICROCULTURE CYTOTOXICITY ASSAY; PASSAGE NUMBER; IDENTIFICATION; CULTURE	Label free time-lapse video microscopy based monitoring of time evolving cell population morphology has potential to offer a simple and cost effective method for identity control of cell lines. Such morphology monitoring also has potential to offer discovery of chemically induced differential changes between pairs of cell lines of interest, for example where one in a pair of cell lines is normal/sensitive and the other malignant/resistant. A new simple algorithm, pixel histogram hierarchy comparison (PHHC), for comparison of time evolving morphologies (TEM) in phase contrast time-lapse microscopy movies was applied to a set of 10 different cell lines and three different iso-genic colon cancer cell line pairs, each pair being genetically identical except for a single mutation. PHHC quantifies differences in morphology by comparing pixel histogram intensities at six different resolutions. Unsupervised clustering and machine learning based classification methods were found to accurately identify cell lines, including their respective iso-genic variants, through time-evolving morphology. Using this experimental setting, drugs with differential activity in iso-genic cell line pairs were likewise identified. Thus, this is a cost effective and expedient alternative to conventional molecular profiling techniques and might be useful as part of the quality control in research incorporating cell line models, e.g. in any cell/tumor biology or toxicology project involving drug/agent differential activity in pairs of cell line models.

Novel algorithmic approaches for the prediction of these sites have been produced at a rapid rate, and the field has seen significant advancement over the past decade. However, the most current methods have not yet been reviewed in a systematic and comprehensive fashion. Herein, we describe the intricacies of the biological theory, datasets, and features required for modern protein-protein interaction site (PPIS) prediction, and present an integrative analysis of the state-of-the-art algorithms and their performance. First, the major sources of data used by predictors are reviewed, including training sets, evaluation sets, and methods for their procurement. Then, the features employed and their importance in the biological characterization of PPISs are explored. This is followed by a discussion of the methodologies adopted in contemporary prediction programs, as well as their relative performance on the datasets most recently used for evaluation. In addition, the potential utility that PPIS identification holds for rational drug design, hotspot prediction, and computational molecular docking is described. Finally, an analysis of the most promising areas for future development of the field is presented.

The Decisional DNA is a domain-independent, standard and flexible knowledge representation structure that allows its domains to acquire, store, and share experiential knowledge and formal decision events in an explicit way. We apply this approach to our current work-SmartBike, a sensor-equipped bicycle built under the concept of Internet of Things. By using Decisional DNA and machine learning algorithms, the SmartBike is able to distinguish its user's patterns based on past riding data. The presented conceptual approach demonstrates how Decisional DNA can be applied to the Internet of Things and bring to them intelligence required by forthcoming semantic networks.

We used machine learning with TF motifs and ChIP data for a core set of cardiogenic TFs and histone modifications to classify Drosophila cell-type-specific cardiac enhancer activity. We show that the classifier models can be used to predict cardiac cell subtype cis-regulatory activities. Associating the predicted enhancers with an expression atlas of cardiac genes further uncovered clusters of genes with transcription and function limited to individual cardiac cell subtypes. Further, the cell-specific enhancer models revealed chromatin, TF binding and sequence features that distinguish enhancer activities in distinct subsets of heart cells. Collectively, our results show that computational modeling combined with empirical testing provides a powerful platform to uncover the enhancers, TF motifs and gene expression profiles which characterize individual cardiac cell fates.

This sporadic activity is thought to play a role in memory consolidation, brain plasticity, and protection of sleep integrity. Many automatic detectors have been proposed to assist or replace experts for sleep spindle scoring. However, these algorithms usually detect too many events making it difficult to achieve a good tradeoff between sensitivity (Se) and false detection rate (FDr). In this work, we propose a semi-automatic detector comprising a sensitivity phase based on well-established criteria followed by a specificity phase using spatial and spectral criteria. In the sensitivity phase, selected events are those which amplitude in the 10-16 Hz band and spectral ratio characteristics both reject a null hypothesis (p < 0.1) stating that the considered event is not a spindle. This null hypothesis is constructed from events occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep epochs. In the specificity phase, a hierarchical clustering of the selected candidates is done based on events' frequency and spatial position along the anterior-posterior axis. Only events from the classes grouping most (at least 80%) spindles scored by an expert are kept. We obtain Se = 93.2% and FDr = 93.0% in the first phase and Se = 85.4% and FDr = 86.2% in the second phase. For these two phases, Matthew's correlation coefficients are respectively 0.228 and 0.324. Results suggest that spindles are defined by specific spatio-spectral properties and that automatic detection methods can be improved by considering these features.

J	Zhong, CM; Malinen, M; Miao, DQ; Franti, P				Zhong, Caiming; Malinen, Mikko; Miao, Duoqian; Franti, Pasi			A fast minimum spanning tree algorithm based on K-means	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Minimum spanning tree; Clustering; Manifold learning; K-means	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; CLUSTER VALIDITY; SPACE; IMPLEMENTATION; SEGMENTATION; COMPLEXITY; DESIGN; GRAPHS; FOREST	Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) have long been used in data mining, pattern recognition and machine learning. However, it is difficult to apply traditional MST algorithms to a large dataset since the time complexity of the algorithms is quadratic. In this paper, we present a fast MST (FMST) algorithm on the complete graph of N points. The proposed algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer scheme to produce an approximate MST with theoretical time complexity of O(N-1.5), which is faster than the conventional MST algorithms with O(N-2). It consists of two stages. In the first stage, called the divide-and-conquer stage, K-means is employed to partition a dataset into root N clusters. Then an exact MST algorithm is applied to each cluster and the produced root N MSTs are connected in terms of a proposed criterion to form an approximate MST. In the second stage, called the refinement stage, the clusters produced in the first stage form root N - 1 neighboring pairs, and the dataset is repartitioned into root N - 1 clusters with the purpose of partitioning the neighboring boundaries of a neighboring pair into a cluster. With the root N - 1 clusters, another approximate MST is constructed. Finally, the two approximate MSTs are combined into a graph and a more accurate MST is generated from it. The proposed algorithm can be regarded as a framework, since any exact MST algorithm can be incorporated into the framework to reduce its running time. Experimental results show that the proposed approximate MST algorithm is computationally efficient, and the approximation is close to the exact MST so that in practical applications the performance does not suffer.

This paper presents a novel machine learning framework for ranking based on document groups. Multiple level labels represent the relevance of documents. The values of labels are used to quantify the relevance of the documents. According to a given query in the training set, the documents are divided into several groups based upon their relevance labels. The group with higher relevance labels is always ranked upon the ones with lower relevance labels. Further a preference strategy is introduced in the loss functions, which are sensitive to the group with higher relevance labels to enhance the group ranking method. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach is very effective, with a 14 percent improvement on TD2003 dataset evaluated by MAP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We denote as pure the samples that identify clearly and without any ambiguity the class of objects of interest. For instance, in pedestrian detection algorithms, we consider as pure samples the ones containing persons who are fully visible and are imaged at a good resolution (larger than the detector window in size). The exclusive use of pure samples entails two kinds of problems. In training, it biases the detector to neglect slightly occluded and small sized samples (which we denote as impure), thus reducing its detection rate in a real world application. In testing, it leads to the unfair evaluation and comparison of different detectors since slightly impure samples, when detected, can be accounted for as false positives. In this paper we study how a sensible use of impure samples can benefit both the training and the evaluation of pedestrian detection algorithms. We improve the labelling of one of the most widely used pedestrian data sets (INRIA) taking into account the degree of sample impurity. We observe that including partially occluded pedestrians in the training improves performance, not only on partially visible examples, but also on the fully visible ones. Furthermore, we found that including pedestrians imaged at low resolutions is beneficial for detecting pedestrians in the same range of heights, leaving the performance on pure samples unchanged. However, including samples with too high a grade of impurity degrades the performance, thus a careful balance must be found. The proposed labelling will allow further studies on the role of impure samples in training pedestrian detectors and on devising fairer comparison metrics between different algorithms.

An important property of dynamic environments is non-stationarity, i.e., the assumption of an underlying data generating process that may change over time. Correspondingly, the ability to properly react to so-called concept change is considered as an important feature of learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new type of experimental analysis, called recovery analysis, which is aimed at assessing the ability of a learner to discover a concept change quickly, and to take appropriate measures to maintain the quality and generalization performance of the model. We develop recovery analysis for two types of supervised learning problems, namely classification and regression. Moreover, as a practical application, we make use of recovery analysis in order to compare model-based and instance-based approaches to learning on data streams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Single Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFN) are the most popular and easy to train. The neurons in these networks can use both sigmoidal functions and radial basis functions.(RBF) as activation functions. Both functions have been shown to work very efficiently. Sigmoidal networks are already very well described in the literature. This paper will focus on the construction of a SLFN architecture using RBF neurons. There are many algorithms that are used to construct or train networks to solve function approximation problems. In this paper, an algorithm which is a modification of the Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (I-ELM) family of algorithms is proposed. The proposed algorithm eliminates randomness in the learning process with respect to center positions and widths of the RBF neurons. To do this, the input with the highest error magnitude is saved during error calculation and then used as the center for the next incrementally added neuron. Then the radius of the new neuron is iteratively chosen using Nelder-Mead's Simplex method. This allows the universal approximation properties of I-ELM to be preserved while greatly reducing the sizes of the trained RBF networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In that context, Hoeffding trees represent the state-of-the-art algorithms for online classification. Their popularity stems in large part from their ability to process large quantities of data with a speed that goes beyond the processing power of any other streaming or batch learning algorithm. As a consequence, Hoeffding trees have often been used as base models of many ensemble learning algorithms for online classification. However, despite the existence of many algorithms for online classification, ensemble learning algorithms for online regression do not exist. In particular, the field of online any-time regression analysis seems to have experienced a serious lack of attention. In this paper, we address this issue through a study and an empirical evaluation of a set of online algorithms for regression, which includes the baseline Hoeffding-based regression trees, online option trees, and an online least mean squares filter. We also design, implement and evaluate two novel ensemble learning methods for online regression: online bagging with Hoeffding-based model trees, and an online RandomForest method in which we have used a randomized version of the online model tree learning algorithm as a basic building block. Within the study presented in this paper, we evaluate the proposed algorithms along several dimensions: predictive accuracy and quality of models, time and memory requirements, bias-variance and bias-variance-covariance decomposition of the error, and responsiveness to concept drift.

Many dimensionality reduction techniques exist for generating visual embeddings, but it is often hard to avoid cluttered projections when the data is large in size and noisy. For many application users who are not machine learning experts, it is difficult to control the process in order to improve the "readability" of the projection and at the same time to understand their quality. In this paper, we propose a simple interactive feature transformation approach that allows the analyst to de-clutter the visualization by gradually transforming the original feature space based on existing class knowledge. By changing a single parameter, the user can easily decide the desired trade-off between structural preservation and the visual quality during the transforming process. The proposed approach integrates semi-interactive feature transformation techniques as well as a variety of quality measures to help analysts generate uncluttered projections and understand their quality.

J	Capra, JA				Capra, John A.			Extrapolating histone marks across developmental stages, tissues, and species: an enhancer prediction case study	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Enhancers; Gene regulation; Data integration; Heart development; Machine learning	TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-BINDING; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; GENE-EXPRESSION; HUMAN GENOME; DIFFERENTIATION; TRANSITIONS; SIGNATURE; DYNAMICS; STATE; FATE	Background: Dynamic activation and inactivation of gene regulatory DNA produce the expression changes that drive the differentiation of cellular lineages. Identifying regulatory regions active during developmental transitions is necessary to understand how the genome specifies complex developmental programs and how these processes are disrupted in disease. Gene regulatory dynamics are mediated by many factors, including the binding of transcription factors (TFs) and the methylation and acetylation of DNA and histones. Genome-wide maps of TF binding and DNA and histone modifications have been generated for many cellular contexts; however, given the diversity and complexity of animal development, these data cover only a small fraction of the cellular and developmental contexts of interest. Thus, there is a need for methods that use existing epigenetic and functional genomics data to analyze the thousands of contexts that remain uncharacterized. Results: To investigate the utility of histone modification data in the analysis of cellular contexts without such data, I evaluated how well genome-wide H3K27ac and H3K4me1 data collected in different developmental stages, tissues, and species were able to predict experimentally validated heart enhancers active at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) in mouse. Using a machine-learning approach to integrate the data from different contexts, I found that E11.5 heart enhancers can often be predicted accurately from data from other contexts, and I quantified the contribution of each data source to the predictions. The utility of each dataset correlated with nearness in developmental time and tissue to the target context: data from late developmental stages and adult heart tissues were most informative for predicting E11.5 enhancers, while marks from stem cells and early developmental stages were less informative. Predictions based on data collected in non-heart tissues and in human hearts were better than random, but worse than using data from mouse hearts. Conclusions: The ability of these algorithms to accurately predict developmental enhancers based on data from related, but distinct, cellular contexts suggests that combining computational models with epigenetic data sampled from relevant contexts may be sufficient to enable functional characterization of many cellular contexts of interest.

J	Kim, S; Lu, ZY; Wilbur, J				Kim, Sun; Lu, Zhiyong; Wilbur, John			Identifying named entities from PubMed (R) for enriching semantic categories	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Semantic term extraction; Natural language processing; Machine learning	BIOMEDICAL TEXT; TERM IDENTIFICATION; CONCEPT EXTRACTION; BIOLOGICAL TEXTS; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM	Background: Controlled vocabularies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS (R)) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH (R)) are widely used for biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the standard terminology in such collections suffers from low usage in biomedical literature, e.g. only 13% of UMLS terms appear in MEDLINE (R). Results: We here propose an efficient and effective method for extracting noun phrases for biomedical semantic categories. The proposed approach utilizes simple linguistic patterns to select candidate noun phrases based on headwords, and a machine learning classifier is used to filter out noisy phrases. For experiments, three NLP rules were tested and manually evaluated by three annotators. Our approaches showed over 93% precision on average for the headwords, "gene", "protein", "disease", "cell" and "cells". Conclusions: Although biomedical terms in knowledge-rich resources may define semantic categories, variations of the controlled terms in literature are still difficult to identify. The method proposed here is an effort to narrow the gap between controlled vocabularies and the entities used in text. Our extraction method cannot completely eliminate manual evaluation, however a simple and automated solution with high precision performance provides a convenient way for enriching semantic categories by incorporating terms obtained from the literature.

MiRNAs are differentially expressed in specific tissues, during specific cell status, or in different diseases as tumours. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method for the analysis of differential gene expression. Using machine learning algorithms, it is possible to improve the functional significance interpretation of miRNA in the analysis and interpretation of data from RNA-seq. Furthermore, we tried to identify some patterns of deregulated miRNA in human breast cancer (BC), in order to give a contribution in the understanding of this type of cancer at the molecular level. Results: We adopted a biclustering approach, using the Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) algorithm, in order to evaluate miRNA deregulation in the context of miRNA abundance and tissue heterogeneity. These are important elements to identify miRNAs that would be useful as prognostic and diagnostic markers. Considering a real word breast cancer dataset, the evaluation of miRNA differential expressions in tumours versus healthy tissues evidenced 12 different miRNA clusters, associated to specific groups of patients. The identified miRNAs were deregulated in breast tumours compared to healthy controls. Our approach has shown the association between specific sub-class of tumour samples having the same immuno-histo-chemical and/or histological features. Biclusters have been validated by means of two online repositories, MetaMirClust database and UCSC Genome Browser, and using another biclustering algorithm. Conclusions: The obtained results with biclustering algorithm aimed first of all to give a contribute in the differential expression analysis in a cohort of BC patients and secondly to support the potential role that these non-coding RNA molecules could play in the clinical practice, in terms of prognosis, evolution of tumour and treatment response.

Molecular interactions between pathogens and their hosts are the key parts of the infection mechanisms. Novel antimicrobial therapeutics to fight drug resistance is only possible in case of a thorough understanding of pathogen-host interaction (PHI) systems. Existing databases, which contain experimentally verified PHI data, suffer from scarcity of reported interactions due to the technically challenging and time consuming process of experiments. These have motivated many researchers to address the problem by proposing computational approaches for analysis and prediction of PHIs. The computational methods primarily utilize sequence information, protein structure and known interactions. Classic machine learning techniques are used when there are sufficient known interactions to be used as training data. On the opposite case, transfer and multitask learning methods are preferred. Here, we present an overview of these computational approaches for predicting PHI systems, discussing their weakness and abilities, with future directions.

Different textural approaches have been previously investigated for characterizing chondrocyte organization on PCI-CT to enable classification of healthy and osteoarthritic cartilage. However, the large size of feature sets extracted in such studies motivates an investigation into algorithmic feature reduction for computing efficient feature representations without compromising their discriminatory power. For this purpose, geometrical feature sets derived from the scaling index method (SIM) were extracted from 1392 volumes of interest (VOI) annotated on PCI-CT images of ex vivo human patellar cartilage specimens. The extracted feature sets were subject to linear and non-linear dimension reduction techniques as well as feature selection based on evaluation of mutual information criteria. The reduced feature set was subsequently used in a machine learning task with support vector regression to classify VOIs as healthy or osteoarthritic; classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results show that the classification performance achieved by 9-D SIM-derived geometric feature sets (AUC: 0.96 +/- 0.02) can be maintained with 2-D representations computed from both dimension reduction and feature selection (AUC values as high as 0.97 +/- 0.02). Thus, such feature reduction techniques can offer a high degree of compaction to large feature sets extracted from PCI-CT images while maintaining their ability to characterize the underlying chondrocyte patterns.

J	Freitas, AA; Limbu, K; Ghafourian, T				Freitas, Alex A.; Limbu, Kriti; Ghafourian, Taravat			Predicting volume of distribution with decision tree-based regression methods using predicted tissue:plasma partition coefficients	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Volume of distribution; Tissue partition; QSAR; QSPkR; Data mining; Machine learning; Decision tree; Pharmacokinetics; ADME	PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS; ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS; INTESTINAL-ABSORPTION; DRUG DISTRIBUTION; APPARENT VOLUME; IN-VIVO; MODELS; RAT; HUMANS; INVIVO	Background: Volume of distribution is an important pharmacokinetic property that indicates the extent of a drug's distribution in the body tissues. This paper addresses the problem of how to estimate the apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of chemical compounds in the human body using decision tree-based regression methods from the area of data mining (or machine learning). Hence, the pros and cons of several different types of decision tree-based regression methods have been discussed. The regression methods predict Vss using, as predictive features, both the compounds' molecular descriptors and the compounds' tissue: plasma partition coefficients (K-t:p) - often used in physiologically-based pharmacokinetics. Therefore, this work has assessed whether the data mining-based prediction of Vss can be made more accurate by using as input not only the compounds' molecular descriptors but also (a subset of) their predicted K-t:p values. Results: Comparison of the models that used only molecular descriptors, in particular, the Bagging decision tree (mean fold error of 2.33), with those employing predicted K-t:p values in addition to the molecular descriptors, such as the Bagging decision tree using adipose K-t:p (mean fold error of 2.29), indicated that the use of predicted K-t:p values as descriptors may be beneficial for accurate prediction of Vss using decision trees if prior feature selection is applied. Conclusions: Decision tree based models presented in this work have an accuracy that is reasonable and similar to the accuracy of reported Vss inter-species extrapolations in the literature. The estimation of Vss for new compounds in drug discovery will benefit from methods that are able to integrate large and varied sources of data and flexible non-linear data mining methods such as decision trees, which can produce interpretable models.

Possible applications include single molecule DNA and protein sequencing. This paper addresses several fundamental aspects of RT by multiscale theory, applying both all-atom and coarse-grained DNA models: (1) we show that the magnitude of the observed currents are consistent with the results of non-equilibrium Green's function calculations carried out on a solvated all-atom model. (2) Brownian fluctuations in hydrogen bond-lengths lead to current spikes that are similar to what is observed experimentally. (3) The frequency characteristics of these fluctuations can be used to identify the trapped molecules with a machine-learning algorithm, giving a theoretical underpinning to this new method of identifying single molecule signals.

J	Binder, H; Blettner, M				Binder, Harald; Blettner, Maria			Big Data in Medical Science- a Biostatistical View Part 21 of a Series on Evaluation of Scientific Publications	DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL			English	Review							SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ALGORITHMS; ROADMAP	Background: Inexpensive techniques for measurement and data storage now enable medical researchers to acquire far more data than can conveniently be analyzed by traditional methods. The expression "big data" refers to quantities on the order of magnitude of a terabyte (10(12) bytes); special techniques must be used to evaluate such huge quantities of data in a scientifically meaningful way. Whether data sets of this size are useful and important is an open question that currently confronts medical science. Methods: In this article, we give illustrative examples of the use of analytical techniques for big data and discuss them in the light of a selective literature review. We point out some critical aspects that should be considered to avoid errors when large amounts of data are analyzed. Results: Machine learning techniques enable the recognition of potentially relevant patterns. When such techniques are used, certain additional steps should be taken that are unnecessary in more traditional analyses; for example, patient characteristics should be differentially weighted. If this is not done as a preliminary step before similarity detection, which is a component of many data analysis operations, characteristics such as age or sex will be weighted no higher than any one out of 10 000 gene expression values. Experience from the analysis of conventional observational data sets can be called upon to draw conclusions about potential causal effects from big data sets. Conclusion: Big data techniques can be used, for example, to evaluate observational data derived from the routine care of entire populations, with clustering methods used to analyze therapeutically relevant patient subgroups. Such analyses can provide complementary information to clinical trials of the classic type. As big data analyses become more popular, various statistical techniques for causality analysis in observational data are becoming more widely available. This is likely to be of benefit to medical science, but specific adaptations will have to be made according to the requirements of the applications.

Genome-wide features of neuroendocrine regulation in Drosophila by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor DIMMED	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							CORE VESICLE MATURATION; ALPHA-AMIDATING MONOOXYGENASE; MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; SUBCELLULAR DOMAINS; SECRETORY GRANULES; CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-D; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; GENE-EXPRESSION; SALIVARY-GLAND	Neuroendocrine (NE) cells use large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) to traffic, process, store and secrete neuropeptide hormones through the regulated secretory pathway. The dimmed (DIMM) basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor of Drosophila controls the level of regulated secretory activity in NE cells. To pursue its mechanisms, we have performed two independent genome-wide analyses of DIMM's activities: (i) in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to define genomic sites of DIMM occupancy and (ii) deep sequencing of purified DIMM neurons to characterize their transcriptional profile. By this combined approach, we showed that DIMM binds to conserved E-boxes in enhancers of 212 genes whose expression is enriched in DIMM-expressing NE cells. DIMM binds preferentially to certain E-boxes within first introns of specific gene isoforms. Statistical machine learning revealed that flanking regions of putative DIMM binding sites contribute to its DNA binding specificity. DIMM's transcriptional repertoire features at least 20 LDCV constituents. In addition, DIMM notably targets the pro-secretory transcription factor, creb-A, but significantly, DIMM does not target any neuropeptide genes. DIMM therefore prescribes the scale of secretory activity in NE neurons, by a systematic control of both proximal and distal points in the regulated secretory pathway.

Aspects of structural health and condition monitoring of offshore wind turbines	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Review						structural health monitoring; condition monitoring; offshore wind turbines; data analysis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; VIBRATION SIGNALS; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DAMAGE DIAGNOSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PLANETARY GEAR	Wind power has expanded significantly over the past years, although reliability of wind turbine systems, especially of offshore wind turbines, has been many times unsatisfactory in the past. Wind turbine failures are equivalent to crucial financial losses. Therefore, creating and applying strategies that improve the reliability of their components is important for a successful implementation of such systems. Structural health monitoring (SHM) addresses these problems through the monitoring of parameters indicative of the state of the structure examined. Condition monitoring (CM), on the other hand, can be seen as a specialized area of the SHM community that aims at damage detection of, particularly, rotating machinery. The paper is divided into two parts: in the first part, advanced signal processing and machine learning methods are discussed for SHM and CM on wind turbine gearbox and blade damage detection examples. In the second part, an initial exploration of supervisor control and data acquisition systems data of an offshore wind farm is presented, and data-driven approaches are proposed for detecting abnormal behaviour of wind turbines. It is shown that the advanced signal processing methods discussed are effective and that it is important to adopt these SHM strategies in the wind energy sector.

Here we report our approach for improving INDEL calling accuracy by using a machine learning algorithm to combine call sets generated with three independent methods, and by leveraging the strengths of each individual pipeline. Utilizing this approach, we generated a consensus exome INDEL call set from a large dataset generated by the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G), maximizing both the sensitivity and the specificity of the calls. Results: This consensus exome INDEL call set features 7,210 INDELs, from 1,128 individuals across 13 populations included in the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 dataset, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of about 7.0%. Conclusions: In our study we further characterize the patterns and distributions of these exonic INDELs with respect to density, allele length, and site frequency spectrum, as well as the potential mutagenic mechanisms of coding INDELs in humans.

The increasing development of whole-sky images enables temporal and spatial high-resolution sky observations and provides the possibility to understand and quantify cloud effects more accurately. In this letter, an attempt has been made to examine the machine learning [multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks and support vector machine (SVM)] capabilities for automatic cloud detection in whole-sky images. The approaches have been tested on a significant number of whole-sky images (containing a variety of cloud overages in different seasons and at different daytimes) from Vigna di Valle and Tor Vergata test sites, located near Rome. The pixel values of red, green, and blue bands of the images have been used as inputs of the mentioned models, while the outputs provided classified pixels in terms of cloud coverage or others (cloud-free pixels and sun). For the test data set, the overall accuracies of 95.07%, with a standard deviation of 3.37, and 93.66%, with a standard deviation of 4.45, have been obtained from MLP neural networks and SVM models, respectively. Although the two approaches generally generate similar accuracies, the MLP neural networks gave a better performance in some specific cases where the SVM generates poor accuracy.

J	Ma, ZS				Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)			Towards computational models of animal cognition, an introduction for computer scientists	COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Animal cognition; Cognitive ecology; Social learning; Bioinspired computing and communication; Behavioral informatics; Computational behavior biology	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; EVOLUTIONARY GAME-THEORY; INSECT SOCIETIES; SOCIAL INSECTS; MULTIMODAL COMMUNICATION; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; DECISION-MAKING; TASK ALLOCATION; QUEUING DELAY; COLONY SIZE	The last few years of the twentieth century witnessed the emerging convergence of biology and computer science and this trend has been accelerating since then. The study of animal behavior or behavior biology has been one of the major contributors for this convergence. Behavior is fascinating because it is the response of an organism to internal and external signals and it is controlled by complex interactions among nerves, the sensory and the motor systems. To some extent, behavior is similar to the output (or response) of a computer system or a network node if we consider an animal brain as a computer node. This paper is the first in a two-part series in which I review the state-of-the-art research in behavior biology inspired computing and communication, with the first part focusing on animal cognition and the second part on animal communication (Ma, 2014). The present article also assumes the task of presenting a general introduction on behavior biology literature, which sets a foundation for synthesizing both parts of the series but the synthesis will be performed in the second part of the series. I sets three objectives in this 'cognition' part: (i) to present a brief overview on the literature of behavior biology for computer scientists; (ii) to summarize the state-of-the-art studies in several cognitive aspects of animal behavior: focusing on emerging research in cognitive ecology, social learning and innovation, as well as animal logics; (iii) to review some important existing studies inspired by animal behavior and further present a perspective on the future research. These cognition-related topics offer insights for research fields such as machine learning, human computer interactions (HCI), brain computer interfaces (BCIs), evolutionary computing, pervasive computing, etc. In perspective, I suggest that the interaction between behavioral biology and computer science should be bidirectional, and a new subject, behavioral informatics, or more general computational behavior biology, should be developed by the cooperative efforts between biologists and computer scientists.

Moreover, many years of research have led to good techniques to reduce the impact of noise, distortion and mismatch between training and test conditions on the recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, we still await systems that are truly robust against these confounding factors. The present paper extends recent work on acoustic modeling based on Reservoir Computing (RC), a concept that has its roots in Machine Learning. By introducing a novel analysis of reservoirs as non-linear dynamical systems, new insights are gained and translated into a new reservoir design recipe that is extremely simple and highly comprehensible in terms of the dynamics of the acoustic features and the modeled acoustic units. By tuning the reservoir to these dynamics, one can create RC-based systems that not only compete well with conventional systems in clean conditions, but also degrade more gracefully in noisy conditions. Control experiments show that noise robustness follows from the random fixation of the reservoir neurons whereas, tuning the reservoir dynamics increases the accuracy without compromising the noise-robustness.

The analytical information was obtained with a calibrated neural network that provides the best temperature estimation with respect to the selected colourimetric sensor responses from a previously developed sensor array. The sensor array was developed by embedding the linear spin crossover material [Fe-(NH(2)trz)(3)](BF4)(2) into polymers with different polarity, offering different thermochromic responses related to different morphologies of the spin crossover particles when embedded in each polymer. The different thermochromic responses are tracked by the green component of the RGB colour space and the a* from CIEL*a*b* obtained with a conventional photographic digital camera. These two colour signals are used as analytical parameters for the subsequent computer processing and model calibration. The use of multi-objective optimization techniques for neural network calibration demonstrated that only 3 signals coming from 3 sensors of the 6 studied are sufficient to provide optimal temperature estimation. The optimized selection was the green channel from polyurethane hydrogel D6 and PVC prepared in THF and a* from PMMA prepared in toluene. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Satellites, such as WindSat, provide large data sets for assessing the accuracy and computational efficiency of data selection techniques. A new data thinning technique, based on support vector regression (SVR), is developed and tested. To manage large on-line satellite data streams, observations from WindSat are formed into subsets by Voronoi tessellation and then each is thinned by SVR (TSVR). Three experiments are performed. The first confirms the viability of TSVR for a relatively small sample, comparing it to several commonly used data thinning methods (random selection, averaging and Barnes filtering), producing a 10% thinning rate (90% data reduction), low mean absolute errors (MAE) and large correlations with the original data. A second experiment, using a larger dataset, shows TSVR retrievals with MAE < 1 m s(-1) and correlations a (c) 1/2 0.98. TSVR was an order of magnitude faster than the commonly used thinning methods. A third experiment applies a two-stage pipeline to TSVR, to accommodate online data. The pipeline subsets reconstruct the wind field with the same accuracy as the second experiment, is an order of magnitude faster than the nonpipeline TSVR. Therefore, pipeline TSVR is two orders of magnitude faster than commonly used thinning methods that ingest the entire data set. This study demonstrates that TSVR pipeline thinning is an accurate and computationally efficient alternative to commonly used data selection techniques.

J	Zhang, DW; Xu, H; Su, ZC; Xu, YF				Zhang, Dongwen; Xu, Hua; Su, Zengcai; Xu, Yunfeng			Chinese comments sentiment classification based on word2vec and SVMperf	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sentiment classification; Word2vec; SVMperf; Semantic features	ONLINE REVIEWS	Since the booming development of e-commerce in the last decade, the researchers have begun to pay more attention to extract the valuable information from consumers comments. Sentiment classification, which focuses on classify the comments into positive class and negative class according to the polarity of sentiment, is one of the studies. Machine learning-based method for sentiment classification becomes mainstream due to its outstanding performance. Most of the existing researches are centered on the extraction of lexical features and syntactic features, while the semantic relationships between words are ignored. In this paper, in order to get the semantic features, we propoie a method for sentiment classification based on word2vec and SVMperf. Our research consists of two parts of work. First of all, we use word2vec to cluster the similar features for purpose of showing the capability of word2vec to capture the semantic features in selected domain and Chinese language. And then, we train and classify the comment texts using word2vec again and SVMperf. In the process, the lexicon-based and part-of-speech-based feature selection methods are respectively adopted to generate the training file. We conduct the experiments on the data set of Chinese comments on clothing products. The experimental results show the superior performance of our method in sentiment classification.

Since the seeds are evaluated in many areas for sowing and oilseed processing, they must be identified quickly and accurately for selection of a correct variety. An affordable method based on computer vision and machine learning was proposed to classify the seven rapeseed varieties. Different types of feature sets, feature models, and machine learning classifiers were investigated to obtain the best predictive model for rapeseed classification. The training and test sets were used to tune the model parameters during the training epochs by varying the complexity of the predictive models with grid-search and K-fold cross validation. After obtaining optimized models for each level of complexity, a dedicated validation set was used to validate predictive models. The developed computer vision system provided an overall accuracy rate of 99.24% for the best predictive model in discriminating rapeseed variety. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As ripeness is the main indicator for tomato quality from customers perspective, the determination of tomato ripeness stages is a basic industrial concern regarding tomato production in order to get high quality product. Automatic ripeness evaluation of tomato is an essential research topic as it may prove benefits in ensuring optimum yield of high quality product, this will increase the income because tomato is one of the most important crops in the world. This article presents an automated multi-class classification approach for tomato ripeness measurement and evaluation via investigating and classifying the different maturity/ripeness stages. The proposed approach uses color features for classifying tomato ripeness stages. The approach proposed in this article uses Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in addition to Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithms for feature extraction and classification, respectively. Experiments have been conducted on a dataset of total 250 images that has been used for both training and testing datasets with 10-fold cross validation. Experimental results showed that the proposed classification approach has obtained ripeness classification accuracy of 90.80%, using one-against-one (OAO) multi-class SVMs algorithm with linear kernel function, ripeness classification accuracy of 84.80% using one-against-all (OAA) multi-class SVMs algorithm with linear kernel function, and ripeness classification accuracy of 84% using LDA algorithm.

Predicting stock market index using fusion of machine learning techniques	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Artificial Neural Networks; Support Vector Regression; Random Forest; Stock market; Hybrid models	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CHAOS; MODEL	The paper focuses on the task of predicting future values of stock market index. Two indices namely CNX Nifty and S&P Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex from Indian stock markets are selected for experimental evaluation. Experiments are based on 10 years of historical data of these two indices. The predictions are made for 1-10, 15 and 30 days in advance. The paper proposes two stage fusion approach involving Support Vector Regression (SVR) in the first stage. The second stage of the fusion approach uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF) and SVR resulting into SVR-ANN, SVR-RF and SVR-SVR fusion prediction models. The prediction performance of these hybrid models is compared with the single stage scenarios where ANN, RF and SVR are used single-handedly. Ten technical indicators are selected as the inputs to each of the prediction models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nguyen, T; Khosravi, A; Creighton, D; Nahavandi, S				Thanh Nguyen; Khosravi, Abbas; Creighton, Douglas; Nahavandi, Saeid			Classification of healthcare data using genetic fuzzy logic system and wavelets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fuzzy standard additive model; Genetic algorithm; Wavelet transformation; Healthcare data classification; Breast cancer; Heart disease	FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MAPS	Healthcare plays an important role in promoting the general health and well-being of people around the world. The difficulty in healthcare data classification arises from the uncertainty and the high-dimensional nature of the medical data collected. This paper proposes an integration of fuzzy standard additive model (SAM) with genetic algorithm (GA), called GSAM, to deal with uncertainty and computational challenges. GSAM learning process comprises three continual steps: rule initialization by unsupervised learning using the adaptive vector quantization clustering, evolutionary rule optimization by GA and parameter tuning by the gradient descent supervised learning. Wavelet transformation is employed to extract discriminative features for high-dimensional datasets. GSAM becomes highly capable when deployed with small number of wavelet features as its computational burden is remarkably reduced. The proposed method is evaluated using two frequently-used medical datasets: the Wisconsin breast cancer and Cleveland heart disease from the UCI Repository for machine learning. Experiments are organized with a five-fold cross validation and performance of classification techniques are measured by a number of important metrics: accuracy, F-measure, mutual information and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results demonstrate the superiority of the GSAM compared to other machine learning methods including probabilistic neural network, support vector machine, fuzzy ART-MAP, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. The proposed approach is thus helpful as a decision support system for medical practitioners in the healthcare practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Combining the products of multiple sensors is hypothesized to improve the estimation of forest biomass. We applied interferometric (Tandem-X) and photogrammetric (WorldView-2) based predictors, e.g. canopy height models, in combination with hyperspectral predictors (EO1-Hyperion) by using 4 different machine learning algorithms for biomass estimation in temperate forest stands near Karlsruhe, Germany. An iterative model selection procedure was used to identify the optimal combination of predictors. The most accurate model (Random Forest) reached a r(2) of 0.73 with a RMSE of 14.9% (29.4 t/ha). Further results revealed that the predictive accuracy depended highly on the statistical model and the area size of the field samples. We conclude that a fusion of canopy height and spectral information allows for accurate estimations of forest biomass from space. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The framework presents an iterative algorithm for learning the cyclic characteristics by introducing the discriminative frequency bands (DFBs) using the discriminant analysis along with k-means clustering method. The DEBs are employed by a hybrid model for learning dynamic characteristics of the time series within the cycles, using statistical and structural machine learning techniques. The framework offers a systematic procedure for finding the optimal design parameters associated with the hybrid model. The proposed model is optimized to detect the changes of the heart sound recordings (HSRs) related to aortic stenosis. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides efficient tools for the classification of the HSRs based on the heart murmurs. It is also evidenced that the hybrid model, proposed by the framework, substantially improves the classification performance when it comes to detection of the heart disease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we propose to study the morphological differences between male and female faces by analyzing the averageness and symmetry of their 3D shapes. In particular, we address the following questions: (i) is there any relationship between gender and face averageness/symmetry? and (ii) if this relationship exists, which specific areas on the face are involved? To this end, we propose first to capture densely both the face shape averageness (AVE) and symmetry (SYM) using our Dense Scalar Field (DSF), which denotes the shooting directions of geodesics between facial shapes. Then, we explore such representations by using classical machine learning techniques, the Feature Selection (FS) methods and Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. Experiments conducted on the FRGCv2 dataset show that a significant relationship exists between gender and facial averageness/symmetry when achieving a classification rate of 93.7% on the 466 earliest scans of subjects (mainly neutral) and 92.4% on the whole FRGCv2 dataset (including facial expressions).

J	Heger, J; Hildebrandt, T; Scholz-Reiter, B				Heger, Jens; Hildebrandt, Torsten; Scholz-Reiter, Bernd			Dispatching rule selection with Gaussian processes	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Planning and scheduling; Dispatching rules; Machine learning; Gaussian processes; Production management and logistics	JOB-SHOP; REGRESSION; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	Decentralized scheduling with dispatching rules is applied in many fields of logistics and production, especially in highly complex and dynamic scenarios, such as semiconductor manufacturing. Many dispatching rules are proposed in the literature, which perform well on specific scenarios. No rule is known, however, consistently outperforming all other rules. One approach to meet this challenge and improve scheduling performance is to select and switch dispatching rules depending on current system conditions. For this task machine learning techniques (e.g., Artificial Neural Networks) are frequently used. In this paper we investigate the use of a machine learning technique not applied to this task before: Gaussian process regression. Our analysis shows that Gaussian processes predict dispatching rule performance better than Neural Networks in most settings. Additionally, already a single Gaussian Process model can easily provide a measure of prediction quality. This is in contrast to many other machine learning techniques. We show how to use this measure to dynamically add additional training data and incrementally improve the model where necessary. Results therefore suggest, Gaussian processes are a very promising technique, which can lead to better scheduling performance (e.g., reduced mean tardiness) compared to other techniques.

In Europe, only the European Union normalization factors (EU NFs), with 2000 as the reference year, are available for LCA practitioners, although they work on a regional level. The hypothesis of this research was based on the assumption that some regional NFs deviate from the EU NFs due to unique regional profiles, or because of previously omitted or generalized human impact. In this particular case study set in Slovenia has been tested. By working on the ReCiPe 1.08 life cycle impact assessment methodology, 18 impact categories were investigated, and an additional 3 were added: electromagnetic radiation, light pollution and electric use. To meet practitioners' needs, the most up-to-date inventory data was used with the reference years of 2007-2012. Out of 440 environmental interventions that were investigated, 139 had no characterization factors (CFs), 97 were estimated using machine learning and 42 had to be omitted. The final result confirmed our hypothesis. Twenty NFs were compared with the EU NFs, and the results have shown that on average, the NFs differ by a factor of 9.76 (median = 1.65). The reasons for the high deviation are due to natural land transformation, and ionising radiation, toxicological and ecotoxicological impact categories; where there are major data gaps in the CFs. The primary concern of the research was data availability for toxicological and ecotoxicological parameters for toxicity-related emissions, and the fact that original CFs covered only 50.25% of plant protection products used in Slovenia. Toxicological and ecotoxicological uncertainties were illustrated by comparing four different results. Future studies should be focused on the use of machine learning to provide the next generation of CFs and to go beyond the CFs' damage-oriented assessment. Remediation should be the new endpoint category and its units should be joules. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The virus infects 35 million people globally and after 30 years, the disease remains a challenge. Despite great efforts in finding efficient treatment strategies, the pandemic of AIDS is continuing and the rate of new infections has not been diminished. Therefore, the need for finding novel treatment strategies is still of great importance. Peptide-based therapeutics has shown promise in the treatment of many challenging diseases such as various types of cancers and also HIV. Since time and money are the two restricting factors in any experimental researches, computer-aided techniques can dramatically reduce time and costs. In the present study, we developed a method based on pseudo amino acid composition of amino acid sequences to classify the anti-HIV-1 peptides using different machine learning algorithms. The performance of each algorithm was investigated and after comparing the performance parameters, the most accurate algorithm was proposed for predicting anti-HIV-1 activity of any given peptide. Having the accuracies of 96.15 and 83.71 % respectively, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and logistic model tree algorithms were primarily shown to be the most accurate ones in classifying anti-HIV-1 peptides.

An innovative mesoscopic vehicular consumption model that is based on machine learning functionality is introduced and its application in a case study involving Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs) is examined. The integration of this model in a routing engine especially designed for FEVs is also analyzed and a software architecture for implementing the proposed routing methodology is defined. In order to verify the robustness and the energy efficiency of this methodology, a system prototype has been developed and a series of field tests have been performed. The results of these tests are reported and significant conclusions are derived regarding the generated energy efficient routes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is one of the criteria practiced in automated text categorization. Machine learning (ML) based methods are the popular solution for this problem. However, the developed models typically provide low expressivity and lacking in human-understandable representation. In spite of being highly efficient, the ML based methods are established in train-test setting, and when the existing model is found insufficient, the whole processes need to be reinvented which implies train-test-retrain and is typically time consuming. Furthermore, retraining the model is not usually practical and feasible option whenever there is continuous change. This paper introduces the evolving fuzzy grammar (EFG) method for crime texts categorization. In this method, the learning model is built based on a set of selected text fragments which are then transformed into their underlying structure called fuzzy grammars. The fuzzy notion is used because the grammar matching, parsing and derivation involve uncertainty. Fuzzy union operator is also used to combine and transform individual text fragment grammars into more general representations of the learned text fragments. The set of learned fuzzy grammars is influenced by the evolution in the seen pattern; the learned model is slightly changed (incrementally) as adaptation, which does not require the conventional redevelopment. The performance of EFG in crime texts categorization is evaluated against expert-tagged real incidents summaries and compared against C4.5, support vector machines, naive Bayes, boosting, and k-nearest neighbour methods. Results show that the EFG algorithm produces results that are close in performance with the other ML methods while being highly interpretable, easily integrated into a more comprehensive grammar system and with lower model retraining adaptability time.

J	Dai, Q; Zhang, T; Liu, NZ				Dai, Qun; Zhang, Ting; Liu, Ningzhong			A new reverse reduce-error ensemble pruning algorithm	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Neural network ensemble; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Classifier; Reduce-Error (RE) pruning; Reverse Reduce-Error (RRE) pruning	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; SYSTEMS; RULE	Although greedy algorithms possess high efficiency, they often receive suboptimal solutions of the ensemble pruning problem, since their exploration areas are limited in large extent. And another marked defect of almost all the currently existing ensemble pruning algorithms, including greedy ones, consists in: they simply abandon all of the classifiers which fail in the competition of ensemble selection, causing a considerable waste of useful resources and information. Inspired by these observations, an interesting greedy Reverse Reduce-Error (RRE) pruning algorithm incorporated with the operation of subtraction is proposed in this work. The RRE algorithm makes the best of the defeated candidate networks in a way that, the Worst Single Model (WSM) is chosen, and then, its votes are subtracted from the votes made by those selected components within the pruned ensemble. The reason is because, for most cases, the WSM might make mistakes in its estimation for the test samples. And, different from the classical RE, the near-optimal solution is produced based on the pruned error of all the available sequential subensembles. Besides, the backfitting step of RE algorithm is replaced with the selection step of a WSM in RRE. Moreover, the problem of ties might be solved more naturally with RRE. Finally, soft voting approach is employed in the testing to RRE algorithm. The performances of RE and RRE algorithms, and two baseline methods, i.e., the method which selects the Best Single Model (BSM) in the initial ensemble, and the method which retains all member networks of the initial ensemble (ALL), are evaluated on seven benchmark classification tasks under different initial ensemble setups. The results of the empirical investigation show the superiority of RRE over the other three ensemble pruning algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreno			Solving the minimum labelling spanning tree problem by intelligent optimization	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Combinatorial optimization; Graphs and networks; Minimum labelling spanning trees; Intelligent optimization; Hybrid methods; Variable neighbourhood search	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; METAHEURISTICS; CLASSIFIERS; ALGORITHM; BEHAVIOR	Research on intelligent optimization is concerned with developing algorithms in which the optimization process is guided by an "intelligent agent", whose role is to deal with algorithmic issues such as parameters tuning, adaptation, and combination of different existing optimization techniques, with the aim of improving the efficiency and robustness of the optimization process. This paper proposes an intelligent optimization approach to solve the minimum labelling spanning tree (MLST) problem. The MLST problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where, given a connected, undirected graph whose edges are labelled (or coloured), the aim is to find a spanning tree whose edges have the smallest number of distinct labels (or colours). In recent work, the MLST problem has been shown to be NP-hard and some effective metaheuristics have been proposed and analysed. The intelligent optimization algorithm proposed here integrates the basic variable neighbourhood search heuristic with other complementary approaches from machine learning, statistics and experimental soft computing, in order to produce high-quality performance and to completely automate the resulting optimization strategy. We present experimental results on randomly generated graphs with different statistical properties, and demonstrate the implementation, the robustness, and the empirical scalability of our intelligent local search. Our computational experiments show that the proposed strategy outperforms heuristics recommended in the literature and is able to obtain high quality solutions quickly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In present study, we assessed the toxicity of more than 663 diverse chemicals on 17 avian species. All the chemicals were classified into three categories, i.e. highly toxic, slightly toxic and non-toxic, based on the toxicity classification criteria of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). To evaluate these chemicals, the toxicity prediction models were built using chemical category approaches with molecular descriptors and five commonly used fingerprints, in which five machine learning methods were performed on two standard test species: aquatic bird mallard duck and terrestrial bird northern bobwhite quail. The support vector machine (SVM) method with Pubchem fingerprint performed best as revealed by 5-fold cross-validation and the external validation set on Japanese quail. No species difference existed in our database despite several chemicals with different toxicity on some avian species. The best model had an overall accuracy at 0.851 for the prediction of toxicity on avian species, which outperformed the work of Mazzatorta et al. Furthermore, several representative substructures for characterizing avian toxicity were identified via information gain (IG) method. This study would provide a new tool for chemical safety assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Machine learning methods were applied to all public mentions of bullying on Twitter between September 1, 2011 and August 31, 2013 to extract the posts that referred to discrete bullying episodes (N = 9,764,583) to address five key questions. Most posts were authored by victims and reporters and referred to general forms of bullying. Posts frequently reflected self-disclosure about personal involvement in bullying. The number of posts that originated from a state was positively associated with the state population size; the timing of the posts reveal that more posts were made on weekdays than on Saturdays and more posts were made during the evening compared to daytime hours. Potential benefits of merging social science and computer science methods to enhance the study of bullying are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The algorithm iteratively tries to find modes of an estimated probability density function. These modes play an important role in many applications, such as clustering, image segmentation, feature extraction, and object tracking. The modes are fixed points of a discrete, nonlinear dynamical system. Although the algorithm has been successfully used in many applications, a theoretical study of its convergence is still missing in the literature. In this paper, we first consider the iteration index as a continuous variable and, by introducing a Lyapunov function, show that the equilibrium points are asymptotically stable. We also show that the proposed function can be considered as a Lyapunov function for the discrete case with the isolated stationary points. The availability of a Lyapunov function for continuous and discrete cases shows that if the MS iterations start in a neighborhood of an equilibrium point, the generated sequence remains close to that equilibrium point and finally converges to it.

Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimization problem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual prox method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved, significantly faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an convergence rate. Our empirical studies verify the efficiency of the proposed method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods.

This will create unprecedented opportunities for a variety of environmental research fields and lead to manifold novel applications. These opportunities specifically apply to challenging environments, including heterogeneous urban landscapes. In this paper, we explored the potential of EnMAP data for quantifying land cover along the urban-rural gradient of Berlin, Germany. Land cover fraction maps from a simulated EnMAP scene at 30 m spatial resolution were derived based on support vector regression (SVR) combined with synthetically mixed training data. Results demonstrate that EnMAP imagery will be well suited for mapping impervious, vegetation and soil surface types according to the VIS framework. Moreover, EnMAP data will allow extending the VIS framework by more detailed sub-categories such as roof and pavement, or low vegetation and tree. However, we advise caution that spaceborne imaging spectrometer data of improved quality will not completely help to overcome well known phenomena of spectral similarity between materials and spectral confusion caused by the presence of shaded areas. To identify possible benefits and limitations of EnMAP data, comparisons to fraction maps derived from a higher resolution Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) image at 9 m spatial resolution and a multispectral Landsat ETM +-like image at 30 m spatial resolution were drawn. First, we demonstrate that both VIS and extended VIS mapping reveal similar accuracies compared to maps from spatially higher resolution data. Second, we illustrate the superiority of the higher spectral information content for improved and extended urban land cover mapping compared to multispectral data. Overall, this study provides important insights into the potential of spaceborne imaging spectrometer and specifically future EnMAP data for urban remote sensing.

J	Dronova, I; Gong, P; Wang, L; Zhong, LH				Dronova, Iryna; Gong, Peng; Wang, Lin; Zhong, Liheng			Mapping dynamic cover types in a large seasonally flooded wetland using extended principal component analysis and object-based classification	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Dynamic cover types; Wetland remote sensing; Object-based image analysis; PR China; Extended PCA; Phenology; Change trajectory analysis	LAND-USE CHANGE; POYANG LAKE; TIME-SERIES; CHANGE TRAJECTORIES; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; FUNCTIONAL TYPES; WATER INDEX; TM DATA; IMAGERY; INUNDATION	Periodically inundated wetlands with high short-term surface variation require special approaches to assess their composition and long-term change. To circumvent high uncertainty in single-date analyses of such areas, we propose to characterize them as dynamic cover types (DCTs), or sequences of wetland states and transitions informed by physically and ecologically plausible surface processes. This study delineated DCTs for one 2007-2008 flood cycle at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater wetland in China, using spatial and temporal orientation modes of extended principal components analysis (EPCA) and supervised object-based classification of multi-spectral and radar image series. Classification accuracy was compared among three sets of attributes selected by machine-learning optimization from object-level mean and standard deviations of: 1) image time series alone; 2) the most informative EPCA outputs alone and 3) image time series and EPCA results together. Classification uncertainty was additionally assessed as low values of object's maximum class membership (<0.5). The highest accuracy was achieved with a larger set of 33 attributes selected from combined time series and EPCA results (overall accuracy 95.0%, kappa 0.94); however, accuracies with smaller sets of variables from input image series or EPCA results alone were comparably high (93.1% and 94.7%, respectively). All three selected attribute sets included standard deviations of image and/or EPCA values, suggesting the utility of object texture in dynamic class discrimination. The highest classification uncertainty was observed primarily along the mapped class boundaries, in some cases indicating minor change trajectories for which prior reference data were not available. Results indicate that DCTs provide a reasonable classification framework for complex and variable Poyang Lake wetlands that can be facilitated by EPCA transformation of complementary remote sensing time series.

Detecting change in urban areas at continental scales with MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban areas; Urbanization; Cities; Land cover; Change detection; Classification; Machine learning; Decision trees; Data fusion; Decision fusion	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; NIGHTTIME LIGHT DATA; REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; TIME-SERIES; UNITED-STATES; URBANIZATION DYNAMICS; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE DATA; RESOLUTION; IMAGERY	Urbanization is one of the most important components of global environmental change, yet most of what we know about urban areas is at the local scale. Remote sensing of urban expansion across large areas provides information on the spatial and temporal patterns of growth that are essential for understanding differences in socioeconomic and political factors that spur different forms of development, as well the social, environmental, and climatic impacts that result. However, mapping urban expansion globally is challenging: urban areas have a small footprint compared to other land cover types, their features are small, they are heterogeneous in both material composition and configuration, and the form and rates of new development are often highly variable across locations. Here we demonstrate a methodology for monitoring urban land expansion at continental to global scales using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The new method focuses on resolving the spectral and temporal ambiguities between urban/non-urban land and stable/changed areas by: (1) spatially constraining the study extent to known locations of urban land; (2) integrating multi-temporal data from multiple satellite data sources to classify c. 2010 urban extent; and (3) mapping newly built areas (2000-2010) within the 2010 urban land extent using a multi-temporal composite change detection approach based on MODIS 250 m annual maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI). We test the method in 15 countries in East-Southeast Asia experiencing different rates and manifestations of urban expansion. A two-tiered accuracy assessment shows that the approach characterizes urban change across a variety of socioeconomic/political and ecological/climatic conditions with good accuracy (70-91% overall accuracy by country, 69-89% by biome). The 250 m EVI data not only improve the classification results, but are capable of distinguishing between change and no-change areas in urban areas. Over 80% of the error in the change detection can be related to definitional issues or error propagation, rather than algorithm error. As such, these methods hold great potential for routine monitoring of urban change, as well as for providing a consistent and up-todate dataset on urban extent and expansion for a rapidly evolving region.

The two solutions are online and offline polynomial regression modeling. In the former solution, the regression model is built during the decoding process, while in the latter solution, the model is built during the encoding or the transcoding process and then used at the decoder for concealment. Both solutions make use of the spatially and temporally neighboring MVs for building the regression models. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solutions are elaborated upon. In comparison with existing work, the experimental results show that the proposed solutions have clear advantages of computational time requirements and MV prediction accuracy.

To exploit frequency diversity in Wi-Fi channels, the access point should measure the channel quality and coordinate the channel contention for all the stations. However, there is a tradeoff between achieving the frequency diversity gain and sustaining protocol efficiency because the channel estimation and coordination consume time and frequency resource that ideally should be used for data transfer. In this paper, we present Diversity-aware Wi-Fi (D-Fi), a novel PHY/MAC protocol, that efficiently exploits frequency diversity. In particular, D-Fi leverages an OFDM-based Bloom filter that synergistically integrates two operations: (i) the channel quality estimation and (ii) the contention based channel allocation. D-Fi also employs a machine learning (ML) method to resolve the false-positive ambiguity caused by the Bloom filter. Furthermore, we develop a decentralized algorithm, called K epsilon-greedy, based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework, so that it achieves sub-optimal performance by studying the gain for exploring new channel quality information. We implement the prototype of D-Fi on the USRP/GNU Radio to validate the feasibility of our work. The experiments and trace-driven simulations show that D-Fi provides up to 3 x throughput improvement compared to the existing solutions.

Prediction of hospitalization due to heart diseases by supervised learning methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Prevention; Predictive models; Hospitalization; Heart diseases; Machine learning; Electronic Health Records (EHRs)	ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; PRIMARY-CARE; RISK	Background: In 2008, the United States spent $2.2 trillion for healthcare, which was 15.5% of its GDP. 31% of this expenditure is attributed to hospital care. Evidently, even modest reductions in hospital care costs matter. A 2009 study showed that nearly $30.8 billion in hospital care cost during 2006 was potentially preventable, with heart diseases being responsible for about 31% of that amount. Methods: Our goal is to accurately and efficiently predict heart-related hospitalizations based on the available patient-specific medical history. To the best of our knowledge, the approaches we introduce are novel for this problem. The prediction of hospitalization is formulated as a supervised classification problem. We use de-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from a large urban hospital in Boston to identify patients with heart diseases. Patients are labeled and randomly partitioned into a training and a test set. We apply five machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost using trees as the weak learner, logistic regression, a naive Bayes event classifier, and a variation of a Likelihood Ratio Test adapted to the specific problem. Each model is trained on the training set and then tested on the test set. Results: All five models show consistent results, which could, to some extent, indicate the limit of the achievable prediction accuracy. Our results show that with under 30% false alarm rate, the detection rate could be as high as 82%. These accuracy rates translate to a considerable amount of potential savings, if used in practice.

On the basis of the assessment of the dermal epidermal junction (DEJ) and morphologic features in its vicinity, skin cancer can be diagnosed in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity. However, the current visual, qualitative approach for reading images leads to subjective variability in diagnosis. We hypothesize that machine learning based algorithms may enable a more quantitative, objective approach. Testing and validation were performed with two algorithms that can automatically delineate the DEJ in RCM stacks of normal human skin. The test set was composed of 15 fair- and 15 dark-skin stacks (30 subjects) with expert labelings. In dark skin, in which the contrast is high owing to melanin, the algorithm produced an average error of 7.9 +/- 6.4 mu m. In fair skin, the algorithm delineated the DEJ as a transition zone, with average error of 8.3 +/- 5.8 mu m for the epidermis-to-transition zone boundary and 7.6 +/- 5.6 mu m for the transition zone-to-dermis. Our results suggest that automated algorithms may quantitatively guide the delineation of the DEJ, to assist in objective reading of RCM images. Further development of such algorithms may guide assessment of abnormal morphological features at the DEJ.

The techniques for predicting project duration are most often based on expert judgment and mathematical models, such as statistical regression or machine learning. The contribution of this study is to investigate whether or not the duration prediction accuracy obtained with a multilayer feedforward neural network model, also called a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and with a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model is statistically better than that obtained by a multiple linear regression (MLR) model when functional size and the maximum size of the team of developers are used as the independent variables. The three models mentioned above are trained and tested by predicting the duration of new software development projects with a'set of projects from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) release 11. Results based on absolute residuals, Pred(I) and a Friedman statistical test show that prediction accuracy with the MLP and the RBFNN is statistically better than with the MLR model.

Nowadays, it is common to have blockbuster quality games, with realistic graphics and engaging stories. Despite this, the progress made in incorporating Artificial Intelligence has been slow, and realistic human-like intelligence in games is hardly to be found. There have been some attempts to use Machine Learning in games, but such attempts often ended up impractical or affecting the players enjoyment due to several constraining factors. In this paper, we describe Meme War as a proof-of-concept for practical usage of Machine Learning in games. We introduce Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as one approach to achieve a better experience in employing Machine Learning in games. Advantages of ELM over Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) are presented in terms of what ELM can offer in a practical point of view of the player.

Besides the obvious need for ethological research, both in the field and in the laboratory, the possible information content of barks can also be explored by computerized acoustic analyses. This study compares four different supervised learning methods (naive Bayes, classification trees, -nearest neighbors and logistic regression) combined with three strategies for selecting variables (all variables, filter and wrapper feature subset selections) to classify Mudi dogs by sex, age, context and individual from their barks. The classification accuracy of the models obtained was estimated by means of -fold cross-validation. Percentages of correct classifications were 85.13 % for determining sex, 80.25 % for predicting age (recodified as young, adult and old), 55.50 % for classifying contexts (seven situations) and 67.63 % for recognizing individuals (8 dogs), so the results are encouraging. The best-performing method was -nearest neighbors following a wrapper feature selection approach. The results for classifying contexts and recognizing individual dogs were better with this method than they were for other approaches reported in the specialized literature. This is the first time that the sex and age of domestic dogs have been predicted with the help of sound analysis. This study shows that dog barks carry ample information regarding the caller's indexical features. Our computerized analysis provides indirect proof that barks may serve as an important source of information for dogs as well.

However, PCR amplification of these marker genes produces a significant amount of artificial sequences, often referred to as chimeras. Different algorithms have been developed to remove these chimeras, but efforts to combine different methodologies are limited. Therefore, two machine learning classifiers (reference-based and de novo CATCh) were developed by integrating the output of existing chimera detection tools into a new, more powerful method. When comparing our classifiers with existing tools in either the reference-based or de novo mode, a higher performance of our ensemble method was observed on a wide range of sequencing data, including simulated, 454 pyrosequencing, and Illumina MiSeq data sets. Since our algorithm combines the advantages of different individual chimera detection tools, our approach produces more robust results when challenged with chimeric sequences having a low parent divergence, short length of the chimeric range, and various numbers of parents. Additionally, it could be shown that integrating CATCh in the preprocessing pipeline has a beneficial effect on the quality of the clustering in operational taxonomic units.

One of the main obstacles for their wide usage is that, when set-valued features are allowed, their basic operations (subsumption, unification, and antiunification) have a very high computational cost. We present a Constraint Programming formulation of these operations, which in some cases provides orders of magnitude speed-ups with respect to the standard approaches. In addition, exploiting several symmetries that often appear in feature terms databases causes substantial additional savings. We provide experimental results of the benefits of this approach.

Calibration of such models is often performed using comparatively standard 'off-the-shelf' machine-learning algorithms that are not necessarily suited to perform effectively within the model's implementation. This method becomes problematic when the computational costs of applying an evaluation function to determine the goodness-of-fit are high; calibration using 'standard' algorithms often requires many iterations to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Furthermore, in some cases, future LULC projections manifest significant changes in trends, particularly when increasing the number of LULC classes in the simulation and the number of associated transition rules. This study presents an adapted machine-learning algorithm to optimize a parameter set applied in a Dinamica-EGO-based LULC change model. A sequentially applied memetic algorithm is applied to optimize a vast parameter set by extending a genetic algorithm with a local search function. To achieve consistent long-term projections, a 2-stage approach is applied in which the expansion of the urban extent and diversification of urban LULC classes are calculated sequentially. The outcomes repeatedly show a much faster convergence toward a high goodness-of-fit; significantly fewer iterations and a smaller population size can be used to attain a similar performance level than when using a standard GA-enhanced calibration. Furthermore, the observed spatial trends are maintained for long-term projections using 5-year intervals. In the current application, the model is applied to the rapidly growing metropolitan area of Beijing, China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Approximate symmetrical confidence intervals constructed by the F-1 value based on cross-validated t distribution are commonly used in the literature. However, theoretical analysis on the distribution of F-1 values shows that such distribution is actually non-symmetrical. Thus, simply using symmetrical distribution to approximate non-symmetrical distribution may be inappropriate and may result in a low degree of confidence and long interval length for the confidence interval. In the present study, a non-symmetrical confidence interval of the F-1 measure based on Beta prime distribution is constructed by using the F-1 value computed based on the average confusion matrix of a blocked 3 x 2 cross-validation. Experimental results show that in most cases, our method has high degrees of confidence. With an acceptable degree of confidence, our method has a shorter interval length than the approximate symmetrical confidence intervals based on the blocked 3 x 2 and 5 x 2 cross-validated t distributions. The approximate symmetrical confidence interval based on the 10-fold cross-validated t distribution has the shortest interval length of the four confidence intervals but with low degrees of confidence in all cases. Taking these two factors into consideration, our method is recommended.

The use of counter-vandalism bots is changing the way Wikipedia identifies and bans vandals, but their contributions are often not considered nor discussed. In this paper, we propose novel text features capturing the invariants of vandalism across five languages to learn and compare the contributions of bots and users in the task of identifying vandalism. We construct computationally efficient features that highlight the contributions of bots and users, and generalize across languages. We evaluate our proposed features through classification performance on revisions of five Wikipedia languages, totaling over 500 million revisions of over nine million articles. As a comparison, we evaluate these features on the small PAN Wikipedia vandalism data sets, used by previous research, which contain approximately 62,000 revisions. We show differences in the performance of our features on the PAN and the full Wikipedia data set. With the appropriate text features, vandalism bots can be effective across different languages while learning from only one language. Our ultimate aim is to build the next generation of vandalism detection bots based on machine learning approaches that can work effectively across many languages.

We call such graphs weighted attribute graphs (WAGs). Nodes of a WAG exhibit multiple attributes with varying, non-negative weights. WAGs are ubiquitous in real-world applications. For example, in a co-authorship WAG, each author is a node; each attribute corresponds to a particular topic (e.g., databases, data mining, and machine learning); and the amount of expertise in a particular topic is represented by a non-negative weight on that attribute. A typical search in this setting specifies both connectivity between nodes and constraints on weights of nodal attributes. For example, a user's search may be: find three coauthors (i.e., a triangle) where each author's expertise is greater than 50 percent in at least one topic area (i.e., attribute). We propose a ranking function which unifies ranking between the graph structure and attribute weights of nodes. We prove that the problem of retrieving the optimal answer for graph search on WAGs is NP-complete. Moreover, we propose a fast and effective top-k graph search algorithm for WAGs. In an extensive experimental study with multiple real-world graphs, our proposed algorithm exhibits significant speed-up over competing approaches. On average, our proposed method is more than 7x faster in query processing than the best competitor.

Reliable Feature Selection for Automated Angle Closure Glaucoma Mechanism Detection	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Angle-closure glaucoma; Feature selection; Rank combination method; Adaboost classifier; Machine learning	OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; DIAGNOSIS	Glaucoma is an eye disease where a loss of vision occurs as a result of progressive optic nerve damage usually associates with high intraocular pressure. A subtype of glaucoma called primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) has been observed to be the result of one or more mechanisms such as Pupil block, Plateau iris, Peripheral iris roll, and Lens in the anterior segment of the eye. Reliable features in anterior segment images are important for determining the specific mechanisms involved in PACG. In this paper, first the discriminant features are selected by several feature selection algorithms in the context of PACG detection based on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images, and then a novel criteria is proposed to further select more reliable features. Our approach is based on selecting the top-ranked features in each algorithm and its rank combination for selection of the best features. Compared with the features selected by the individual feature selection methods, the features selected by our method achieves the best performance in terms of the accuracy of classification of the four PACG mechanisms by using AdaBoost classifier.

The standard low-rank matrix completion methods relax the rank minimization problem by the trace norm minimization. However, this relaxation may make the solution seriously deviate from the original solution. Meanwhile, most completion methods minimize the squared prediction errors on the observed entries, which is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose a new robust matrix completion method to address these two problems. The joint Schatten -norm and -norm are used to better approximate the rank minimization problem and enhance the robustness to outliers. The extensive experiments are performed on both synthetic data and real-world applications in collaborative filtering prediction and social network link recovery. All empirical results show that our new method outperforms the standard matrix completion methods.

In order to improve the internal quality of a software system, identifying faulty entities such as classes, modules, methods is essential for software developers. As defective software entities are hard to identify, machine learning-based classification models are still developed to approach the problem of detecting software design defects. We are proposing a novel method based on relational association rule mining for detecting faulty entities in existing software systems. Relational association rules are a particular type of association rules and describe numerical orderings between attributes that commonly occur over a dataset. Our method is based on the discovery of relational association rules for identifying design defects in software. Experiments on open source software are conducted in order to detect defective classes in object-oriented software systems, and a comparison of our approach with similar existing approaches is provided. The obtained results show that our method is effective for software design defect detection and confirms the potential of our proposal.

We designed a multilayered back-propagation algorithm-based artificial neural network for gait pattern classification and we compared the results obtained with those produced using the k-means and k-nearest neighbor algorithms. A novel aspect of our feature extraction procedure was the use of a kernel-based principal components analysis because the captured real-time data exhibited significant nonlinearity. The gait data were classified into four classes: normal, crouch-2, crouch-3, and crouch-4. The proposed method achieved gait identification with very good activity recognition accuracy (ARA). The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methodology could recognize different activities accurately in outdoor and indoor environments, while maintaining a high ARA. The identification of disordered or abnormal gait patterns was the fundamental aim of this study. Thus, we propose a method for the early detection of abnormal gait patterns, which can provide warnings about the potential development of diseases related to human walking. Furthermore, this gait-based biometric identification method can be utilized in the detection of gender, age, race, and for authentication purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Prediction solely based on the hippocampus may be hampered by widespread mesiotemporal structural damage shown by advanced imaging. Increasingly complex and high-dimensional representation of MRI metrics motivates a shift to machine learning to establish objective, data-driven criteria for pathogenic processes and prognosis. MethodsWe applied clustering to 114 consecutive unilateral TLE patients using 1.5T MRI profiles derived from surface morphology of hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. To evaluate the diagnostic validity of the classification, we assessed its yield to predict outcome in 79 surgically treated patients. Reproducibility of outcome prediction was assessed in an independent cohort of 27 patients evaluated on 3.0T MRI. ResultsFour similarly sized classes partitioned our cohort; in all, alterations spanned over the 3 mesiotemporal structures. Compared to 46 controls, TLE-I showed marked bilateral atrophy; in TLE-II atrophy was ipsilateral; TLE-III showed mild bilateral atrophy; whereas TLE-IV showed hypertrophy. Classes differed with regard to histopathology and freedom from seizures. Classwise surface-based classifiers accurately predicted outcome in 921% of patients, outperforming conventional volumetry. Predictors of relapse were distributed bilaterally across structures. Prediction accuracy was similarly high in the independent cohort (96%), supporting generalizability. InterpretationWe provide a novel description of individual variability across the TLE spectrum. Class membership was associated with distinct patterns of damage and outcome predictors that did not spatially overlap, emphasizing the ability of machine learning to disentangle the differential contribution of morphology to patient phenotypes, ultimately refining the prognosis of epilepsy surgery.

However, the results of these studies are based on group-level statistics and therefore it is unclear whether PTSD can be discriminated at single-subject level, for instance using the machine learning approach. Here, we proposed a novel framework to identify PTSD using multi-level measures derived from resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). Specifically, three levels of measures were extracted as classification features: (1) regional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (univariate feature), which represents local spontaneous synchronous neural activity; (2) temporal functional connectivity (bivariate feature), which represents the extent of similarity of local activity between two regions, and (3) spatial functional connectivity (multivariate feature), which represents the extent of similarity of temporal correlation maps between two regions. Our method was evaluated on 20 PTSD patients and 20 demographically matched healthy controls. The experimental results showed that the features of each level could successfully discriminate PTSD patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, the combination of multi-level features using multi-kernel learning can further improve the classification performance. Specifically, the classification accuracy obtained by the proposed framework was 92.5 %, which was an increase of at least 5 and 17.5 % from the two-level and single-level feature based methods, respectively. Particularly, the limbic structure and prefrontal cortex provided the most discriminant features for classification, consistent with results reported in previous studies. Together, this study demonstrated for the first time that patients with PTSD can be identified at the individual level using resting-state fMRI data. The promising classification results indicated that this method may provide a complementary approach for improving the clinical diagnosis of PTSD.

At the same time, the access to such data and the tools needed to process them has considerably improved. In the presence of such data flow, we need automatic image interpretation methods, especially when it comes to the monitoring and prediction of environmental and societal changes in highly dynamic socio-environmental contexts. This could be accomplished via artificial intelligence. The concept described here relies on the induction of classification rules that explicitly take into account structural knowledge, using Aleph, an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system, combined with a multi-class classification procedure. This methodology was used to monitor changes in land cover/use of the French Guiana coastline. One hundred and fifty-eight classification rules were induced from 3 diachronic land cover/use maps including 38 classes. These rules were expressed in first order logic language, which makes them easily understandable by non-experts. A 10-fold cross-validation gave significant average values of 84.62%, 99.57% and 77.22% for classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Our methodology could be beneficial to automatically classify new objects and to facilitate object-based classification procedures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using them, we develop an algorithm-that we call "exponential weight approachability"aEuro"bounding the distance of average vector payoffs to some product set, with a logarithmic dependency in the dimension of the ambient space. The classic strategy of Blackwell would get instead a polynomial dependency. This result has important consequences, in several frameworks that emerged both in game theory and machine learning. The most striking application is the construction of algorithms that are calibrated with respect to the family of all balls (we treat in details the case of the uniform norm), with dimension independent and optimal, up to logarithmic factors, rates of convergence. Calibration can also be achieved with respect to all Borel sets, covering and improving the previously known results. Exponential weight approachability can also be used to design an optimal and natural algorithm that minimizes refined notions of regret.

Novel data condensing method using a prototype's front propagation algorithm	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data classification; Machine learning; Data prototypes; KNN	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; REDUCTION; ABSTRACTION	This work proposes a method for data condensing. The method is based on the selection of a generator of data prototypes. An algorithm for the front propagation of the prototypes' boundaries is performed in order to obtain the class boundaries given by a set of support vectors. The proposed method just has one tuning parameter and presents high classification rates even for complex topological and non-concave classes and low tendency to over-fitting. The most important advantage of the proposed method is its higher condensing rate without a significant detrimental effect on the classification rate. The algorithm is intended to be applied for condensing data in low memory devices and transmission of high-volume of data where data condensing could be crucial. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we validate the previous model with new additional data points expanding the chemical space and use that data also to renew the model. The model building process was similar to our previous approach; however, a new set of descriptors, molecular signatures, was included to facilitate the model interpretation from a structure perspective. The best consensus model shows better predictive power than the previous model (R-2 = 0.6 vs. R-2 = 0.53, when the same 99 compounds were used as test set). The two-class classification accuracy increased from 76% using the previous model to 81%. Furthermore, the atom-summarized gradient based on molecular signature descriptors was proposed as an interesting new approach to interpret the K-p,K-uu,K-brain machine learning model and scrutinize structure K-p,K-uu,K-brain relationships for investigated compounds.

The aim of our study was to apply the machine-learning algorithm ranking instances by maximizing the area under the ROC curve (RIMARC) to a large data set of 480 APs combined with retrospectively collected general clinical parameters and to test whether the rules learned by the RIMARC algorithm can be used for accurately classifying the preoperative rhythm status. APs were included from 221 SR and 158 AF patients. During a learning phase, the RIMARC algorithm established a ranking order of 62 features by predictive value for SR or AF. The model was then challenged with an additional test set of features from 28 patients in whom rhythm status was blinded. The accuracy of the risk prediction for AF by the model was very good (0.93) when all features were used. Without the seven AP features, accuracy still reached 0.71. In conclusion, we have shown that training the machine-learning algorithm RIMARC with an experimental and clinical data set allows predicting a classification in a test data set with high accuracy. In a clinical setting, this approach may prove useful for finding hypothesis-generating associations between different parameters.

Identifying transcriptional cis-regulatory modules in animal genomes	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material							DNA-BINDING SPECIFICITY; CONSERVED NONCODING SEQUENCES; INDUCIBLE GENE-EXPRESSION; ENHANCER ACTIVITY MAPS; DE-NOVO DISCOVERY; IN-VIVO; DEVELOPMENTAL ENHANCERS; MAMMALIAN ENHANCERS; CHIP-SEQ; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER	Gene expression is regulated through the activity of transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin-modifying proteins acting on specific DNA sequences, referred to as cis-regulatory elements. These include promoters, located at the transcription initiation sites of genes, and a variety of distal cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), the most common of which are transcriptional enhancers. Because regulated gene expression is fundamental to cell differentiation and acquisition of new cell fates, identifying, characterizing, and understanding the mechanisms of action of CRMs is critical for understanding development. CRM discovery has historically been challenging, as CRMs can be located far from the genes they regulate, have few readily identifiable sequence characteristics, and for many years were not amenable to high-throughput discovery methods. However, the recent availability of complete genome sequences and the development of next-generation sequencing methods have led to an explosion of both computational and empirical methods for CRM discovery in model and nonmodel organisms alike. Experimentally, CRMs can be identified through chromatin immunoprecipitation directed against TFs or histone post-translational modifications, identification of nucleosome-depleted open' chromatin regions, or sequencing-based high-throughput functional screening. Computational methods include comparative genomics, clustering of known or predicted TF-binding sites, and supervised machine-learning approaches trained on known CRMs. All of these methods have proven effective for CRM discovery, but each has its own considerations and limitations, and each is subject to a greater or lesser number of false-positive identifications. Experimental confirmation of predictions is essential, although shortcomings in current methods suggest that additional means of validation need to be developed.

Because coffee plantations have a lifespan of about thirty years, the likely effects of future climates are already a concern. Forward-looking research on adaptation is therefore in high demand across the entire supply chain. In this paper we seek to project current and future climate suitability for coffee production (Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora) on a global scale. We used machine learning algorithms to derive functions of climatic suitability from a database of geo-referenced production locations. Use of several parameter combinations enhances the robustness of our analysis. The resulting multi-model ensemble suggests that higher temperatures may reduce yields of C. arabica, while C. canephora could suffer from increasing variability of intra-seasonal temperatures. Climate change will reduce the global area suitable for coffee by about 50 % across emission scenarios. Impacts are highest at low latitudes and low altitudes. Impacts at higher altitudes and higher latitudes are still negative but less pronounced. The world's dominant production regions in Brazil and Vietnam may experience substantial reductions in area available for coffee. Some regions in East Africa and Asia may become more suitable, but these are partially in forested areas, which could pose a challenge to mitigation efforts.

Several automated or semi-automated detection technologies have been developed in the past among which infrasound-based detection is the most promising for regional-scale avalanche monitoring. However, due to significant ambient noise content in infrasonic signals, e.g. from atmospheric processes or airplanes, fully automated and reliable avalanche detection has been very challenging. Signal processing is highly critical and strongly affects detection accuracy. Here, a robust detection method by using supervised machine learning is introduced. Machine learning algorithms can take into account multiple signal features and statistically optimize the classification task. We analyzed infrasound data with concurrent visual avalanche observations from the test site Lavin (Eastern Swiss Alps) for the winter of 2011-2012. A support vector machine was trained by using training data from the first half of the winter season and the accuracy was tested on data from the second half of the season. A significant reduction of false detections, from 65% to 10%, was achieved compared to a threshold-based classifier provided by the sensor manufacturer. The proposed method enables reliable assessment of the avalanche activity in the surroundings of the system and paves the way towards robust and fully automated avalanche detection using infrasonic systems.

J	Li, YX; Zhao, YL; Liu, B; Ji, S				Li, Yu-xiang; Zhao, Yin-liang; Liu, Bin; Ji, Shuo			Optimization of thread partitioning parameters in speculative multithreading based on artificial immune algorithm	FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Speculative multithreading; Thread partitioning; Artificial immune algorithm	ARCHITECTURE	Thread partition plays an important role in speculative multithreading (SpMT) for automatic parallelization of irregular programs. Using unified values of partition parameters to partition different applications leads to the fact that every application cannot own its optimal partition scheme. In this paper, five parameters affecting thread partition are extracted from heuristic rules. They are the dependence threshold (DT), lower limit of thread size (TSL), upper limit of thread size (TSU), lower limit of spawning distance (SDL), and upper limit of spawning distance (SDU). Their ranges are determined in accordance with heuristic rules, and their step-sizes are set empirically. Under the condition of setting speedup as an objective function, all combinations of five threshold values form the solution space, and our aim is to search for the best combination to obtain the best thread granularity, thread dependence, and spawning distance, so that every application has its best partition scheme. The issue can be attributed to a single objective optimization problem. We use the artificial immune algorithm (AIA) to search for the optimal solution. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to implement the process. Experiments show that we can obtain the optimal parameter values for every benchmark, and Olden benchmarks partitioned with the optimized parameter values deliver a performance improvement of 3.00% on a 4-core platform compared with a machine learning based approach, and 8.92% compared with a heuristics-based approach.

Process type identification in torrential catchments in the eastern Alps	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Steep headwater catchments; Geomorphological disposition parameters; Torrential process type classification; Machine learning; Eastem Alps	DEBRIS-FLOW; ITALIAN ALPS; SEDIMENT; RECOGNITION; CONNECTIVITY; PREDICTION; MORPHOLOGY; MOBILITY; HAZARD; FANS	Torrential hazards are omnipresent in the alpine regions, as it frequently causes damage to infrastructures. In some cases, even people's lives are endangered. The classification of these processes takes place according to factors like sediment concentration and flow behaviour and ranges from fluvial process types, including water floods and fluvial sediment transport processes, to fluvial mass movements such as debris flows. Following the hypothesis of this study, a context exists between basic geomorphological disposition parameters and potential dominant flow process types in a steep headwater catchment. Thus, examined catchments were selected based on a historical event documentation of torrential events in the Austrian Alps. In total, 84 catchments could be analysed, and 11 different morphometric parameters were considered. To predict the dominant torrential process type within a catchment, a naive Bayes classifier, a decision tree model, and a multinomial regression model was trained against the compiled geomorphological disposition parameters. All models as well as their combination were compared. Based on bootstrapping and complexity, we present the classification model with the lowest prediction error for our data that might help to identify the most likely torrential process within a considered catchment.

Accept/decline decision module for the liver simulated allocation model	HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Organ transplantation; Classification; Machine learning; Simulation	TRANSPLANTATION; CHOICE	Simulated allocation models (SAMs) are used to evaluate organ allocation policies. An important component of SAMs is a module that decides whether each potential recipient will accept an offered organ. The objective of this study was to develop and test accept-or-decline classifiers based on several machine-learning methods in an effort to improve the SAM for liver allocation. Feature selection and imbalance correction methods were tested and best approaches identified for application to organ transplant data. Then, we used 2011 liver match-run data to compare classifiers based on logistic regression, support vector machines, boosting, classification and regression trees, and Random Forests. Finally, because the accept-or-decline module will be embedded in a simulation model, we also developed an evaluation tool for comparing performance of predictors, which we call sample-path accuracy. The Random Forest method resulted in the smallest overall error rate, and boosting techniques had greater accuracy when both sensitivity and specificity were simultaneously considered important. Our comparisons show that no method dominates all others on all performance measures of interest. A logistic regression-based classifier is easy to implement and allows for pinpointing the contribution of each feature toward the probability of acceptance. Other methods we tested did not have a similar interpretation. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients decided to use the logistic regression-based accept-decline decision module in the next generation of liver SAM.

The process of calculating the hospital's expected outcome rate given its patient mix and service is called risk adjustment (Iezzoni 1997). Risk adjustment is critical for accurately evaluating and comparing hospitals' performances since we would not want to unfairly penalize a hospital just because it treats sicker patients. The key to risk adjustment is accurately estimating the probability of an Outcome given patient characteristics. For cases with binary outcomes, the method that is commonly used in risk adjustment is logistic regression. In this paper, we consider ensemble of trees methods as alternatives for risk adjustment, including random forests and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). Both random forests and BART are modern machine learning methods that have been shown recently to have excellent performance for prediction of outcomes in many settings. We apply these methods to carry out risk adjustment for the performance of neonatal intensive care units (NICU). We show that these ensemble of trees methods outperform logistic regression in predicting mortality among babies treated in NICU, and provide a superior method of risk adjustment compared to logistic regression.

J	Giang, PH				Giang, Phan H.			A machine learning approach to create blocking criteria for record linkage	HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Record linkage; Machine learning; Blocking criteria; Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) learning		Record linkage, a part of data cleaning, is recognized as one of most expensive steps in data warehousing. Most record linkage (RL) systems employ a strategy of using blocking filters to reduce the number of pairs to be matched. A blocking filter consists of a number of blocking criteria. Until recently, blocking criteria are selected manually by domain experts. This paper proposes a new method to automatically learn efficient blocking criteria for record linkage. Our method addresses the lack of sufficient labeled data for training. Unlike previous works, we do not consider a blocking filter in isolation but in the context of an accompanying matcher which is employed after the blocking filter. We show that given such a matcher, the labels (assigned to record pairs) that are relevant for learning are the labels assigned by the matcher (link/nonlink), not the labels assigned objectively (match/unmatch). This conclusion allows us to generate an unlimited amount of labeled data for training. We formulate the problem of learning a blocking filter as a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) learning problem and use the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory to guide the development of algorithm to search for blocking filters. We test the algorithm on a real patient master file of 2.18 million records. The experimental results show that compared with filters obtained by educated guess, the optimal learned filters have comparable recall but reduce throughput (runtime) by an order-of-magnitude factor.

For tackling this problem, this paper starts from a novel structure modeling of crowd behavior. We first propose an informative structural context descriptor (SCD) for describing the crowd individual, which originally introduces the potential energy function of particle's interforce in solid-state physics to intuitively conduct vision contextual cueing. For computing the crowd SCD variation effectively, we then design a robust multi-object tracker to associate the targets in different frames, which employs the incremental analytical ability of the 3-D discrete cosine transform (DCT). By online spatial-temporal analyzing the SCD variation of the crowd, the abnormality is finally localized. Our contribution mainly lies on three aspects: 1) the new exploration of abnormal detection from structure modeling where the motion difference between individuals is computed by a novel selective histogram of optical flow that makes the proposed method can deal with more kinds of anomalies; 2) the SCD description that can effectively represent the relationship among the individuals; and 3) the 3-D DCT multi-object tracker that can robustly associate the limited number of (instead of all) targets which makes the tracking analysis in high density crowd situation feasible. Experimental results on several publicly available crowd video datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The problem of feature selection becomes even more difficult with imbalance data, which occurs in real-world domains when the classes representing the data set are not equally distributed. Using the traditional classifiers to seek an accurate performance over a full range of instances is not suitable to deal with imbalanced learning tasks, since they tend to classify all the data into one class. In this paper, the Mahalanobis genetic algorithm(MGA) classifier is proposed to address the problem of feature selection for imbalance welding data. The MGA classifier was benchmarked with the Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MTS) classifier, in terms of the following metrics: the total misclassification errors, the area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. A real-life data set from the spot welding process was used as a pilot study. The results in terms of the total misclassification error and the AUC metrics showed that the MGA had better classification performance than MTS. Very close results were obtained when the training data set was balanced by using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) which indicates the suitability of the MGA and MTS classifiers to be used for the imbalance data set without using any preprocessor approach. Regarding the S/N ratio, the results were inconsistent with the other classification metrics, which raises the question about its credibility.

J	Kim, IJ; Xie, XH				Kim, In-Jung; Xie, Xiaohui			Handwritten Hangul recognition using deep convolutional neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION			English	Article						Handwritten Hangul recognition; Character recognition; Deep convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Gradient-based learning	ALGORITHM	In spite of the advances in recognition technology, handwritten Hangul recognition (HHR) remains largely unsolved due to the presence of many confusing characters and excessive cursiveness in Hangul handwritings. Even the best existing recognizers do not lead to satisfactory performance for practical applications and have much lower performance than those developed for Chinese or alphanumeric characters. To improve the performance of HHR, here we developed a new type of recognizers based on deep neural networks (DNNs). DNN has recently shown excellent performance in many pattern recognition and machine learning problems, but have not been attempted for HHR. We built our Hangul recognizers based on deep convolutional neural networks and proposed several novel techniques to improve the performance and training speed of the networks. We systematically evaluated the performance of our recognizers on two public Hangul image databases, SERI95a and PE92. Using our framework, we achieved a recognition rate of 95.96 % on SERI95a and 92.92 % on PE92. Compared with the previous best records of 93.71 % on SERI95a and 87.70 % on PE92, our results yielded improvements of 2.25 and 5.22 %, respectively. These improvements lead to error reduction rates of 35.71 % on SERI95a and 42.44 % on PE92, relative to the previous lowest error rates. Such improvement fills a significant portion of the large gap between practical requirement and the actual performance of Hangul recognizers.

We have observed that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) produce distinctive TEG tracings. We hypothesized that rigorously definable TEG patterns could discriminate between healthy controls and patients with ESRD and TIC. Methods: TEG was performed on blood from ESRD patients (n = 54) and blood from trauma patients requiring amassive blood transfusion (n = 16). Plots of independent TEG parameters were analyzed for patterns coupled to disease state, compared with controls. Decision trees for taxonomic classification were then built using the "R-Project" statistical software. Results: Minimally overlapping clusters of TEG results were observed for the three patient groups when coordinate pairs of maximum amplitude (MA) and TEG-activated clotting time (ACT) were plotted on orthogonal axes. Based on these groupings, a taxonomical classification tree was constructed using MA and TEG ACT. Branch points were set at an ACT of 103 s, and these branches subdivided for MA at 60.8 mm for the high ACT branch and 72.6 mm for the low ACT branch, providing a correct classification rate of 93.4%. Conclusions: ESRD and TIC demonstrate distinct TEG patterns. The coagulopathy of ESRD is typified by a prolonged enzymatic phase of clot formation, with normal-to-elevated final clot strength. Conversely, TIC is typified by prolonged clot formation and weakened clot strength. Our taxonomic categorization constitutes a rigorous system for the algorithmic interpretation of TEG based on cluster analysis. This will form the basis for clinical decision support software for viscoelastic hemostatic assays. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on a collection of ISI- and non-ISI-indexed articles in the areas of business and computer science, three classification models are trained. A sensitivity analysis is applied to demonstrate the impact of words in different syntactical forms on the classification decision. The results demonstrate that the lexical domains of ISI and non-ISI articles are distinguishable by machine learning techniques.

J	Carbajal, JP; Dambre, J; Hermans, M; Schrauwen, B				Carbajal, Juan Pablo; Dambre, Joni; Hermans, Michiel; Schrauwen, Benjamin			Memristor Models for Machine Learning	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	In the quest for alternatives to traditional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, it is being suggested that digital computing efficiency and power can be improved by matching the precision to the application. Many applications do not need the high precision that is being used today. In particular, large gains in area and power efficiency could be achieved by dedicated analog realizations of approximate computing engines. In this work we explore the use of memristor networks for analog approximate computation, based on a machine learning framework called reservoir computing. Most experimental investigations on the dynamics of memristors focus on their nonvolatile behavior. Hence, the volatility that is present in the developed technologies is usually unwanted and is not included in simulation models. In contrast, in reservoir computing, volatility is not only desirable but necessary. Therefore, in this work, we propose two different ways to incorporate it into memristor simulation models. The first is an extension of Strukov's model, and the second is an equivalent Wiener model approximation. We analyze and compare the dynamical properties of these models and discuss their implications for the memory and the nonlinear processing capacity of memristor networks. Our results indicate that device variability, increasingly causing problems in traditional computer design, is an asset in the context of reservoir computing. We conclude that although both models could lead to useful memristor-based reservoir computing systems, their computational performance will differ. Therefore, experimental modeling research is required for the development of accurate volatile memristor models.

It offers an intuitive extension to the application of machine-learning methods to structure activity data where focus is on predictions with pre-defined confidence levels. A conformal predictor will make correct predictions on new compounds corresponding to a user defined confidence level. The confidence level can be altered depending on the situation the predictor is being used in, which allows for flexibility and adaption to risks that the user is willing to take. We demonstrate the usefulness of conformal prediction by applying it to 2 publicly available CAESAR binary classification datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identification of Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy in Patients with Cirrhosis Based on White Matter Imaging and Bayesian Data Mining	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							APPARENT DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT; INHIBITORY CONTROL TEST; CEREBRAL EDEMA; LIVER-DISEASE; WATER-CONTENT; ABNORMALITIES; BRAIN; DIAGNOSIS; QUANTIFICATION; HYPONATREMIA	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter abnormalities have been demonstrated to play an important role in minimal hepatic encephalopathy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether WM diffusion tensor imaging can be used to identify minimal hepatic encephalopathy among patients with cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 65 patients with cirrhosis with covert hepatic encephalopathy (29 with minimal hepatic encephalopathy and 36 without hepatic encephalopathy). Participants underwent DTI, from which we generated mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy maps. We used a Bayesian machine-learning technique, called Graphical-Model-based Multivariate Analysis, to determine WM regions that characterize group differences. To further test the clinical significance of these potential biomarkers, we performed Cox regression analysis to assess the potential of these WM regions in predicting survival. RESULTS: In mean diffusivity or fractional anisotropy maps, 2 spatially distributed WM regions (predominantly located in the bilateral frontal lobes, corpus callosum, and parietal lobes) were consistently identified as differentiating minimal hepatic encephalopathy from no hepatic encephalopathy and yielded 75.4%-81.5% and 83.1%-92.3% classification accuracy, respectively. We were able to follow 55 of 65 patients (median = 18 months), and 15 of these patients eventually died of liver-related causes. Survival analysis indicated that mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy values in WM regions were predictive of survival, in addition to the Child-Pugh score. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that WM DTI can provide useful biomarkers differentiating minimal hepatic encephalopathy from no hepatic encephalopathy, which would be helpful for minimal hepatic encephalopathy detection and subsequent treatment.

However, brain degeneration in MCI evolves with time and differs from patient to patient, making early diagnosis a very challenging task. Despite these difficulties, many machine learning techniques have already been used for the diagnosis of MCI and for predicting MCI to AD conversion, but the MCI group used in previous works is usually very heterogeneous containing subjects at different stages. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the disease stage impacts on the ability of machine learning methodologies to predict conversion. After identifying the converters and estimating the time of conversion (TC) (using neuropsychological test scores), we devised 5 subgroups of MCI converters (MCI-C) based on their temporal distance to the conversion instant (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months before conversion). Next, we used the FDG-PET images of these subgroups and trained classifiers to distinguish between the MCI-C at different stages and stable non-converters (MCI-NC). Our results show that MCI to AD conversion can be predicted as early as 24 months prior to conversion and that the discriminative power of the machine learning methods decreases with the increasing temporal distance to the TC, as expected. These findings were consistent for all the tested classifiers. Our results also show that this decrease arises from a reduction in the information contained in the regions used for classification and by a decrease in the stability of the automatic selection procedure.

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) transcripts omit the diacritics, which are essential for many machine learning tasks like Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems. In this work Arabic diacritics restoration is tackled under a deep learning framework that includes the Confused Sub-set Resolution (CSR) method to improve the classification accuracy, in addition to an Arabic Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging framework using deep neural nets. Special focus is given to syntactic diacritization, which still suffers low accuracy as indicated in prior works. Evaluation is done versus state-of-the-art systems reported in literature, with quite challenging datasets collected from different domains. Standard datasets like the LDC Arabic Tree Bank are used in addition to custom ones we have made available online to allow other researchers to replicate these results. Results show significant improvement of the proposed techniques over other approaches, reducing the syntactic classification error to 9.9% and morphological classification error to 3% compared to 12.7% and 3.8% of the best reported results in literature, improving the error by 22% over the best reported systems.

Recent advances in machine learning, as well as in computational models of the human auditory system, have contributed to advances in this increasingly popular research field. Robust sound event classification, the ability to recognise sounds under real-world noisy conditions, is an especially challenging task. Classification methods translated from the speech recognition domain, using features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, have been shown to perform reasonably well for the sound event classification task, although spectrogram-based or auditory image analysis techniques reportedly achieve superior performance in noise. This paper outlines a sound event classification framework that compares auditory image front end features with spectrogram image-based front end features, using support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers. Performance is evaluated on a standard robust classification task in different levels of corrupting noise, and with several system enhancements, and shown to compare very well with current state-of-the-art classification techniques.

Despite their usefulness, traces from the field can be quite over-whelming, especially for software systems with a vast client base. In the execution of realistic applications, many of them being millions of lines of code, there are just too many traces that are generated. In addition, traces are known to be extraordinarily large, which further complicates matters. Fortunately, not all field failures are caused by new faults. In fact, previous studies showed that 50% to 90% of field failures are due to previously known faults. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach that automatically detects recurring faulty functions in the traces of new field failures. We achieve our goal by training decision trees on earlier resolved traces of system failures from the current and prior releases of the system. When applied to a large industrial system with 20 million lines of code and 200,000 functions, our approach was able to detect recurring faulty functions in the traces of field failures with an accuracy of 90%, to even 97% in some cases.

RV has primarily been applied to bacterial pathogens to identify proteins that can be formulated into subunit vaccines, which consist of one or more protein antigens. An RV approach based on a filtering method has already been used to construct a subunit vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B that is now registered in several countries (Bexsero). Recently, machine learning methods have been used to improve the ability of RV approaches to identify vaccine candidates. Further improvements related to the incorporation of epitope-binding annotation and gene expression data are discussed. In the future, it is envisaged that RV approaches will facilitate rapid vaccine design with less reliance on conventional animal testing and clinical trials in order to curb the threat of antibiotic resistance or newly emerged outbreaks of bacterial origin.

A fully atomistic description of the protein and the surrounding solvent molecules is used, and this complex energy landscape is sampled by means of parallel tempering metadynamics simulations. The ensemble of configurations explored is analyzed using the recently proposed sketch-map algorithm. Further simulations allow us to probe how mutations affect the structures adopted by this protein. We find that many of the configurations adopted by a mutant are the same as those adopted by the wild-type protein. Furthermore, certain mutations destabilize secondary-structure-containing configurations by preventing the formation of hydrogen bonds or by promoting the formation of new intramolecular contacts. Our analysis demonstrates that machine-learning techniques can be used to study the energy landscapes of complex molecules and that the visualizations that are generated in this way provide a natural basis for examining how the stabilities of particular configurations of the molecule are affected by factors such as temperature or structural mutations.

J	Mahmood, A; Li, TR; Yang, Y; Wang, HJ; Afzal, M				Mahmood, Amjad; Li, Tianrui; Yang, Yan; Wang, Hongjun; Afzal, Mehtab			Semi-supervised evolutionary ensembles for Web video categorization	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Genetic algorithm; Semantic similarity; Clustering ensemble; Social media mining; Video categorization	GENETIC ALGORITHM; SIMILARITY; KNOWLEDGE	Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have been developing rapidly as a powerful and general learning approach which has been used successfully to find a reasonable solution for data mining and knowledge discovery. Genetic algorithm (GA) is a kind of mainstream EA paradigm with a purpose of developing solutions for optimization problems. Clustering ensembles have emerged as an outstanding algorithm in machine learning to leverage the consensus across multiple clustering solutions and combines their predictions into a single solution with improved robustness, stability and accuracy. Multimedia advancement and popularity of the social Web has collectively provided an easy way to generate bulk of videos. Categorization of such Web videos has become a hot research challenge. In this paper, we propose a Semi-supervised Evolutionary Ensemble (SS-EE) framework for social media mining, e.g., Web Video Categorization (WVC), using their low cost textual features, intrinsic relations and extrinsic Web support. The contributions of this research work are as follows. First, we extend the traditional Vector Space Model (VSM) to Semantic VSM (S-VSM) by considering the semantic similarity between the feature terms using Normalized Google Distance (NGD) approach. Second, we define a new distance measure, Triangular Similarity (TrS) between two Textual Feature Vectors (TFV) based on the frequencies of most relevant terms in each category. Third, we iterate the clustering ensemble process with the help of GA guided by a new measure, Pre-Paired Percentage (PPP), to be used as the fitness function during the genetic cycle. Fourth, in the key steps of the GA, crossover and mutation genetic operators, we define them by an intelligent mechanism of clustering ensemble. Fifth, in order to terminate the genetic cycle, we define another new measure, Clustering Quality (Cq), based on similarity matrix and clustering labels. Experiments on real world social-Web data (YouTube) have been performed to validate the SS-EE framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to its high impact in various applications involving reasoning tasks, machine learning researchers have proposed a number of techniques to learn Causal Bayesian Networks. Within the existing works in this direction, few studies have explicitly considered the role that decisional guidance might play to alternate between observational and experimental data processing. In this paper, we go further by introducing a serendipitous strategy to elucidate semantic background knowledge provided by the domain ontology to learn the causal structure of Bayesian Networks. We also complement our contribution with an enrichment process by which it will be possible to reuse these causal discoveries, support the evolving character of the semantic background and make an ontology evolution. Finally, the proposed method will be validated through simulations and real data analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, inherent complexities like uncertainty, vagueness and overlapping among clusters make the analysis of real life categorical data set more difficult. Recent literature review shows that the well-known categorical data clustering techniques are using different similarity/dissimilarity measures to tackle the inherent complexities of the categorical attribute values. Generally, it is hard to find single method and cluster validity measure that can be used as perfect or standard for all kinds of categorical data sets. Hence, in this paper first, a clustering method for categorical data is proposed by fusing rough set and fuzzy set theories. Subsequently, an ensemble based framework is designed with the recently proposed similarity/dissimilarity measures in order to have better clustering results for different types of categorical data sets. For this purpose, the proposed rough fuzzy clustering method is used sequentially with the integration of different measures to evolve the clustering solutions. Using consensus of these solutions, pure classified, semi rough and pure rough points are identified. Thereafter, machine learning method, called Random Forest, is used in incremental way to classify the semi and pure rough points using pure classified points to yield better clustering results. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated in comparison with several other recently developed clustering methods. Additionally, the selection of Random Forest in the proposed framework is justified by comparing its performance with other well-known machine learning methods like K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine. Ten categorical data sets are used for the experimental purpose. Finally, statistical significance test has been conducted to judge the superiority of the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Simultaneously, any known or postulated information concerning genes and proteins is part of the ever-growing published scientific literature, which is expanding at a rate of over a million new publications per year. Computational tools that attempt to automatically predict and annotate protein characteristics, such as function and localization patterns, are being developed along with systems that aim to support the process via text mining. Most work on protein characterization focuses on features derived directly from protein sequence data. Protein-related work that does aim to utilize the literature typically concentrates on extracting specific facts (e.g., protein interactions) from text. In the past few years we have taken a different route, treating the literature as a source of text-based features, which can be employed just as sequence-based protein-features were used in earlier work, for predicting protein subcellular location and possibly also function. We discuss here in detail the overall approach, along with results from work we have done in this area demonstrating the value of this method and its potential use. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Aggregator: A machine learning approach to identifying MEDLINE articles that derive from the same underlying clinical trial	METHODS			English	Article						Evidence-based medicine; Clinical trials; Systematic reviews; Bias; Information retrieval; Informatics	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; DUPLICATE PUBLICATION; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV; METAANALYSIS; SIMILARITY; MODEL	Objective: It is important to identify separate publications that report outcomes from the same underlying clinical trial, in order to avoid over-counting these as independent pieces of evidence. Methods: We created positive and negative training sets (comprised of pairs of articles reporting on the same condition and intervention) that were, or were not, linked to the same clinicaltrials.gov trial registry number. Features were extracted from MEDLINE and PubMed metadata; pairwise similarity scores were modeled using logistic regression. Results: Article pairs from the same trial were identified with high accuracy (F1 score = 0.843). We also created a clustering tool, Aggregator, that takes as input a PubMed user query for RCTs on a given topic, and returns article clusters predicted to arise from the same clinical trial. Discussion: Although painstaking examination of full-text may be needed to be conclusive, metadata are surprisingly accurate in predicting when two articles derive from the same underlying clinical trial.

It remains unclear if MRI biomarkers generalize across different centers and MR scanners and represent accurate surrogates of the risk for developing this devastating illness. Therefore, we assessed whether a MRI-based prediction system identified patients with a later disease transition among 73 clinically defined high-risk persons recruited at two different early recognition centers. Prognostic performance was measured using cross-validation, independent test validation, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Transition outcomes were correctly predicted in 80% of test cases (sensitivity: 76%, specificity: 85%, positive likelihood ratio: 5.1). Thus, given a 54-month transition risk of 45% across both centers, MRI-based predictors provided a 36%-increase of prognostic certainty. After stratifying individuals into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups using the predictor's decision score, the high- vs low-risk groups had median psychosis-free survival times of 5 vs 51 months and transition rates of 88% vs 8%. The predictor's decision function involved gray matter volume alterations in prefrontal, perisylvian, and subcortical structures. Our results support the existence of a cross-center neuroanatomical signature of emerging psychosis enabling individualized risk staging across different high-risk populations. Supplementary results revealed that (1) potentially confounding between-site differences were effectively mitigated using statistical correction methods, and (2) the detection of the prodromal signature considerably depended on the available sample sizes. These observations pave the way for future multicenter studies, which may ultimately facilitate the neurobiological refinement of risk criteria and personalized preventive therapies based on individualized risk profiling tools.

Humans have idiosyncratic and task-specific scanpaths for judging faces	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Eye movements; Machine learning; Scanpath routines; Face perception	SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; PSYCHOPHYSICS TOOLBOX; RECOGNITION TASKS; OBSERVERS TASK; INFORMATION; PATTERNS; YARBUS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; VALIDATION	Since Yarbus's seminal work, vision scientists have argued that our eye movement patterns differ depending upon our task. This has recently motivated the creation of multi-fixation pattern analysis algorithms that try to infer a person's task (or mental state) from their eye movements alone. Here, we introduce new algorithms for multi-fixation pattern analysis, and we use them to argue that people have scanpath routines for judging faces. We tested our methods on the eye movements of subjects as they made six distinct judgments about faces. We found that our algorithms could detect whether a participant is trying to distinguish angriness, happiness, trustworthiness, tiredness, attractiveness, or age. However, our algorithms were more accurate at inferring a subject's task when only trained on data from that subject than when trained on data gathered from other subjects, and we were able to infer the identity of our subjects using the same algorithms. These results suggest that (1) individuals have scanpath routines for judging faces, and that (2) these are diagnostic of that subject, but that (3) at least for the tasks we used, subjects do not converge on the same "ideal" scanpath pattern. Whether universal scanpath patterns exist for a task, we suggest, depends on the task's constraints and the level of expertise of the subject. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Conducting ODC classification on existing organizational defect reports is human-intensive and requires experts' knowledge of both ODC and system domains. This paper presents AutoODC, an approach for automating ODC classification by casting it as a supervised text classification problem. Rather than merely applying the standard machine learning framework to this task, we seek to acquire a better ODC classification system by integrating experts' ODC experience and domain knowledge into the learning process via proposing a novel relevance annotation framework. We have trained AutoODC using two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for text classification, Naive Bayes (NB) and support vectormachine (SVM), and evaluated it on both an industrial defect report from the social network domain and a larger defect list extracted from a publicly accessible defect tracker of the open source system FileZilla. AutoODC is a promising approach: not only does it leverage minimal human effort beyond the human annotations typically required by standard machine learning approaches, but it achieves overall accuracies of 82.9 % (NB) and 80.7 % (SVM) on the industrial defect report, and accuracies of 77.5 % (NB) and 75.2 % (SVM) on the larger, more diversified open source defect list.

This paper presents SMPLearner, an automated learning-based approach to train maintainability predictors by harvesting the actual average maintenance effort computed from the code change history as well as employing a much richer set of 44 four-level hierarchical code metrics collected by static code analysis tools. We systematically evaluated SMPLearner on 150 observations partitioned from releases of eight large scale open source software systems. Our evaluation showed that SMPLearner not only outperformed the traditional 4-metric MI model but also the recent learning-based maintainability predictors constructed based on single Class-level metrics, demonstrating that single Class-level metrics were not sufficient for maintainability prediction.

Washing machines were developed that use lower washing temperatures, smaller amounts of water and biodegradable detergents. These conditions may favour the enrichment of opportunistic human pathogenic fungi. We focused on the isolation of fungi from two user-accessible parts of washing machines that often contain microbial biofilms: drawers for detergents and rubber door seals. Out of 70 residential washing machines sampled in Slovenia, 79% were positive for fungi. In total, 72 strains belonging to 12 genera and 26 species were isolated. Among these, members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani species complexes, Candida parapsilosis and Exophiala phaeomuriforrnis represented 44% of fungi detected. These species are known as opportunistic human pathogens and can cause skin, nail or eye infections also in healthy humans. A machine learning analysis revealed that presence of detergents and softeners followed by washing temperature, represent most critical factors for fungal colonization. Three washing machines with persisting malodour that resulted in bad smelling laundry were analysed for the presence of fungi and bacteria. In these cases, fungi were isolated in low numbers (7.5 %), while bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Sphingornonas species prevailed. (C) 2014 The British Mycological Society.

While some substantial progress has been made in this area, there are still several challenges ranging from content evaluation to personalized content generation. In this paper, we present a novel PCG framework based on machine learning, named learning-based procedure content generation (LBPCG), to tackle a number of challenging problems. By exploring and exploiting information gained in game development and public player test, our framework can generate robust content adaptable to end-user or target players on-line with minimal interruption to their gameplay experience. As the data-driven methodology is emphasized in our framework, we develop learning-based enabling techniques to implement the various models required in our framework. For a proof of concept, we have developed a prototype based on the classic open source first-person shooter game, Quake. Simulation results suggest that our framework is promising in generating quality content.

High-dimensional gait datasets are difficult to interpret; machine learning can provide guidance regarding the most relevant gait phases and joint angles for visual analysis and quantify the difference between healthy and pathological gait. We propose an explicit state duration hidden Markov model (HMM) modeling the timeseries data of a subject or a group and the use of a reference-based measure that compares the most likely observations in each state. Based on this stochastic framework, the similarity between healthy and pathological gait can be quantified for each state, each joint angle, and each subject. This concept also includes an overall gait index useful for group comparison or the assessment of an individual's gait. For visualization, joint angle timeseries can be generated from the explicit state duration HMM. The accuracy of the explicit state duration HMM and the performance of the reference-based measures are evaluated on a dataset including strides of healthy subjects and patients suffering from arthritis.

Characterizing stand-level forest canopy cover and height using Landsat time series, samples of airborne LiDAR, and the Random Forest algorithm	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Landsat time series; LiDAR; Forest disturbance; Canopy cover; Canopy height; Random forest	RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY; VEGETATION INDEXES; OREGON FORESTS; WESTERN OREGON; ETM PLUS; DISTURBANCE; INVENTORY; NORTHWEST; BIOMASS; TM	Many forest management activities, including the development of forest inventories, require spatially detailed forest canopy cover and height data. Among the various remote sensing technologies, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) offers the most accurate and consistent means for obtaining reliable canopy structure measurements. A potential solution to reduce the cost of LiDAR data, is to integrate transects (samples) of LiDAR data with frequently acquired and spatially comprehensive optical remotely sensed data. Although multiple regression is commonly used for such modeling, often it does not fully capture the complex relationships between forest structure variables. This study investigates the potential of Random Forest (RF), a machine learning technique, to estimate LiDAR measured canopy structure using a time series of Landsat imagery. The study is implemented over a 2600 ha area of industrially managed coastal temperate forests on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We implemented a trajectory-based approach to time series analysis that generates time since disturbance (TSD) and disturbance intensity information for each pixel and we used this information to stratify the forest land base into two strata: mature forests and young forests. Canopy cover and height for three forest classes (i.e. mature, young and mature and young (combined)) were modeled separately using multiple regression and Random Forest (RF) techniques. For all forest classes, the RF models provided improved estimates relative to the multiple regression models. The lowest validation error was obtained for the mature forest strata in a RF model (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 2.39 m and bias = -0.16 for canopy height; R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.068% and bias = -0.0049 for canopy cover). This study demonstrates the value of using disturbance and successional history to inform estimates of canopy structure and obtain improved estimates of forest canopy cover and height using the RF algorithm.

A novel method is proposed for low-rank matrix recovery, targeting at higher recovery accuracy and stronger theoretical guarantee. Specifically, the proposed method is based on a nonconvex optimization model, by solving the low-rank matrix which can be recovered from the noisy observation. To solve the model, an effective algorithm is derived by minimizing over the variables alternately. It is proved theoretically that this algorithm has stronger theoretical guarantee than the existing work. In natural image denoising experiments, the proposed method achieves lower recovery error than the two compared methods. The proposed low-rank matrix recovery method is also applied to solve two real-world problems, i.e., removing noise from verification code and removing watermark from images, in which the images recovered by the proposed method are less noisy than those of the two compared methods.

J	Cui, Q; Bai, FS; Gao, B; Liu, TY				Cui, Qing; Bai, Feng-Shan; Gao, Bin; Liu, Tie-Yan			Global Optimization for Advertisement Selection in Sponsored Search	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						advertisement selection; sponsored search; probability model	AUCTIONS	Advertisement (ad) selection plays an important role in sponsored search, since it is an upstream component and will heavily influence the effectiveness of the subsequent auction mechanism. However, most existing ad selection methods regard ad selection as a relatively independent module, and only consider the literal or semantic matching between queries and keywords during the ad selection process. In this paper, we argue that this approach is not globally optimal. Our proposal is to formulate ad selection as such an optimization problem that the selected ads can work together with downstream components (e.g., the auction mechanism) to achieve the maximization of user clicks, advertiser social welfare, and search engine revenue (we call the combination of these objective functions as the marketplace objective for ease of reference). To this end, we 1) extract a bunch of features to represent each pair of query and keyword, and 2) train a machine learning model that maps the features to a binary variable indicating whether the keyword is selected or not, by maximizing the aforementioned marketplace objective. This formalization seems quite natural; however, it is technically difficult because the marketplace objective is non-convex, discontinuous, and indifferentiable regarding the model parameter due to the ranking and second-price rules in the auction mechanism. To tackle the challenge, we propose a probabilistic approximation of the marketplace objective, which is smooth and can be effectively optimized by conventional optimization techniques. We test the ad selection model learned with our proposed method using the sponsored search log from a commercial search engine. The experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform several ad selection algorithms on all the metrics under investigation.

It can be either in an organized form, e.g., speech or music, or in a non organized form, i.e., Sound Events (SEs). There are many studies focusing on emotion recognition from music content, but the research on emotion recognition from SEs is a rather new field. This works falls within this field and concludes that the rhythmic characteristics of an SE have a major impact on the listener's arousal. This result verifies the empirical knowledge that the rhythm of sound affects the listener's activation state. Moreover, we also investigate whether the above characteristics also affect the pleasure of the listener Toward this aim, we have utilized a well known data set of emotionally annotated SEs, extracted various rhythm-related technical cues, and conducted a series of machine learning experiments. The overall results indicate a relation of the rhythm and listener's valence with accuracy results reaching up to 63%.

Four groups of features are defined, which are related to head movement and direction, and may help gaining insight on the expressivity and cohesion of the performance, discriminating between different performance conditions. Then, the features are evaluated both at a global scale and at a local scale. The findings obtained from the analysis of a string quartet recorded in an ecological setting show that using these features alone or in their combination may help in distinguishing between two types of performance: (a) a concert-like condition, where all musicians aim at performing at best, (b) a perturbed one, where the 1 violinist devises alternative interpretations of the music score without discussing them with the other musicians. In the global data analysis, the discriminative power of the features is investigated through statistical tests. Then, in the local data analysis, a larger amount of data is used to exploit more sophisticated machine learning techniques to select suitable subsets of the features, which are then used to train an SVM classifier to perform binary classification. Interestingly, the features whose discriminative power is evaluated as large (respectively, small) in the global analysis are also evaluated in a similar way in the local analysis. When used together, the 22 features that have been defined in the paper demonstrate to be efficient for classification, leading to a percentage of about 90 % successfully classified examples among the ones not used in the training phase. Similar results are obtained considering only a subset of 15 features.

This is why advertisement purchasers believe that the number of passing viewers provides crucial information for their marketing strategies. In this paper, a real-time person counting/memorizing system is designed capable of distinguishing the gender of potential customers. An adaptive boosting (Adaboost) machine learning algorithm is used to detect human faces and utilize specific filtering criteria to eliminate useless data. For each detected person, face and torso information are recorded in a database for identification. The least recently used identification record will be deleted if the database is full. Gender classification is performed by support vector machine using hair ratios extracted from gender characterizing regions. Based on a variety of experiments, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than 90 % for person-counting and higher than 94 % for gender classification. Moreover, the execution speed on personal computers may reach 15-20 fps.

A multiplex network is a graph defined over a set of nodes linked by different types of relations. For instance, the multiplex network we are studying here is defined as follows : nodes represent authors and links can be one of the following types: co-authorship links, co-venue attending links and co-citing links. A supervised-machine learning based link prediction approach is applied. A link formation model is learned based on a set of topological attributes describing both positive and negative examples. While such an approach has been successfully applied in the context on simple networks, different options can be applied to extend it to multiplex networks. One option is to compute topological attributes in each layer of the multiplex. Another one is to compute directly new multiplex-based attributes quantifying the multiplex nature of dyads (potential links). These different approaches are studied and compared through experiments on real datasets extracted from the bibliographical database DBLP.

Although there exist several clustering algorithms for numeric data, more sophisticated clustering algorithms to address mixed data (numeric and categorical data) more efficiently are still required. Other important issues to be considered in clustering are incremental learning and generating a sufficient number of clusters without specifying the number of clusters a priori. In this paper, we introduce a mixed data clustering method which is incremental and generates a sufficient number of clusters automatically. The proposed method is based on the Adjusted Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network (ASOINN) algorithm exploiting a new distance measure and new update rules for handling mixed data. The proposed clustering method is compared with the ASOINN and three other clustering algorithms comprehensively. The results of comparative experiments on various data sets using several clustering evaluation measures show the effectiveness of the proposed mixed data clustering method.

J	Crown, WH				Crown, William H.			Potential Application of Machine Learning in Health Outcomes Research and Some Statistical Cautions	VALUE IN HEALTH			English	Editorial Material						machine learning; outcomes research; treatment effects		Traditional analytic methods are often ill-suited to the evolving world of health care big data characterized by massive volume, complexity, and velocity. In particular, methods are needed that can estimate models efficiently using very large datasets containing healthcare utilization data, clinical data, data from personal devices, and many other sources. Although very large, such datasets can also be quite sparse (ag., device data may only be available for a small subset of individuals), which creates problems for traditional regression models. Many machine learning methods address such limitations effectively but are still subject to the usual sources of bias that commonly arise in observational studies. Researchers using machine learning methods such as lasso or ridge regression should assess these models using conventional specification tests.

Emerging Good Practices Task Force	Selecting a Dynamic Simulation Modeling Method for Health Care Delivery Research Part 2: Report of the ISPOR Dynamic Simulation Modeling Emerging Good Practices Task Force	VALUE IN HEALTH			English	Article						decision making; dynamic simulation modeling; health care delivery; methods	DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION; AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; SYSTEM DYNAMICS; ODD PROTOCOL; TRANSMISSION; VALIDATION; GUIDELINES; DECISIONS	In a previous report, the ISPOR Task Force on Dynamic Simulation Modeling Applications in Health Care Delivery Research Emerging Good Practices introduced the fundamentals of dynamic simulation modeling and identified the types of health care delivery problems for which dynamic simulation modeling can be used more effectively than other modeling methods. The hierarchical relationship between the health care delivery system, providers, patients, and other stakeholders exhibits a level of complexity that ought to be captured using dynamic simulation modeling methods. As a tool to help researchers decide whether dynamic simulation modeling is an appropriate method for modeling the effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops, Agents, Time, Emergence (SIMULATE) checklist consisting of eight elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation modeling methods system dynamics, discreteevent simulation, and agent based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most suitable method depending on 1) the purpose type of problem and research questions being investigated, 2) the object scope of the model, and 3) the method to model the object to achieve the purpose. Finally, we provide guidance for emerging good practices for dynamic simulation modeling in the health sector, covering all aspects, from the engagement of decision makers in the model design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by providing some recommendations about the application of these methods to add value to informed decision making, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement, starting with the problem definition. Finally, we identify areas in which further methodological development will likely occur given the growing "volume, velocity and variety' and availability of "big data" to provide empirical evidence and techniques such as machine learning for parameter estimation in dynamic simulation models. Upon reviewing this report in addition to using the SIMULATE checklist, the readers should be able to identify whether dynamic simulation modeling methods are appropriate to address the problem at hand and to recognize the differences of these methods from those of other, more traditional modeling approaches such as Markov models and decision trees. This report provides an overview of these modeling methods and examples of health care system problems in which such methods have been useful. The primary aim of the report was to aid decisions as to whether these simulation methods are appropriate to address specific health systems problems. The report directs readers to other resources for further education on these individual modeling methods for system interventions in the emerging field of health care delivery science and implementation.

Complex nature of this property has restricted most of the previous theoretical studies on thermophysical properties to bulk properties measured far from the interface. Considering the drawbacks and deficiencies of preexisting models, there is yet a huge interest in accurate determination of this property using a rather simple and more comprehensive modeling approach. In recent years, inductive machine learning algorithms have widely been applied in solving a variety of engineering problems. This study introduces least-square support vector machines (LS-SVM) approach as a viable and powerful tool for predicting the interfacial tension between pure hydrocarbon and water. Comparing the model to experimental data, an excellent agreement was observed yielding the overall squared correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.993. Proposed model was also found to outperform when compared to some previously presented multiple regression models. An outlier detection method was also introduced to determine the model applicability domain and diagnose the outliers in the gathered dataset. Results of this study indicate that the model can be applied in systems over temperature ranges of 454.40-890 degrees R and pressure ranges of 0.1-300 MPa.

An integrated breast cancer risk assessment and management model based on fuzzy cognitive maps	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Breast cancer; Risk assessment; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Hebbian learning; Mammogram screening; Medical decision support systems	HEBBIAN LEARNING ALGORITHM; DECISION-MAKING; WOMEN; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; HISTORY	Background: There is a growing demand for women to be classified into different risk groups of developing breast cancer (BC). The focus of the reported work is on the development of an integrated risk prediction model using a two-level fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) model. The proposed model combines the results of the initial screening mammogram of the given woman with her demographic risk factors to predict the post-screening risk of developing BC. Methods: The level-1 FCM models the demographic risk profile. A nonlinear Hebbian learning algorithm is used to train this model and thus to help on predicting the BC risk grade based on demographic risk factors identified by domain experts. The risk grades estimated by the proposed model are validated using two standard BC risk assessment models viz. Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick. The level-2 FCM models the features of the screening mammogram concerning normal, benign and malignant cases. The data driven Hebbian learning algorithm (DDNHL) is used to train this model in order to predict the BC risk grade based on these mammographic image features. An overall risk grade is calculated by combining the outcomes of these two FCMs. Results: The main limitation of the Gail model of underestimating the risk level of women with strong family history is overcome by the proposed model. IBIS is a hard computing tool based on the Tyrer-Cuzick model that is comprehensive enough in covering a wide range of demographic risk factors including family history, but it generates results in terms of numeric risk score based on predefined formulae. Thus the outcome is difficult to interpret by naive users. Besides these models are based only on the demographic details and do not take into account the findings of the screening mammogram. The proposed integrated model overcomes the above described limitations of the existing models and predicts the risk level in terms of qualitative grades. The predictions of the proposed NHL-FCM model comply with the Tyrer-Cuzick model for 36 out of 40 patient cases. With respect to tumor grading, the overall classification accuracy of DDNHL-FCM using 70 real mammogram screening images is 94.3%. The testing accuracy of the proposed model using 10-fold cross validation technique outperforms other standard machine learning based inference engines. Conclusion: In the perspective of clinical oncologists, this is a comprehensive front-end medical decision support system that assists them in efficiently assessing the expected post-screening BC risk level of the given individual and hence prescribing individualized preventive interventions and more intensive surveillance for high risk women.

We have developed new automated learning-based process-execution time-prediction and process status-prediction methods that can be embedded into an EIS. Process-execution time prediction is a regression problem and state-of-the-art (baseline) time-prediction methods use a machine-learning regression model. Process status prediction is a binary classification problem in which a class labeled "completed" or "in-progress" is assigned to a process with respect to an arbitrary predictive horizon (i.e., the future time given by the method user). The methods proposed in this paper integrate statistical methods with support-vector regression. Comparison results obtained from the real data of a digital-print enterprise show that the proposed time-prediction method reduces both the relative mean error and the root-mean-squared error of the regression model. Furthermore, the proposed status-prediction method not only achieves higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, it also estimates the probability of the predicted status. In addition, algorithm development and training phases of the proposed methods do not rely on any arbitrary predictive horizon. Therefore, a single time-prediction model as proposed is sufficient for status prediction as opposed to a baseline status-prediction method that requires classification models for all potential predictive horizons.

Unlike current state-of-the-art works, which unite pattern matching and machine-learning engines, we fully exploit the strengths of machine learning using novel techniques. By combing topological classification and critical feature extraction, our hotspot detection framework achieves very high accuracy. Furthermore, to speed-up the evaluation, we verify only possible layout clips instead of full-layout scanning. We utilize feedback learning and present redundant clip removal to reduce the false alarm. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is very accurate and demonstrates a rapid training convergence. Moreover, our framework outperforms the 2012 CAD contest at International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) winner on accuracy and false alarm.

In this paper, we are principally concerned with adaptive systems that operate in environments where data arrives sequentially and is multivariate in nature, for example, sensory streams in robotic systems. We contribute two reservoir inspired methods: 1) the online echostate Gaussian process (OESGP) and 2) its infinite variant, the online infinite echostate Gaussian process (OIESGP) Both algorithms are iterative fixed-budget methods that learn from noisy time series. In particular, the OESGP combines the echo-state network with Bayesian online learning for Gaussian processes. Extending this to infinite reservoirs yields the OIESGP, which uses a novel recursive kernel with automatic relevance determination that enables spatial and temporal feature weighting. When fused with stochastic natural gradient descent, the kernel hyperparameters are iteratively adapted to better model the target system. Furthermore, insights into the underlying system can be gleamed from inspection of the resulting hyperparameters. Experiments on noisy benchmark problems (one-step prediction and system identification) demonstrate that our methods yield high accuracies relative to state-of-the-art methods, and standard kernels with sliding windows, particularly on problems with irrelevant dimensions. In addition, we describe two case studies in robotic learning-by-demonstration involving the Nao humanoid robot and the Assistive Robot Transport for Youngsters (ARTY) smart wheelchair.

As such, these applications could benefit greatly from NLOS identification and mitigation techniques. These techniques have been primarily investigated for ultra-wide band (UWB) systems, but little attention has been paid to WiFi systems, which are far more prevalent in practice. In this study, we address the NLOS identification and mitigation problems using multiple received signal strength (RSS) measurements from WiFi signals. Key to our approach is exploiting several statistical features of the RSS time series, which are shown to be particularly effective. We develop and compare two algorithms based on machine learning and a third based on hypothesis testing to separate LOS/NLOS measurements. Extensive experiments in various indoor environments show that our techniques can distinguish between LOS/NLOS conditions with an accuracy of around 95%. Furthermore, the presented techniques improve distance estimation accuracy by 60% as compared to state-of-the-art NLOS mitigation techniques. Finally, improvements in distance estimation accuracy of 50% are achieved even without environment-specific training data, demonstrating the practicality of our approach to real world implementations.

Here, based on machine learning technology, we aim to explore an effective set of sequence-based features for improving prediction of SNPs by using support vector machine algorithms. The features are derived from the target residues and flanking protein sequences, such as amino acid types, sequences composition, physicochemical properties, position-specific scoring matrix, phylogenetic entropy and the number of possible codons of target residues. In order to deal with the imbalance data with a majority of non-SNPs and a minority of SNPs, a preprocessing strategy based on fuzzy set theory was applied to the datasets. Our final model achieves the performance of 93.8% in sensitivity, 88.8% in specificity, 91.3% in accuracy and 0.971 of AUC value, which is significantly higher than the previous DNA sequence-based or protein sequence-based methods. Furthermore, our study also suggested the roles of individual features for prediction of SNPs. The most important features consist of the amino acid type, the number of available codons, position-specific scoring matrix and phylogenetic entropy. The improved model will be a promising tool for SNP predictions, and assist in the research of genome mutation and personalized prescriptions.

Quantitative Prediction of Beef Quality Using Visible and NIR Spectroscopy with Large Data Samples Under Industry Conditions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						visible and near infrared spectroscopy; beef quality; principal component analysis; support vector machine; partial least squares regression	INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; LONGISSIMUS TENDERNESS; MEAT; CLASSIFICATION; ATTRIBUTES; ABILITY	It is well known that the eating quality of beef has a significant influence on the repurchase behavior of consumers. There are several key factors that affect the perception of quality, including color, tenderness, juiciness, and flavor. To support consumer repurchase choices, there is a need for an objective measurement of quality that could be applied to meat prior to its sale. Objective approaches such as offered by spectral technologies may be useful, but the analytical algorithms used remain to be optimized. For visible and near infrared (VISNIR) spectroscopy, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) is a widely used technique for meat related quality modeling and prediction. In this paper, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based machine learning approach is presented to predict beef eating quality traits. Although SVM has been successfully used in various disciplines, it has not been applied extensively to the analysis of meat quality parameters. To this end, the performance of PLSR and SVM as tools for the analysis of meat tenderness is evaluated, using a large dataset acquired under industrial conditions. The spectral dataset was collected using VISNIR spectroscopy with the wavelength ranging from 350 to 1800 nm on 234 beef M. longissimus thoracis steaks from heifers, steers, and young bulls. As the dimensionality with the VISNIR data is very high (over 1600 spectral bands), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was applied for feature extraction and data reduction. The extracted principal components (less than 100) were then used for data modeling and prediction. The prediction results showed that SVM has a greater potential to predict beef eating quality than PLSR, especially for the prediction of tenderness. The infl uence of animal gender on beef quality prediction was also investigated, and it was found that beef quality traits were predicted most accurately in beef from young bulls.

Prediction of pediatric unipolar depression using multiple neuromorphometric measurements: A pattern classification approach	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Pediatric unipolar depression; Neuroimaging; Machine learning; Support vector machine	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; MOOD DISORDERS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; MRI	Background: Diagnosis of pediatric neuropsychiatric disorders such as unipolar depression is largely based on clinical judgment - without objective biomarkers to guide diagnostic process and subsequent therapeutic interventions. Neuroimaging studies have previously reported average group-level neuroanatomical differences between patients with pediatric unipolar depression and healthy controls. In the present study, we investigated the utility of multiple neuromorphometric indices in distinguishing pediatric unipolar depression patients from healthy controls at an individual subject level. Methods: We acquired structural T-1-weighted scans from 25 pediatric unipolar depression patients and 26 demographically matched healthy controls. Multiple neuromorphometric indices such as cortical thickness, volume, and cortical folding patterns were obtained. A support vector machine pattern classification model was 'trained' to distinguish individual subjects with pediatric unipolar depression from healthy controls based on multiple neuromorphometric indices and model predictive validity (sensitivity and specificity) calculated. Results: The model correctly identified 40 out of 51 subjects translating to 78.4% accuracy, 76.0% sensitivity and 80.8% specificity, chi-square p-value = 0.000049. Volumetric and cortical folding abnormalities in the right thalamus and right temporal pole respectively were most central in distinguishing individual patients with pediatric unipolar depression from healthy controls. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that a support vector machine pattern classification model using multiple neuromorphometric indices may qualify as diagnostic marker for pediatric unipolar depression. In addition, our results identified the most relevant neuromorphometric features in distinguishing PUD patients from healthy controls. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Towards an Efficient, Intelligent, Opportunistic Smartphone Indoor Positioning System	NAVIGATION-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION			English	Article							SLAM	Many smartphone-based indoor tracking methods exist today, but to ensure consumer acceptance of such technologies, it is critical that these systems minimize their effect on the battery life of the device. Signal fingerprinting methods can provide good performance with low processing overhead but require prior surveying. Methods exploiting opportunistic sensing and machine learning techniques such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) need no prior data but come at the cost of high computational load. This paper proposes a smartphone-based indoor positioning system that exploits a new intelligent filtering approach to reduce this computational load. 'SmartSLAM' moves between different sensor fusion algorithms depending on the current level of certainty in the system, maintaining good positioning performance with low computational load, and improving battery life. This paper introduces two core algorithms underpinning SmartSLAM: the Fingerprint EKF (FEKF) and Fingerprint EKF Smoother (FEKFS).

This paper provides a better insight into Incremental Attribute Learning (IAL) with further analysis as to why it can exhibit better performance than conventional batch training. IAL is a novel supervised machine learning strategy, which gradually trains features in one or more chunks. Previous research showed that IAL can obtain lower classification error rates than a conventional batch training approach. Yet the reason for that is still not very clear. In this study, the feasibility of IAL is verified by mathematical approaches. Moreover, experimental results derived by IAL neural networks on benchmarks also confirm the mathematical validation.

Automated structural classification of lipids by machine learning	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							NOMENCLATURE JCBN NOMENCLATURE; IUB JOINT COMMISSION; RECOMMENDATIONS 1997; SHOTGUN LIPIDOMICS; GLYCOLIPIDS; DATABASE; BIOINFORMATICS; IDENTIFICATION; OBESITY; PLASMA	Motivation: Modern lipidomics is largely dependent upon structural ontologies because of the great diversity exhibited in the lipidome, but no automated lipid classification exists to facilitate this partitioning. The size of the putative lipidome far exceeds the number currently classified, despite a decade of work. Automated classification would benefit ongoing classification efforts by decreasing the time needed and increasing the accuracy of classification while providing classifications for mass spectral identification algorithms. Results: We introduce a tool that automates classification into the LIPID MAPS ontology of known lipids with >95% accuracy and novel lipids with 63% accuracy. The classification is based upon simple chemical characteristics and modern machine learning algorithms. The decision trees produced are intelligible and can be used to clarify implicit assumptions about the current LIPID MAPS classification scheme. These characteristics and decision trees are made available to facilitate alternative implementations. We also discovered many hundreds of lipids that are currently misclassified in the LIPID MAPS database, strongly underscoring the need for automated classification.

We wished to better explore performance trends by controlling data and algorithm implementation, with a particular focus on the performance of aggregate predictions. Results: Hypothesizing that popular methods would perform well without hand-tuning, we used well-characterized algorithms to produce verifiably 'untweaked' results. We find that most state-of-the-art machine learning methods obtain 'gold standard' performance as measured in critical assessments in defined tasks. Across a broad range of tests, we see close alignment in algorithm performances after controlling for the underlying data being used. We find that algorithm aggregation provides only modest benefits, with a 17% increase in area under the ROC (AUROC) above the mean AUROC. In contrast, data aggregation gains are enormous with an 88% improvement in mean AUROC. Altogether, we find substantial evidence to support the view that additional algorithm development has little to offer for gene function prediction.

The ability to predict protein-folding rates without the need for actual experimental work will assist the research work of structural biologists in many ways. Many bioinformatics tools have emerged in the past decade, and each has showcased different features. In this article, we review and compare eight web-based prediction tools that are currently available and that predominantly predict the protein-folding rate. The prediction performance, usability and utility, together with the prediction tool development and validation methodologies for these tools, are critically reviewed. This article is presented in a comprehensible manner to assist readers in the process of selecting the most appropriate bioinformatics tools to meet their needs.

Although these models could offer improved means for many network pharmacology applications, such as repositioning of drugs for new therapeutic uses, the prediction models are often being constructed and evaluated under overly simplified settings that do not reflect the real-life problem in practical applications. Using quantitative drug-target bioactivity assays for kinase inhibitors, as well as a popular benchmarking data set of binary drug-target interactions for enzyme, ion channel, nuclear receptor and G protein-coupled receptor targets, we illustrate here the effects of four factors that may lead to dramatic differences in the prediction results: (i) problem formulation (standard binary classification or more realistic regression formulation), (ii) evaluation data set (drug and target families in the application use case), (iii) evaluation procedure (simple or nested cross-validation) and (iv) experimental setting (whether training and test sets share common drugs and targets, only drugs or targets or neither). Each of these factors should be taken into consideration to avoid reporting overoptimistic drug-target interaction prediction results. We also suggest guidelines on how to make the supervised drug-target interaction prediction studies more realistic in terms of such model formulations and evaluation setups that better address the inherent complexity of the prediction task in the practical applications, as well as novel benchmarking data sets that capture the continuous nature of the drug-target interactions for kinase inhibitors.

The explosive growth in the amount of public domain-available chemical and biological data has generated huge effort to design, analyze, and apply novel learning methodologies. Here, I focus on machine-learning techniques within the context of ligand-based VS (LBVS).

J	Abid, MR; Petriu, EM; Amjadian, E				Abid, Muhammad Rizwan; Petriu, Emil M.; Amjadian, Ehsan			Dynamic Sign Language Recognition for Smart Home Interactive Application Using Stochastic Linear Formal Grammar	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Dynamic hand gesture; dynamic sign language; formal languages; image processing (IP); local part model; machine learning; stochastic linear formal grammar (SLFG); syntactic pattern recognition	HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION; VISUAL RECOGNITION; FEATURES; POSTURE; CONTEXT	This paper presents the state-of-the art dynamic sign language recognition (DSLR) system for smart home interactive applications. Our novel DSLR system comprises two main subsystems: an image processing (IP) module and a stochastic linear formal grammar (SLFG) module. Our IP module enables us to recognize the individual words of the sign language (i.e., a single gesture). In this module, we used the bag-of-features (BOFs) and a local part model approach for bare hand dynamic gesture recognition from a video. We used dense sampling to extract local 3-D multiscale whole-part features. We adopted 3-D histograms of a gradient orientation descriptor to represent features. The k-means++ method was applied to cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification was conducted using the BOFs and nonlinear support vector machine methods. We used a multiscale local part model to preserve temporal context. The SLFG module analyzes the sentences of the sign language (i.e., sequences of gestures) and determines whether or not they are syntactically valid. Therefore, the DSLR system is not only able to rule out ungrammatical sentences, but it can also make predictions about missing gestures, which, in turn, increases the accuracy of our recognition task. Our IP module alone seals the accuracy of 97% and outperforms any existing bare hand dynamic gesture recognition system. However, by exploiting syntactic pattern recognition, the SLFG module raises this accuracy by 1.65%. This makes the aggregate performance of the DSLR system as accurate as 98.65%.

Swiss HIV Cohort Study SHCS	Persistence of Transmitted HIV-1 Drug Resistance Mutations Associated with Fitness Costs and Viral Genetic Backgrounds	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS-INFECTION; REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT; VARIANTS; TRANSMISSION; PREVALENCE; AFRICA	Transmission of drug-resistant pathogens presents an almost-universal challenge for fighting infectious diseases. Transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) can persist in the absence of drugs for considerable time. It is generally believed that differential TDRM-persistence is caused, at least partially, by variations in TDRM-fitness-costs. However, in vivo epidemiological evidence for the impact of fitness costs on TDRM-persistence is rare. Here, we studied the persistence of TDRM in HIV-1 using longitudinally-sampled nucleotide sequences from the Swiss-HIV-Cohort-Study (SHCS). All treatment-naive individuals with TDRM at baseline were included. Persistence of TDRM was quantified via reversion rates (RR) determined with interval-censored survival models. Fitness costs of TDRM were estimated in the genetic background in which they occurred using a previously published and validated machine-learning algorithm (based on in vitro replicative capacities) and were included in the survival models as explanatory variables. In 857 sequential samples from 168 treatment-naive patients, 17 TDRM were analyzed. RR varied substantially and ranged from 174.0/100-person-years; CI=[51.4, 588.8] (for 184V) to 2.7/100-person-years;[0.7, 10.9] (for 215D). RR increased significantly with fitness cost (increase by 1.6[1.3,2.0] per standard deviation of fitness costs). When subdividing fitness costs into the average fitness cost of a given mutation and the deviation from the average fitness cost of a mutation in a given genetic background, we found that both components were significantly associated with reversion-rates. Our results show that the substantial variations of TDRM persistence in the absence of drugs are associated with fitness-cost differences both among mutations and among different genetic backgrounds for the same mutation.

A Comparative Assessment of Predictive Accuracies of Conventional and Machine Learning Scoring Functions for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Drug discovery; machine learning; protein-ligand binding affinity; scoring function; scoring power; virtual screening	MOLECULAR DOCKING; PDBBIND DATABASE; COMPLEXES; VALIDATION; TARGETS; SYSTEM; SET	Accurately predicting the binding affinities of large diverse sets of protein-ligand complexes efficiently is a key challenge in computational biomolecular science, with applications in drug discovery, chemical biology, and structural biology. Since a scoring function (SF) is used to score, rank, and identify potential drug leads, the fidelity with which it predicts the affinity of a ligand candidate for a protein's binding site has a significant bearing on the accuracy of virtual screening. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited predictive accuracy has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with a variety of physicochemical and geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes. We assess the scoring accuracies of these new ML SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 and 2010 PDBbind benchmark datasets on both diverse and protein-family-specific test sets. We also investigate the influence of the size of the training dataset and the type and number of features used on scoring accuracy. We find that the best performing ML SF has a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.806 between predicted and measured binding affinities compared to 0.644 achieved by a state-of-the-art conventional SF. We also find that ML SFs benefit more than their conventional counterparts from increases in the number of features and the size of training dataset. In addition, they perform better on novel proteins that they were never trained on before.

J	Li, ZH; He, Y; Wong, L; Li, JY				Li, Zhenhua; He, Ying; Wong, Limsoon; Li, Jinyan			Burial Level Change Defines a High Energetic Relevance for Protein Binding Interfaces	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Protein interface; protein binding; hot spot; O-ring	INTERACTION HOT-SPOTS; DOUBLE MUTANT CYCLES; RECOGNITION SITES; PREDICTION METHOD; COMPLEXES; SEQUENCE; MUTATIONS; DOCKING; EVOLUTION; AFFINITY	Protein-protein interfaces defined through atomic contact or solvent accessibility change are widely adopted in structural biology studies. But, these definitions cannot precisely capture energetically important regions at protein interfaces. The burial depth of an atom in a protein is related to the atom's energy. This work investigates how closely the change in burial level of an atom/residue upon complexation is related to the binding. Burial level change is different from burial level itself. An atom deeply buried in a monomer with a high burial level may not change its burial level after an interaction and it may have little burial level change. We hypothesize that an interface is a region of residues all undergoing burial level changes after interaction. By this definition, an interface can be decomposed into an onion-like structure according to the burial level change extent. We found that our defined interfaces cover energetically important residues more precisely, and that the binding free energy of an interface is distributed progressively from the outermost layer to the core. These observations are used to predict binding hot spots. Our approach's F-measure performance on a benchmark dataset of alanine mutagenesis residues is much superior or similar to those by complicated energy modeling or machine learning approaches.

Quality Assessment of Preclassification Maps Generated From Spaceborne/Airborne Multispectral Images by the Satellite Image Automatic Mapper and Atmospheric/Topographic Correction-Spectral Classification Software Products: Part 1-Theory	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Attentive vision; degree of uncertainty in measurement; land cover classification taxonomy; preattentive vision; preliminary classification; probability sampling; quality indicator (QI); radiometric calibration; spectral category; spectral mixture analysis	RADIOMETRICALLY CALIBRATED SPOT-4/-5/IRS; ART CLUSTERING NETWORKS; HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGES; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; UNDERSTANDING SYSTEMS; URBAN AREAS; SEGMENTATION; REPRESENTATION; FEATURES; LANDSAT	In compliance with the Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation (QA4EO) guidelines, the goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical comparison and an experimental quality assessment of two operational (ready-for-use) expert systems (prior knowledge-based nonadaptive decision trees) for automatic near real-time preattentional classification and segmentation of spaceborne/airborne multispectral (MS) images: the Satellite Image Automatic Mapper (TM) (SIAM (TM)) software product and the Spectral Classification of surface reflectance signatures (SPECL) secondary product of the Atmospheric/Topographic Correction (TM) (ATCOR (TM)) commercial software toolbox. For the sake of simplicity, this paper is split into two: Part 1-Theory, presented herein, and Part 2-Experimental results, already published elsewhere. The main theoretical contribution of the present Part 1 is threefold. First, it provides the published Part 2 with an interdisciplinary terminology and a theoretical background encompassing multiple disciplines, such as philosophical hermeneutics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, human vision, and remote sensing (RS). Second, it highlights the several degrees of novelty of the ATCOR-SPECL and SIAM deductive preliminary classifiers (preclassifiers) at the four levels of abstraction of an information processing system, namely, system design, knowledge/information representation, algorithms, and implementation. Third, the present Part 1 requires the experimental Part 2 to collect a minimum set of complementary statistically independent metrological quality indicators (QIs) of operativeness (QIOs), in compliance with the QA4EO guidelines and the principles of statistics. In particular, sample QIs are required to be: 1) statistically significant, i.e., provided with a degree of uncertainty in measurement; and 2) statistically valid (consistent), i.e., representative of the entire population being sampled, which requires the implementation of a probability sampling protocol. Largely overlooked by the RS community, these sample QI requirements are almost never satisfied in the RS common practice. As a consequence, to date, QIOs of existing RS image understanding systems (RS-IUSs), including thematic map accuracy, remain largely unknown in statistical terms. The conclusion of the present Part 1 is that the proposed comparison of the two alternative ATCOR-SPECL and SIAM prior knowledge-based preclassifiers in operating mode, accomplished in the Part 2, can be considered appropriate, well-timed, and of potential interest to a large portion of the RS readership.

Named Entity Disambiguation over Texts Written in the Portuguese or Spanish Languages	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Information Extraction; Named Entity Disambiguation; Supervised Machine Learning		This article addresses the problem of disambiguating named entities, in text documents, towards entries in a knowledge base like Wikipedia. The proposed approach uses supervised learning to sort candidate knowledge base entries for each entity mentioned in a text, and then to classify the entry ranked in the first position as either the correct disambiguation or not. We present results with Portuguese and Spanish texts for a wide range of models and configuration options. Our experiments attest to the effectiveness of supervised learning methods in this specific task, showing that out-of-the-box algorithms and relatively simple features can achieve a high accuracy.

The identification of amino acid residues involved in DNA-binding sites is critical for understanding the mechanism of these biological activities. In the last decade, numerous computational approaches have been developed to predict protein DNA-binding sites based on protein sequence and/or structural information, which play an important role in complementing experimental strategies. At this time, approaches can be divided into three categories: sequence-based DNA-binding site prediction, structure-based DNA-binding site prediction, and homology modeling and threading. In this article, we review existing research on computational methods to predict protein DNA-binding sites, which includes data sets, various residue sequence/structural features, machine learning methods for comparison and selection, evaluation methods, performance comparison of different tools, and future directions in protein DNA-binding site prediction. In particular, we detail the meta-analysis of protein DNA-binding sites. We also propose specific implications that are likely to result in novel prediction methods, increased performance, or practical applications.

Seasonal differences assist in mapping granite outcrops using Landsat TM imagery across the Southwest Australian Floristic Region	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE			English	Review						granite outcrops; Landsat TM; vegetation indices; habitat refuges	MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS; SPACEBORNE THERMAL EMISSION; REFLECTION RADIOMETER ASTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; BAND RATIOS; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; REFUGIA; COVER	Knowledge of the location and extent of granite outcrops (GOs) in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region is important to understand their role as refugia. We present a methodology to map GOs using biannual Landsat TM imagery. An adaptive vegetation cover mask capitalising on seasonal differences, combined with a supervised classification, allowed differentiation of granite from other land covers on five GOs across the rainfall gradient. This methodology provided high classification accuracy (Overall Kappa ranged from 0.83 to 0.91) irrespective of location. Therefore, there is potential to use these methods to compile a more complete GO inventory over the region.	[Alibegovic, G.; Robinson, T.

Probabilistic Event Calculus for Event Recognition	ACM Transactions on Computational Logic			English	Article						Complex Event Processing; Event Calculus; Markov Logic Networks; Events; probabilistic inference; machine learning; uncertainty	MARKOV LOGIC-NETWORKS; SITUATION CALCULUS; CHRONICLE RECOGNITION; MODELS; CIRCUMSCRIPTION; BEHAVIOR; VIDEO	Symbolic event recognition systems have been successfully applied to a variety of application domains, extracting useful information in the form of events, allowing experts or other systems to monitor and respond when significant events are recognised. In a typical event recognition application, however, these systems often have to deal with a significant amount of uncertainty. In this article, we address the issue of uncertainty in logic-based event recognition by extending the Event Calculus with probabilistic reasoning. Markov logic networks are a natural candidate for our logic-based formalism. However, the temporal semantics of the Event Calculus introduce a number of challenges for the proposed model. We show how and under what assumptions we can overcome these problems. Additionally, we study how probabilistic modelling changes the behaviour of the formalism, affecting its key property - the inertia of fluents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantages of the probabilistic Event Calculus through examples and experiments in the domain of activity recognition, using a publicly available dataset for video surveillance.

In terms of the envisioned methodologies, those catchphrases tend to emphasize the role of predictive analytics, that is, statistical techniques including data mining and machine learning, as well as supercomputing. Interestingly, however, while this perspective takes the availability of data as a given, it does not answer the question how one would discover the required data in today's chaotic information universe, how one would understand which data sets can be meaningfully integrated, and how to communicate the results to humans and machines alike. The semantic web addresses these questions. In the following, we argue why the data train needs semantic rails. We point out that making sense of data and gaining new insights work best if inductive and deductive techniques go hand-in-hand instead of competing over the prerogative of interpretation.

J	Sleeman, J; Finin, T; Joshi, A				Sleeman, Jennifer; Finin, Tim; Joshi, Anupam			Entity Type Recognition for Heterogeneous Semantic Graphs	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article								We describe an approach for identifying fine-grained entity types in heterogeneous data graphs that is effective for unstructured data or when the underlying ontologies or semantic schemas are unknown. Identifying fin-grained entity types, rather than a few high-level types, supports coreference resolution in heterogeneous graphs by reducing the number of possible coreference relations that must be considered. Big data problems that involve integrating data from multiple sources can benefit from our approach when the data's ontologies are unknown, inaccessible, or semantically trivial. For such cases, we use supervised machine learning to map entity attributes and relations to a known set of attributes and relations from appropriate background knowledge bases to predict instance entity types. We evaluated this approach in experiments on data from DBpedia, Freebase, and Arnetminer using DBpedia as the background knowledge base.

Statistical learning for variable annuity policyholder withdrawal behavior	APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY			English	Article						variable annuity; feature selection; machine learning; Bayesian network; rotation forest; data mining		The variable annuity product has many desirable features for retirement saving purposes, such as stock-linked growth potential, protection against losses in the investment, and guarantees of minimum payout amount at annuitization. Therefore, it is of great interest to study this product for designing next generation retirement solutions. Policyholder behavior is one of the most important profit or loss factors for the variable annuity product, and insurance companies generally do not have sophisticated models at the current time.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a relatively novel machine learning method which can be used to handle fault classification due to its good generalization ability. The PFD based on Multi Label SVM approach (MLSVM) overcomes the difficulties of the Mono Label Artificial Neural Network (MLANN) approach including the needs for a large number of data points with difficult data gathering procedure and time consuming computation. However, the existing MLSVM approach has a lower classification performance. In this paper the objective is to improve the diagnosis performance of MLSVM approach while maintaining its advantages. Therefore, a novel MLSVM approach based on multiple regulation parameters is proposed for simultaneous fault classification in a Dew Point process. The performance of the proposed MLSVM approach is compared against other classifiers approaches including MLANN and MLSVM with single regulation parameter tuning. The classification performance of the proposed approach is close to MLANN approach and superior than MLSVM with single regulation parameter. However, MLSVM has other advantages in comparison with the MLANN approach including requirement of smaller number of data, easy data gathering and lower computational burden. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Potamitis, I				Potamitis, Ilyas			Unsupervised dictionary extraction of bird vocalisations and new tools on assessing and visualising bird activity	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automatic recognition of species; Large-taxa audio classification; Ecological informatics; Computational ecology	CLASSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY	A broad range of organisations and individuals are collecting wildlife audio recordings. Huge amounts of audio data have been gathered in the past and since the popularisation of automatic recording units the data are piling up exponentially. The point in gathering them is to analyse them, evaluate insights and hypotheses, identify patterns of activity that are otherwise not apparent and finally design policies on biodiversity issues. For massive volumes of data even visual inspection of spectrograms is unfeasible and interesting cases that could provide valuable insight for concrete hypotheses on the biodiversity status can slip into bliss. In this paper we research a range of techniques that work with minor human supervision. These techniques will construct a dictionary of templates extracted in an unsupervised way from reference recordings and then crawl over a large number of recordings to examine the underlying bioacoustic activity. This work is general and we have applied it to many datasets of animal's vocalisations (e.g. cetaceans, mice, birds). To test our tools objectively and for the sake of reproducibility in this work we report on the MLSP 2013 bird dataset that recently has been publicly released along with all its annotations. We are not interested as to which is the best scoring approach for this dataset Our aim is to describe novel machine learning tools that try to refine our understanding of biodiversity by answering questions such as: Is the recording under examination void of bird vocalisations or not? If there is bird activity, how many different species are in the recording? What are the most important characteristic spectral segments for recognizing a specific species? The database however is valuable to us to quantify our findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) has come wildly alive in the pattern recognition and machine learning community. In this paper, we propose a novel method named multiple kernel learning with reproducing property (MKLRP) to achieve some classification tasks. The MKLRP consists of two major steps. First, we find the basic solution of a generalized differential operator by delta function, and prove this basic solution is a new specific reproducing kernel called H-2-reproducing kernel (HRK) in RKHS. Second, in RKHS, we prove that the HRK satisfies the condition of Mercer kernel. Furthermore, a novel specific multiple kernel learning (MKL) called MKLRP, which is based on reproducing kernel is proposed. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world data, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, their two inherited operations, namely, the crossover and mutation operations, are complicated and difficult, both in theory and in numerical implementations. In this regard, increasing efforts have been devoted to EAs which are based on probabilistic models (EAPMs) to overcome the shortcomings of available EAs. The population-based incremental learning (PBIL) is an EAPM; moreover, it can bridge the gap between machine learning and the EAs, hence enjoying several merits compared with other EAs. However, lukewarm efforts have been devoted to PBILs, especially the real coded PBILs, in the study of inverse problems in electromagnetics. In this regard, a novel real coded PBIL is being proposed in this paper. In the proposed real coded PBIL, a probability matrix is proposed to randomly generate a population, and the updating formulas for this probability matrix using the so far searched best solution and the best solution of the current population are introduced to strike a balance between convergence performance and solution quality. The proposed real coded PBIL algorithm is numerically experimented on several case studies and promising results are reported in this paper.

However, this is proving to be unfeasible over large areas. The use of remote sensing is increasingly encouraged but covering the full range of ecological variables by such datasets and ensuring compatibility with the traditional assessment methodology has not been achieved yet. We aimed to test Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as a source for mapping all variables required by the local official conservation status assessment scheme and to develop an automated method that calculates Natura 2000 conservation status at 0.5 m raster resolution for 24 km(2) of Pannonic Salt Steppe habitat (code 1530). We used multi-temporal (summer and winter) ALS point clouds with full-waveform recording and a density of 10 pt/m(2). Some required variables were derived from ALS product rasters; others involved vegetation classification layers calculated by machine learning and fuzzy categorization. Thresholds separating favorable and unfavorable values of each variable required by the national assessment scheme were manually calibrated from 10 plots where field-based assessment was carried out. Rasters representing positive and negative scores for each input variable were integrated in a ruleset that exactly follows the Hungarian Natura 2000 assessment scheme for grasslands. Accuracy of each parameter and the final conservation status score and category was evaluated by 10 independent assessment plots. We conclude that ALS is a suitable data source for Natura 2000 assessments in grasslands, and that the national grassland assessment scheme can successfully be used as a GIS processing model for conservation status, ensuring that the output is directly comparable with traditional field based assessments.

Examining the Capability of Supervised Machine Learning Classifiers in Extracting Flooded Areas from Landsat TM Imagery: A Case Study from a Mediterranean Flood	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; OPEN WATER FEATURES; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; INDEX NDWI; ETM PLUS; CLASSIFICATION; RIVER; MANAGEMENT; GIS; RISK	This study explored the capability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and regularised kernel Fisher's discriminant analysis (rkFDA) machine learning supervised classifiers in extracting flooded area from optical Landsat TM imagery. The ability of both techniques was evaluated using a case study of a riverine flood event in 2010 in a heterogeneous Mediterranean region, for which TM imagery acquired shortly after the flood event was available. For the two classifiers, both linear and non-linear (kernel) versions were utilised in their implementation. The ability of the different classifiers to map the flooded area extent was assessed on the basis of classification accuracy assessment metrics. Results showed that rkFDA outperformed SVMs in terms of accurate flooded pixels detection, also producing fewer missed detections of the flooded area. Yet, SVMs showed less false flooded area detections. Overall, the non-linear rkFDA classification method was the more accurate of the two techniques (OA = 96.23%, K = 0.877). Both methods outperformed the standard Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) thresholding (OA = 94.63, K = 0.818) by roughly 0.06 K points. Although overall accuracy results for the rkFDA and SVMs classifications only showed a somewhat minor improvement on the overall accuracy exhibited by the NDWI thresholding, notably both classifiers considerably outperformed the thresholding algorithm in other specific accuracy measures (e.g. producer accuracy for the "not flooded" class was ~10.5% less accurate for the NDWI thresholding algorithm in comparison to the classifiers, and average per-class accuracy was ~5% less accurate than the machine learning models). This study provides evidence of the successful application of supervised machine learning for classifying flooded areas in Landsat imagery, where few studies so far exist in this direction. Considering that Landsat data is open access and has global coverage, the results of this study offers important information towards exploring the possibilities of the use of such data to map other significant flood events from space in an economically viable way.

The use of smart computational methods in the life cycle of drug design is relatively a recent development that has gained much popularity and interest over the last few years. Central to this methodology is the notion of computational docking which is the process of predicting the best pose (orientation + conformation) of a small molecule (drug candidate) when bound to a target larger receptor molecule (protein) in order to form a stable complex molecule. In computational docking, a large number of binding poses are evaluated and ranked using a scoring function. The scoring function is a mathematical predictive model that produces a score that represents the binding free energy, and hence the stability, of the resulting complex molecule. Generally, such a function should produce a set of plausible ligands ranked according to their binding stability along with their binding poses. In more practical terms, an effective scoring function should produce promising drug candidates which can then be synthesized and physically screened using high throughput screening process. Therefore, the key to computer-aided drug design is the design of an efficient highly accurate scoring function (using ML techniques). Methods: The methods presented in this paper are specifically based on ML techniques. Despite many traditional techniques have been proposed, the performance was generally poor. Only in the last few years started the application of the ML technology in the design of scoring functions; and the results have been very promising. Material: The ML-based techniques are based on various molecular features extracted from the abundance of protein-ligand information in the public molecular databases, e.g., protein data bank bind (PDBbind). Results: In this paper, we present this paradigm shift elaborating on the main constituent elements of the ML approach to molecular docking along with the state-of-the-art research in this area. For instance, the best random forest (RF)-based scoring function 1351 on PDBbind v2007 achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and experimentally determined binding affinities of 0.803 while the best conventional scoring function achieves 0.644 [34]. The best RF-based ranking power [6] ranks the ligands correctly based on their experimentally determined binding affinities with accuracy 62.5% and identifies the top binding ligand with accuracy 78.1%. Conclusions: We conclude with open questions and potential future research directions that can be pursued in smart computational docking; using molecular features of different nature (geometrical, energy terms, pharmacophore), advanced ML techniques (e.g., deep learning), combining more than one ML models.

Planning of postoperative ICU admissions is important as ICUs often have no nonoccupied beds available. Problem statement: Estimation of the ICU bed availability for the next coming days is entirely based on clinical judgement by intensivists and therefore too inaccurate. For this reason, predictive models have much potential for improving planning for ICU patient admission. Objective: Our goal is to develop and optimize models for patient survival and ICU length of stay (LOS) based on monitored ICU patient data. Furthermore, these models are compared on their use of sequential organ failure (SOFA) scores as well as underlying raw data as input features. Methodology: Different machine learning techniques are trained, using a 14,480 patient dataset, both on SOFA scores as well as their underlying raw data values from the first five days after admission, in order to predict (i) the patient LOS, and (ii) the patient mortality. Furthermore, to help physicians in assessing the prediction credibility, a probabilistic model is tailored to the output of our best-performing model, assigning a belief to each patient status prediction. A two-by-two grid is built, using the classification outputs of the mortality and prolonged stay predictors to improve the patient LOS regression models. Results: For predicting patient mortality and a prolonged stay, the best performing model is a support vector machine (SVM) with G(A,D) = 65.9% (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77) and G(S,L) = 73.2% (AUC of 0.82). In terms of LOS regression, the best performing model is support vector regression, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.79 days and a median absolute error of 1.22 days for those patients surviving a nonprolonged stay. Conclusion: Using a classification grid based on the predicted patient mortality and prolonged stay, allows more accurate modeling of the patient LOS. The detailed models allow to support the decisions made by physicians in an ICU setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Algorithms capable of recognizing facial expressions and associating them with emotions were developed and employed to compare the expressions that different cultural groups use to show their emotions. Static pictures of predominantly occidental and oriental subjects from public datasets were used to train machine learning algorithms, whereas local binary patterns, histogram of oriented gradients (HOGs), and Gabor filters were employed to describe the facial expressions for six different basic emotions. The most consistent combination, formed by the association of HOG filter and support vector machines, was then used to classify the other cultural group: there was a strong drop in accuracy, meaning that the subtle differences of facial expressions of each culture affected the classifier performance. Finally, a classifier was trained with images from both occidental and oriental subjects and its accuracy was higher on multicultural data, evidencing the need of a multicultural training set to build an efficient classifier.

Genome-wide gene network organizing principles leading to quantitative differences between PTI and ETI have remained elusive. We combined an advanced machine learning method and modular network analysis to systematically characterize the organizing principles of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PTI and ETI at three network resolutions. At the single network node/edge level, we ranked genes and gene interactions based on their ability to distinguish immune response from normal growth and successfully identified many immune-related genes associated with PTI and ETI. Topological analysis revealed that the top-ranked gene interactions tend to link network modules. At the subnetwork level, we identified a subnetwork shared by PTI and ETI encompassing 1,159 genes and 1,289 interactions. This subnetwork is enriched in interactions linking network modules and is also a hotspot of attack by pathogen effectors. The subnetwork likely represents a core component in the coordination of multiple biological processes to favor defense over development. Finally, we constructed modular network models for PTI and ETI to explain the quantitative differences in the global network architecture. Our results indicate that the defense modules in ETI are organized into relatively independent structures, explaining the robustness of ETI to genetic mutations and effector attacks.

In this scheme, the discrete wavelet transform is applied on EEG signals and the relative wavelet energy is calculated in terms of detailed coefficients and the approximation coefficients of the last decomposition level. The extracted relative wavelet energy features are passed to classifiers for the classification purpose. The EEG dataset employed for the validation of the proposed method consisted of two classes: (1) the EEG signals recorded during the complex cognitive task-Raven's advance progressive metric test and (2) the EEG signals recorded in rest condition-eyes open. The performance of four different classifiers was evaluated with four performance measures, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision values. The accuracy was achieved above 98 % by the support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron and the K-nearest neighbor classifiers with approximation (A4) and detailed coefficients (D4), which represent the frequency range of 0.53-3.06 and 3.06-6.12 Hz, respectively. The findings of this study demonstrated that the proposed feature extraction approach has the potential to classify the EEG signals recorded during a complex cognitive task by achieving a high accuracy rate.

Most P. aeruginosa strains encode an active type III secretion system (T3SS), utilized by the bacteria to deliver effector proteins from the bacterial cell directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell. Four T3SS effectors have been discovered and extensively studied in P. aeruginosa: ExoT, ExoS, ExoU, and ExoY. This is especially intriguing in light of P. aeruginosa's ability to infect a wide range of hosts. We therefore hypothesized that additional T3SS effectors that have not yet been discovered are encoded in the genome of P. aeruginosa. Here, we applied a machine learning classification algorithm to identify novel P. aeruginosa effectors. In this approach, various types of data are integrated to differentiate effectors from the rest of the open reading frames of the bacterial genome. Due to the lack of a sufficient learning set of positive effectors, our machine learning algorithm integrated genomic information from another Pseudomonas species and utilized dozens of features accounting for various aspects of the effector coding genes and their products. Twelve top-ranking predictions were experimentally tested for T3SS-specific translocation, leading to the discovery of two novel T3SS effectors. We demonstrate that these effectors are not part of the injection structural complex and report initial efforts toward their characterization. IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to secrete toxic proteins, termed effectors, directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The activation of this secretion system is correlated with disease severity and patient death. Compared with many other T3SS-utilizing pathogenic bacteria, P. aeruginosa has a fairly limited arsenal of effectors that have been identified. This is in sharp contrast with the wide range of hosts that this bacterium can infect. The discovery of two novel effectors described here is an important step toward better understanding of the virulence and host evasion mechanisms adopted by this versatile pathogen and may provide novel approaches to treat P. aeruginosa infections.

CDSSs are a widely researched topic in the Computer Science community but their workings are less well understood by clinicians. The purpose of this review is to introduce clinicians and policy makers to the most commonly computer-based methodologies employed to construct decision models to compute clinical decisions in a non-technical manner. We hope that a better understanding of CDSSs will open up discussion about the future of CDSSs as a part of healthcare delivery as well as engage clinicians and policy makers in the development and deployment of CDSSs that can meaningfully help with decision making tasks.

A generalized framework for medical image classification and recognition	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							SYSTEMS; RETRIEVAL; FEATURES; TEXTURE	In this work, we study the performance of a two-stage ensemble visual machine learning framework for classification of medical images. In the first stage, models are built for subsets of features and data, and in the second stage, models are combined. We demonstrate the performance of this framework in four contexts: 1) The public ImageCLEF (Cross Language Evaluation Forum) 2013 medical modality recognition benchmark, 2) echocardiography view and mode recognition, 3) dermatology disease recognition across two datasets, and 4) a broad medical image dataset, merged from multiple data sources into a collection of 158 categories covering both general and specific medical concepts-including modalities, body regions, views, and disease states. In the first context, the presented system achieves state-of-art performance of 82.2% multiclass accuracy. In the second context, the system attains 90.48% multiclass accuracy. In the third, state-of-art performance of 90% specificity and 90% sensitivity is obtained on a small standardized dataset of 200 images using a leave-one-out strategy. For a larger dataset of 2,761 images, 95% specificity and 98% sensitivity is obtained on a 20% held-out test set. Finally, in the fourth context, the system achieves sensitivity and specificity of 94.7% and 98.4%, respectively, demonstrating the ability to generalize over domains.

Massive-scale learning of image and video semantic concepts	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Rapid growth in the capture and generation of images and videos is driving the need for more efficient and effective systems for analyzing, searching, and retrieving this data. Specific challenges include supporting automatic content indexing at a large scale and accurately extracting a sufficiently large number of relevant semantic concepts to enable effective search. In this paper, we describe the development of a system for massive-scale visual semantic concept extraction and learning for images and video. The system models the visual semantic space using a hierarchical faceted classification scheme across objects, scenes, people, activities, and events and utilizes a novel machine learning approach that creates ensemble classifiers from automatically extracted visual features. The ensemble learning and extraction processes are easily parallelizable for distributed processing using Hadoop (R) and IBM InfoSphere (R) Streams, which enable efficient processing of large data sets. We report on various applications and quantitative and qualitative results for different image and video data sets.	[Smith, J. R.; Cao, L.; Codella, N. C. F.; Hill, M.

J	Shirakawa, S				Shirakawa, Shinichi			Multiple Binary Codes for Fast Approximate Similarity Search	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						similarity search; binary hash; approximate nearest neighbor search; machine learning; image retrieval		One of the fast approximate similarity search techniques is a binary hashing method that transforms a real-valued vector into a binary code. The similarity between two binary codes is measured by their Hamming distance. In this method, a hash table is often used when undertaking a constant-time similarity search. The number of accesses to the hash table, however, increases when the number of bits lengthens. In this paper, we consider a method that does not access data with a long Hamming radius by using multiple binary codes. Further, we attempt to integrate the proposed approach and the existing multi-index hashing (MIH) method to accelerate the performance of the similarity search in the Hamming space. Then, we propose a learning method of the binary hash functions for multiple binary codes. We conduct an experiment on similarity search utilizing a dataset of up to 50 million items and show that our proposed method achieves a faster similarity search than that possible with the conventional linear scan and hash table search.

At the core of our algorithms are fast and coherent quantum methods for computing the Euclidean distance both directly and via the inner product which we couple with methods for performing amplitude estimation that do not require measurement. We prove upper bounds on the number of queries to the input data required to compute such distances and find the nearest vector to a given test example. In the worst case, our quantum algorithms lead to polynomial reductions in query complexity relative to Monte Carlo algorithms. We also study the performance of our quantum nearest-neighbor algorithms on several real-world binary classification tasks and find that the classification accuracy is competitive with classical methods.

Its performance sensitivity to the number of hidden neurons is studied under the context of hyperspectral remote sensing image classification. An empirical linear relationship between the number of training samples and the number of hidden neurons is proposed. Such a relationship can be easily estimated with two small training sets and extended to large training sets to greatly reduce computational cost. The kernel version of ELM (KELM) is also implemented with the radial basis function kernel, and such a linear relationship is still suitable. The experimental results demonstrated that when the number of hidden neurons is appropriate, the performance of ELM may be slightly lower than the linear SVM, but the performance of KELM can be comparable to the kernel version of SVM (KSVM). The computational cost of ELM and KELM is much lower than that of the linear SVM and KSVM, respectively.

These learning based controllers are graphically designed by the user, interconnecting four kinds of components: Global Goals, Acting Modules, Sensing Modules and Sensations. Global Goals specify the intrinsic motivations, Acting and Sensing Modules develop their respective functionalities while Sensations provide the controlled system's feedback. GFM Controllers engage in a learning process to satisfy the specified motivations while interacting with the environment and thus can be considered as artificial brains. The traditional systems programming task is replaced by a design phase that consists in graphically configuring and interconnecting the GFM components. This paper gives a description of the aforementioned components and of their specific roles in the learning based control process. The behavior of the controller and its components is exemplified with the characterization of a simple control application. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The atherosclerotic process is a complex degenerative condition mainly affecting the medium- and large-size arteries, which begins in childhood and may remain unnoticed during decades. It causes thickening and the reduction of elasticity in the blood vessels. An early diagnosis of this condition is crucial to prevent patients from suffering more serious pathologies (heart attacks and strokes). The evaluation of the Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) of the Common Carotid Artery (CCA) in B-mode ultrasound images is considered the most useful tool for the investigation of preclinical atherosclerosis. Usually, it is manually measured by the radiologists. This paper proposes a fully automatic segmentation technique based on Machine Learning and Statistical Pattern Recognition to measure IMT from ultrasound CCA images. The pixels are classified by means of artificial neural networks to identify the IMT boundaries. Moreover, the concepts of Auto-Encoders (AE) and Deep Learning have been included in the classification strategy. The suggested approach is tested on a set of 55 longitudinal ultrasound images of the CCA by comparing the automatic segmentation with four manual tracings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An algorithm framework of sparse minimization is proposed for PDQF. It is theoretically analyzed to converge to global minimum. The computational complexity is analyzed and compared with the state-of-the-art Fast Iterative ShrinkageThresholding Algorithm (FISTA). Some well-known machine learning and pattern recognition methods are illustrated to be optimized by the proposed algorithm framework. Illustrative experiments show that Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) via the proposed method converges much faster than several classical methods.

As industrial technology has developed a lot, new fault diagnosis methods are needed to distinguish faults with only fine distinctions. The higher quality a production is required to have, the better fault diagnosis method the factories should apply. A fault diagnosis method based on modified Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is shown in this paper. With this method, dimension of samples is effectively reduced by recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm, and computing time is saved at the same time. Besides, classification accuracy is improved by parameter optimizing and sample size balancing strategy. A faults dataset of steel plates is taken as a practical case. And SVMs that are modified by different algorithms are utilized to complete fault diagnosis. This combined measure shows its superiority in sorting common faults of steel plates over original SVMs. Some essential procedures in model developing, such as normalization and cross validation, are also referred to.

The choice of feature subset determines the classification accuracy. It is a crucial aspect to construct efficient feature selection algorithm. Here, by constructing the feature vector graph, a new feature evaluation criterion based on community modularity in complex network is proposed to select the most informative features. To eliminate the relevant redundancy among features, conditional mutual information-based criterion is used to capture information about relevant independency between features, which is the amount of information they can predict about label variable, but they do not share. The most informative features with maximum relevant independency are added to the optimal subset. Integrating these two points, a method named the community modularity Q value-based feature selection (CMQFS) is put forward in this paper. Furthermore, our method based on community modularity can be certified by k-means cluster theory. We compared the proposed algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods by several experiments to indicate that CMQFS is more efficient and accurate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dynamic neural network architecture inspired by the immune algorithm to predict preterm deliveries in pregnant women	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Term delivery; Preterm delivery; Machine learning; Classification; Neural networks; Electrohysterography	UTERINE EMG SIGNALS; FREQUENCY-RELATED PARAMETERS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ABDOMINAL SURFACE; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; LABOR; BIRTH; TERM	There has been some improvement in the treatment of preterm infants, which has helped to increase their chance of survival. However, the rate of premature births is still globally increasing. As a result, this group of infants is most at risk of developing severe medical conditions that can affect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, central nervous, auditory and visual systems. There is a strong body of evidence emerging that suggests the analysis of uterine electrical signals, from the abdominal surface (Electrohysterography - EHG), could provide a viable way of diagnosing true labour and even predict preterm deliveries. This paper explores this idea further and presents a new dynamic self-organized network immune algorithm that classifies term and preterm records, using an open dataset containing 300 records (38 preterm and 262 term). Using the dataset, oversampling and cross validation techniques are evaluated against other similar studies. The proposed approach shows an improvement on existing studies with 89% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 90% positive predicted value, 90% negative predicted value, and an overall accuracy of 90%.

An integrated approach to region based image retrieval using firefly algorithm and support vector machine	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Region-based image retrieval; Support vector machine; Firefly algorithm; Gaussian distribution; Particle swarm optimization; Genetic algorithm	RELEVANCE FEEDBACK; MULTIMEDIA RETRIEVAL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; PATTERNS; FRAMEWORK; FEATURES; SEGMENTATION; EFFICIENT	Intelligent image retrieval is a challenging technology in multimedia applications where bridging the gap between user's expectation and low level features is typically hard for computing systems. In the proposed approach, a unique method is projected which integrates support vector machine based learning with an evolutionary stochastic algorithm, called firefly algorithm as a relevance feedback approach into a region based image retrieval system. This system overcomes the semantic gap through optimized iterative learning and also provides a better exploration of solution space. Support vector machine learning automatically updates the weights of preferences for relevant images based on the both relevant and irrelevant feedback images. The firefly optimizer guides the swarm agents to move towards the cluster of relevant images in the exploration of the search space based on user's feedback. This research study has a focused approach to increase the performance by optimizing region feature with the firefly algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed approach is experimented on the standard subset of Corel, Caltech and Pascal database images. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with other existing retrieval methods like particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, support vector machine and query point movement to identify the excellence with regard to the model in terms of precision and recall.

The imprecise Dirichlet model as a basis for a new boosting classification algorithm	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Machine learning; Classification; Boosting; AdaBoost; Imprecise Dirichlet model; Extreme points	MULTINOMIAL DATA; CLASSIFIERS	A new algorithm for ensemble construction based on adapted restricting a set of weights of examples in training data to avoid overfitting and to reduce a number of iterations is proposed in the paper. The algorithm called IDMBoost (Imprecise Dirichlet Model Boost) applies Walley's imprecise Dirichlet model for modifying the restricted sets of weights depending on the number and location of classification errors. Updating of weights within the restricted set (simplex) is carried out by using its extreme points. The proposed algorithm has a double adaptation procedure. The first adaptation is carried out within every restricted simplex like the AdaBoost The second adaptation reduces and changes the restricted sets of possible weights of examples. Various numerical experiments with real data illustrate the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, it is widely recognized that ELM has speed advantage while performing satisfying results. However, the presence of outliers may give rise to unreliable ELM model. In this paper, our study addresses the outlier robustness of ELM in regression problems. Based on the sparsity characteristic of outliers, this work proposes an outlier-robust ELM where the l(1)-norm loss function is used to enhance the robustness. Specially, the fast and accurate augmented Iagrangian multiplier method is applied to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency. According to the experiments on function approximation and some real-world applications, the proposed approach not only maintains the advantages from original ELM, but also shows notable and stable accuracy in handling data with outliers.

Tahe lesson of causal discovery algorithms for quantum correlations: causal explanations of Bell-inequality violations require fine-tuning	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						Bell's theorem; nonlocality; causality; quantum theory	MODELS; UNCERTAINTY; ORIGIN	An active area of research in the fields of machine learning and statistics is the development of causal discovery algorithms, the purpose of which is to infer the causal relations that hold among a set of variables from the correlations that these exhibit. We apply some of these algorithms to the correlations that arise for entangled quantum systems. We show that they cannot distinguish correlations that satisfy Bell inequalities from correlations that violate Bell inequalities, and consequently that they cannot do justice to the challenges of explaining certain quantum correlations causally. Nonetheless, by adapting the conceptual tools of causal inference, we can show that any attempt to provide a causal explanation of nonsignalling correlations that violate a Bell inequality must contradict a core principle of these algorithms, namely, that an observed statistical independence between variables should not be explained by fine-tuning of the causal parameters. In particular, we demonstrate the need for such fine-tuning for most of the causal mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie Bell correlations, including	[Wood, Christopher J.] Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Wood, Christopher J.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Phys & Astron, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Spekkens, Robert W.] Perimeter Inst Theoret Phys, Waterloo, ON N2L 2Y5, Canada	Wood, CJ (reprint author), Inst Quantum Comp, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.	rspekkens@perimeterinstitute.ca			Government of Canada through NSERC; Province of Ontario through MRI	RWS thanks Matthew Leifer for having introduced him to causal networks and for discussions on the ideas in this article.

In the current literature, black-box identification has been widely used for diesel engine modelling and many artificial neural network (ANN) based models have been developed. However, ANN has many drawbacks such as multiple local minima, user burden on selection of optimal network structure, large training data size, and over-fitting risk. To overcome these drawbacks, this article proposes to apply an emerging machine learning technique, relevance vector machine (RVM), to model and predict the diesel engine performance. The property of global optimal solution of RVM allows the model to be trained using only a few experimental data sets. In this study, the inputs of the model are engine speed, load, and cooling water temperature, while the output parameters are the brake-specific fuel consumption and the amount of exhaust emissions like nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. Experimental results show that the model accuracy is satisfactory even the training data is scarce. Moreover, the model accuracy is compared with that using typical ANN. Evaluation results also show that RVM is superior to typical ANN approach.

The proposed approach is named as ABC-based distance-weighted kNN (dW-ABC kNN). The main idea of the hybrid algorithm is to assign random weights over sorted distances of kNN and to find the optimal weights, which achieve better classification performance. ABC algorithm carries out the weight determination operation. To evaluate the results, the data-sets from UCI machine learning repository are used. The classification performance of the dW-ABC kNN is compared with distance-weighted kNN (dW-kNN) and equally weighted kNN (eW-kNN) algorithms. The numerical simulations show that dW-ABC kNN always outperforms eW-kNN approach. It improves the correct classification performance of dW kNN in most data-sets, especially at small values of k. Experimental results confirm the merit of dW-ABC kNN approach.

Here, the experimental studies are conducted in two different stages. In the first stage, different concepts of machine learning systems are taken into account to find a simple yet accurate intelligent model for identifying the LSFF process. To do so, multi-layered neural network with different types of analytical, gradient-based and heuristic learning strategies, i.e. extreme learning machine, back-propagation and steepest descend gradient-based learning and Nelder-Mead simplex heuristic, respectively, are adopted and applied to the LSFF process. In the second stage, different types of swarm- and evolutionary-based metaheuristics, i.e. differential evolutionary algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, the great salmon run, firefly algorithm, bee algorithm, are used to simultaneously find the optimal values of melt-pool depth and clad height during the LSFF process. The statistical results of the simulation indicate that the conducted experiments can result in a fast, robust and accurate hybrid intelligent system which can easily cope with the nonlinearities and uncertainties of the resulting optimisation problem.

This paper reviews the application of these methods to the problem domain of skin permeability and addresses critically some of the key issues. Specifically, ML methods offer great potential in both predictive ability and their ability to provide mechanistic insight to, in this case, the phenomena of skin permeation. However, they are beset by perceptions of a lack of transparency and, often, once a ML or related method has been published there is little impetus from other researchers to adopt such methods. This is usually due to the lack of transparency in some methods and the lack of availability of specific coding for running advanced ML methods. This paper reviews critically the application of ML methods to percutaneous absorption and addresses the key issue of transparency by describing in detail - and providing the detailed coding for - the process of running a ML method (in this case, a Gaussian process regression method). Although this method is applied here to the field of percutaneous absorption, it may be applied more broadly to any biological system.

In this contribution, we present a machine learning approach for detecting, estimating, and compensating for such external perturbations using only input from standard sensors. This machine learning approach makes use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a data processing technique developed in the field of fluid dynamics, which is applied to robotics for the first time. DMD is able to isolate the dynamics of a nonlinear system and is therefore well suited for separating noise from regular oscillations in sensor readings during cyclic robot movements. In a training phase, a DMD model for behavior-specific parameter configurations is learned. During task execution, the robot must estimate the external forces exerted by a human interaction partner. We compare the DMD-based approach to other interpolation schemes. A variant, sparsity promoting DMD, is particularly well suited for high-noise sensors. Results of a user study show that our DMD-based machine learning approach can be used to design physical human-robot interaction techniques that not only result in robust robot behavior but also enjoy a high usability.

As fast ice plays an important role in the environmental and biological systems of the Antarctic, it is crucial to accurately monitor the spatiotemporal distribution of fast ice. Previous studies on fast ice using satellite remote sensing were mostly focused on the Arctic and near-Arctic areas, whereas few studies were conducted over the Antarctic, especially the West Antarctic region. This research mapped fast ice using multisensor data from 2003 to 2008 based on machine learning approaches - decision trees (DTs) and random forest (RF). A total of seven satellite-derived products, including Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system brightness temperatures and sea ice concentration, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice surface temperature (IST) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager ice velocity, were used as input variables for identifying fast ice. RF resulted in better performance than that of DT for fast ice classification. Visual comparison of the fast ice classification results with 250-m MODIS images for selected areas also revealed that RF outperformed DT. Ice velocity and IST were identified as the most contributing variables to classify fast ice. Spatiotemporal variations of fast ice in the East and West Antarctic were also examined using the time series of the fast ice maps produced by RF. The residence time of fast ice was much shorter in the West Antarctic than in the East.

A robust safety-oriented autonomous cruise control scheme for electric vehicles based on model predictive control and online sequential extreme learning machine with a hyper-level fault tolerance-based supervisor	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Electric vehicles; Autonomous cruise control; Model predictive control; Online sequential extreme learning machine; Hyper-level fault-tolerance based supervisor	AIR/FUEL RATIO CONTROL; FUEL-ECONOMY; MANAGEMENT	In this investigation, an advanced modeling method, called online sequential extreme learning machine with a hyper-level fault tolerance-based supervisor (OSELM-FTS), is utilized to develop a robust safety-oriented autonomous cruise control based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique. The resulting MPC-based cruise controller is used to improve the driving safety and reduce the energy consumption of an electric vehicle (EV). The structural flexibility of OSELM-FTS allows us to not only improve the operating features of the EV, but also develop an intelligent supervisor which can detect any operating fault and send proper commands for the adaption of the MPC controller. This introduces a degree of robustness to the devised controller, as OSELM-FTS automatically detects and filters any operating faults which may undermine the performance of the MPC controller. To ascertain the veracity of the devised controller, three well-known MPC formulations, i.e. linear MPC (LMPC) and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) and diagonal recurrent neural network MPC (DRNN-MPC), are applied to the baseline EV and their performances are compared with OSELM-FTS-MPC. To further elaborate on the computational advantages of OSELM, a well-known chunk-by-chunk incremental machine learning approach, namely selective negative correlation learning (SNCL), is taken into account. The results of the comparative study indicate that OSELM-FTS-MPC is a very promising control scheme and can be reliably used for safety-oriented autonomous cruise control of the EVs.

PsychoGenics developed three comprehensive high-throughput systems, SmartCube (R) NeuroCube (R) and PhenoCube (R) systems, to increase the efficiency of the drug screening and phenotyping in rodents. These three systems capture different domains of behavior, namely, cognitive, motor, circadian, social, anxiety-like, gait and others, using custom-built computer vision software and machine learning algorithms for analysis. This review exemplifies the use of the three systems and explains how they can advance drug screening with their applications to phenotyping of disease models, drug screening, selection of lead candidates, behavior-driven lead optimization, and drug repurposing.

In addition, the support vector regression (SVR) variant is widely used for numerical property predictions. In chemoinformatics and pharmaceutical research, SVR has become the probably most popular approach for modeling of non-linear structure-activity relationships (SARs) and predicting compound potency values. Herein, we have systematically generated and analyzed SVR prediction models for a variety of compound data sets with different SAR characteristics. Although these SVR models were accurate on the basis of global prediction statistics and not prone to overfitting, they were found to consistently mispredict highly potent compounds. Hence, in regions of local SAR discontinuity, SVR prediction models displayed clear limitations. Compared to observed activity landscapes of compound data sets, landscapes generated on the basis of SVR potency predictions were partly flattened and activity cliff information was lost. Taken together, these findings have implications for practical SVR applications. In particular, prospective SVR-based potency predictions should be considered with caution because artificially low predictions are very likely for highly potent candidate compounds, the most important prediction targets.

Enhancing physiologic simulations using supervised learning on coarse mesh solutions	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						computational modelling; machine learning; Gaussian process; nearest neighbours; drug-coated balloons; drug-eluting stents	FRACTIONAL FLOW RESERVE; DRUG-ELUTING STENTS; CORONARY-ARTERY; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; FINITE-ELEMENT; SHEAR-STRESS; LARGE-SCALE; PACLITAXEL; MODELS	Computational modelling of physical and biochemical processes has emerged as a means of evaluating medical devices, offering new insights that explain current performance, inform future designs and even enable personalized use. Yet resource limitations force one to compromise with reduced order computational models and idealized assumptions that yield either qualitative descriptions or approximate, quantitative solutions to problems of interest. Considering endovascular drug delivery as an exemplary scenario, we used a supervised machine learning framework to process data generated from low fidelity coarse meshes and predict high fidelity solutions on refined mesh configurations. We considered two models simulating drug delivery to the arterial wall: (i) two-dimensional drug-coated balloons and (ii) three-dimensional drug-eluting stents. Simulations were performed on computational mesh configurations of increasing density. Supervised learners based on Gaussian process modelling were constructed from combinations of coarse mesh setting solutions of drug concentrations and nearest neighbourhood distance information as inputs, and higher fidelity mesh solutions as outputs. These learners were then used as computationally inexpensive surrogates to extend predictions using low fidelity information to higher levels of mesh refinement. The cross-validated, supervised learner-based predictions improved fidelity as compared with computational simulations performed at coarse level meshes-a result consistent across all outputs and computational models considered. Supervised learning on coarse mesh solutions can augment traditional physics-based modelling of complex physiologic phenomena. By obtaining efficient solutions at a fraction of the computational cost, this framework has the potential to transform how modelling approaches can be applied in the evaluation of medical technologies and their real-time administration in an increasingly personalized fashion.

Forces on atoms are either predicted by Bayesian inference or, if necessary, computed by on-the-fly quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations and added to a growing ML database, whose completeness is, thus, never required. As a result, the scheme is accurate and general, while progressively fewer QM calls are needed when a new chemical process is encountered for the second and subsequent times, as demonstrated by tests on crystalline and molten silicon.

In general, according to the 10 attribute weighting models, the SSR alleles of PEAPHTAP-2 and PSBLOX13.2-1 were the two most important attributes to generate discrimination among eight different species and subspecies of genus Pisum. In addition, K-Medoids unsupervised clustering run on Chi squared dataset exhibited the best prediction accuracy (83.12%), while the lowest accuracy (25.97%) gained as K-Means model ran on FCdb database. Irrespective of some fluctuations, the overall accuracies of tree induction models were significantly high for many algorithms, and the attributes PSBLOX13.2-3 and PEAPHTAP could successfully detach Pisum fulvum accessions and cultivars from the others when two selected decision trees were taken into account. Meanwhile, the other used supervised algorithms exhibited overall reliable accuracies, even though in some rare cases, they gave us low amounts of accuracies. Our results, altogether, demonstrate promising applications of both supervised and unsupervised algorithms to provide suitable data mining tools regarding accurate fingerprinting of different species and subspecies of genus Pisum, as a fundamental priority task in breeding programs of the crop.

Here, we deconstruct the face patterns of a tribe of primates, the guenons (Cercopithecini), and examine the information that is potentially available in the perceptual dimensions of their multicomponent displays. Using standardized colour-calibrated images of guenon faces, we measure variation in appearance both within and between species. Overall face pattern was quantified using the computer vision 'eigenface' technique, and eyebrow and nose-spot focal traits were described using computational image segmentation and shape analysis. Discriminant function analyses established whether these perceptual dimensions could be used to reliably classify species identity, individual identity, age and sex, and, if so, identify the dimensions that carry this information. Across the 12 species studied, we found that both overall face pattern and focal trait differences could be used to categorize species and individuals reliably, whereas correct classification of age category and sex was not possible. This pattern makes sense, as guenons often form mixed-species groups in which familiar conspecifics develop complex differentiated social relationships but where the presence of heterospecifics creates hybridization risk. Our approach should be broadly applicable to the investigation of visual signal function across the animal kingdom.

Electrode replacement does not affect classification accuracy in dual-session use of a passive brain-computer interface for assessing cognitive workload	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						passive brain computer interface; cognitive state; electroencephalography; machine learning; non-stationarity	FUNCTIONAL-STATE CLASSIFICATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES; ADAPTIVE AUTOMATION; DETECTION ALGORITHM; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; TASK-DIFFICULTY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MOTOR IMAGERY; SYSTEM	The passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) framework has been shown to be a very promising construct for assessing cognitive and affective state in both individuals and teams. There is a growing body of work that focuses on solving the challenges of transitioning pBCI systems from the research laboratory environment to practical, everyday use. An interesting issue is what impact methodological variability may have on the ability to reliably identify (neuro)physiological patterns that are useful for state assessment. This work aimed at quantifying the effects of methodological variability in a pBCI design for detecting changes in cognitive workload. Specific focus was directed toward the effects of replacing electrodes over dual sessions (thus inducing changes in placement, electromechanical properties, and/or impedance between the electrode and skin surface) on the accuracy of several machine learning approaches in a binary classification problem. In investigating these methodological variables, it was determined that the removal and replacement of the electrode suite between sessions does not impact the accuracy of a number of learning approaches when trained on one session and tested on a second. This finding was confirmed by comparing to a control group for which the electrode suite was not replaced between sessions. This result suggests that sensors (both neurological and peripheral) may be removed and replaced over the course of many interactions with a pBCI system without affecting its performance. Future work on multi-session and multi-day pBCI system use should seek to replicate this (lack of) effect between sessions in other tasks, temporal time courses, and data analytic approaches while also focusing on non-stationarity and variable classification performance due to intrinsic factors.

In most cases, a certain LMW compound selectively sensitize the skin, giving rise to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), or the respiratory tract, giving rise to occupational asthma (OA). To limit occurrence of allergic diseases, efforts are currently being made to develop predictive assays that accurately identify chemicals capable of inducing such reactions. However, while a few promising methods for prediction of skin sensitization have been described, to date no validated method, in vitro or in vivo, exists that is able to accurately classify chemicals as respiratory sensitizers. Results Recently, we presented the in vitro based Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD) assay as a novel testing strategy for classification of skin sensitizing chemicals based on measurement of a genomic biomarker signature. We have expanded the applicability domain of the GARD assay to classify also respiratory sensitizers by identifying a separate biomarker signature containing 389 differentially regulated genes for respiratory sensitizers in comparison to non-respiratory sensitizers. By using an independent data set in combination with supervised machine learning, we validated the assay, showing that the identified genomic biomarker is able to accurately classify respiratory sensitizers. Conclusions We have identified a genomic biomarker signature for classification of respiratory sensitizers. Combining this newly identified biomarker signature with our previously identified biomarker signature for classification of skin sensitizers, we have developed a novel in vitro testing strategy with a potent ability to predict both skin and respiratory sensitization in the same sample.

The study area was the Huaibei Plain in eastern China, and all models were calibrated and validated for five separate prefectures. To this end, a cross-validation process was developed that integrates model meta-parameterization and simple forward feature selection. We found that the resulting models deliver early estimates that are accurate enough to support decision making in the agricultural sector and to allow their operational use for yield forecasting. To attain maximum prediction accuracy, incorporating predictors from the end of the growing season is, however, recommended.

Multivariate classification with random forests for gravitational wave searches of black hole binary coalescence	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DISCOVERY	Searches for gravitational waves produced by coalescing black hole binaries with total masses. 25 M-circle dot use matched filtering with templates of short duration. Non-Gaussian noise bursts in gravitational wave detector data can mimic short signals and limit the sensitivity of these searches. Previous searches have relied on empirically designed statistics incorporating signal-to-noise ratio and signal-based vetoes to separate gravitational wave candidates from noise candidates. We report on sensitivity improvements achieved using a multivariate candidate ranking statistic derived from a supervised machine learning algorithm. We apply the random forest of bagged decision trees technique to two separate searches in the high mass (greater than or similar to 25 M-circle dot) parameter space. For a search which is sensitive to gravitational waves from the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of binary black holes with total mass between 25 M-circle dot and 100 M-circle dot, we find sensitive volume improvements as high as 70(+/- 13)%-109(+/- 11)% when compared to the previously used ranking statistic. For a ringdown-only search which is sensitive to gravitational waves from the resultant perturbed intermediate mass black hole with mass roughly between 10 M-circle dot and 600 M-circle dot, we find sensitive volume improvements as high as 61(+/- 4)%-241(+/- 12)% when compared to the previously used ranking statistic. We also report how sensitivity improvements can differ depending on mass regime, mass ratio, and available data quality information. Finally, we describe the techniques used to tune and train the random forest classifier that can be generalized to its use in other searches for gravitational waves.

Machine learning of single molecule free energy surfaces and the impact of chemistry and environment upon structure and dynamics	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; HYDROPHOBIC FREE-ENERGY; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; N-ALKANE CHAINS; DIFFUSION MAPS; PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; HYDROCARBON CHAINS; WATER; PROTEINS; SYSTEMS	The conformational states explored by polymers and proteins can be controlled by environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and solvent) and molecular chemistry (e.g., molecular weight and side chain identity). We introduce an approach employing the diffusion map nonlinear machine learning technique to recover single molecule free energy landscapes from molecular simulations, quantify changes to the landscape as a function of external conditions and molecular chemistry, and relate these changes to modifications of molecular structure and dynamics. In an application to an n-eicosane chain, we quantify the thermally accessible chain configurations as a function of temperature and solvent conditions. In an application to a family of polyglutamate-derivative homopeptides, we quantify helical stability as a function of side chain length, resolve the critical side chain length for the helix-coil transition, and expose the molecular mechanisms underpinning side chain-mediated helix stability. By quantifying single molecule responses through perturbations to the underlying free energy surface, our approach provides a quantitative bridge between experimentally controllable variables and microscopic molecular behavior, guiding and informing rational engineering of desirable molecular structure and function.

Spectral neighbor analysis method for automated generation of quantum-accurate interatomic potentials	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Interatomic potential; Machine learning; Spectral neighbor analysis potential; SNAP; Gaussian approximation potentials; Molecular dynamics	TANTALUM; MOLYBDENUM; TUNGSTEN	We present a new interatomic potential for solids and liquids called Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP). The SNAP potential has a very general form and uses machine-learning techniques to reproduce the energies, forces, and stress tensors of a large set of small configurations of atoms, which are obtained using high-accuracy quantum electronic structure (QM) calculations. The local environment of each atom is characterized by a set of bispectrum components of the local neighbor density projected onto a basis of hyperspherical harmonics in four dimensions. The bispectrum components are the same bond-orientational order parameters employed by the GAP potential[1]. The SNAP potential, unlike GAP, assumes a linear relationship between atom energy and bispectrum components. The linear SNAP coefficients are determined using weighted least-squares linear regression against the full QM training set. This allows the SNAP potential to be fit in a robust, automated manner to large QM data sets using many bispectrum components. The calculation of the bispectrum components and the SNAP potential are implemented in the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics code. We demonstrate that a previously unnoticed symmetry property can be exploited to reduce the computational cost of the force calculations by more than one order of magnitude. We present results for a SNAP potential for tantalum, showing that it accurately reproduces a range of commonly calculated properties of both the crystalline solid and the liquid phases. In addition, unlike simpler existing potentials, SNAP correctly predicts the energy barrier for screw dislocation migration in BCC tantalum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Thompson, A.

J	Ponce, H; Ponce, P; Molina, A				Ponce, Hiram; Ponce, Pedro; Molina, Arturo			The Development of an Artificial Organic Networks Toolkit for LabVIEW	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						artificial hydrocarbon networks; software implementation; sensor characterization; blood-brain barrier partitioning; machine learning	HYDROCARBON NETWORKS; ADME EVALUATION; DRUG DISCOVERY; PREDICTION; SURFACE; SET	Two of the most challenging problems that scientists and researchers face when they want to experiment with new cutting-edge algorithms are the time-consuming for encoding and the difficulties for linking them with other technologies and devices. In that sense, this article introduces the artificial organic networks toolkit for LabVIEW (AON-TL) from the implementation point of view. The toolkit is based on the framework provided by the artificial organic networks technique, giving it the potential to add new algorithms in the future based on this technique. Moreover, the toolkit inherits both the rapid prototyping and the easy-to-use characteristics of the LabVIEW software (e.g., graphical programming, transparent usage of other softwares and devices, built-in programming event-driven for user interfaces), to make it simple for the end-user. In fact, the article describes the global architecture of the toolkit, with particular emphasis in the software implementation of the so-called artificial hydrocarbon networks algorithm. Lastly, the article includes two case studies for engineering purposes (i.e., sensor characterization) and chemistry applications (i.e., blood-brain barrier partitioning data model) to show the usage of the toolkit and the potential scalability of the artificial organic networks technique.

Predicting fecal sources in waters with diverse pollution loads using general and molecular host-specific indicators and applying machine learning methods	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fecal pollution; Bacteria; Bacteriophages; Bifidobacterium; Bacteroides; Machine learning; Microbial source tracking	MICROBIAL SOURCE TRACKING; CONTAMINATED SURFACE-WATER; SOMATIC COLIPHAGES; CULTURE TECHNIQUES; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; IDENTIFY SOURCES; IDENTIFICATION; PERSISTENCE; PCR; POPULATIONS	In this study we use a machine learning software (Ichnaea) to generate predictive models for water samples with different concentrations of fecal contamination (point source, moderate and low). We applied several MST methods (host-specific Bacteroides phages, mitochondrial DNA genetic markers, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium dentium markers, and bifidobacterial host-specific qPCR), and general indicators (Escherichia colt, enterococci and somatic coliphages) to evaluate the source of contamination in the samples. The results provided data to the Ichnaea software, that evaluated the performance of each method in the different scenarios and determined the source of the contamination. Almost all MST methods in this study determined correctly the origin of fecal contamination at point source and in moderate concentration samples. When the dilution of the fecal pollution increased (below 3 log(10) CPU E. coli/100 ml) some of these indicators (bifidobacterial host-specific qPCR, some mitochondrial markers or B. dentium marker) were not suitable because their concentrations decreased below the detection limit. Using the data from source point samples, the software Ichnaea produced models for waters with low levels of fecal pollution. These models included some MST methods, on the basis of their best performance, that were used to determine the source of pollution in this area. Regardless the methods selected, that could vary depending on the scenario, inductive machine learning methods are a promising tool in MST studies and may represent a leap forward in solving MST cases.

Integrated satellite data fusion and mining for monitoring lake water quality status of the Albufera de Valencia in Spain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Lake management; Remote sensing; Data fusion; Data mining; Machine learning	LANDSAT SURFACE REFLECTANCE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; IMAGERY; MODEL; ALGORITHMS	Lake eutrophication is a critical issue in the interplay of water supply, environmental management, and ecosystem conservation. Integrated sensing, monitoring, and modeling for a holistic lake water quality assessment with respect to multiple constituents is in acute need. The aim of this paper is to develop an integrated algorithm for data fusion and mining of satellite remote sensing images to generate daily estimates of some water quality parameters of interest, such as chlorophyll a concentrations and water transparency, to be applied for the assessment of the hypertrophic Albufera de Valencia. The Albufera de Valencia is the largest freshwater lake in Spain, which can often present values of chlorophyll a concentration over 200 mg m(-3) and values of transparency (Secchi Disk, SD) as low as 20 cm. Remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhance Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images were fused to carry out an integrative near-real time water quality assessment on a daily basis. Landsat images are useful to study the spatial variability of the water quality parameters, due to its spatial resolution of 30 m, in comparison to the low spatial resolution (250/500 m) of MODIS. While Landsat offers a high spatial resolution, the low temporal resolution of 16 days is a significant drawback to achieve a near real-time monitoring system. This gap may be bridged by using MODIS images that have a high temporal resolution of 1 day, in spite of its low spatial resolution. Synthetic Landsat images were fused for dates with no Landsat overpass over the study area. Finally, with a suite of ground truth data, a few genetic programming (GP) models were derived to estimate the water quality using the fused surface reflectance data as inputs. The GP model for chlorophyll a estimation yielded a R-2 of 0.94, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 8 mg m(-3), and the GP model for water transparency estimation using Secchi disk showed a R-2 of 0.89, with an RMSE = 4 cm. With this effort, the spatiotemporal variations of water transparency and chlorophyll a concentrations may be assessed simultaneously on a daily basis throughout the lake for environmental management.

In recent years, many software solutions capable of automatically identifying activity types from portable accelerometry data have been developed, with promising results in controlled conditions, but virtually no reports on field tests. An automatic classification algorithm initially developed using laboratory-acquired data (59 subjects engaging in a set of 24 standardized activities) to discriminate between 8 activity classes (lying, slouching, sitting, standing, walking, running, and cycling) was applied to data collected in the field. Twenty volunteers equipped with a hip-worn triaxial accelerometer performed at their own pace an activity set that included, among others, activities such as walking the streets, running, cycling, and taking the bus. Performances of the laboratory-calibrated classification algorithm were compared with those of an alternative version of the same model including field-collected data in the learning set. Despite good results in laboratory conditions, the performances of the laboratory-calibrated algorithm (assessed by confusion matrices) decreased for several activities when applied to free-living data. Recalibrating the algorithm with data closer to real-life conditions and from an independent group of subjects proved useful, especially for the detection of sedentary behaviors while in transports, thereby improving the detection of overall sitting (sensitivity: laboratory model = 24.9%; recalibrated model = 95.7%). Automatic identification methods should be developed using data acquired in free-living conditions rather than data from standardized laboratory activity sets only, and their limits carefully tested before they are used in field studies.

Hamid			Decomposition of surface EMG signals from cyclic dynamic contractions	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						dynamic contractions; gait; motor units; firing rate	HUMAN MOTOR UNITS; VOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; ELECTROMYOGRAM; RECRUITMENT; MUSCLES; THRESHOLD; BEHAVIOR	Over the past 3 decades, various algorithms used to decompose the electromyographic (EMG) signal into its constituent motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) have been reported. All are limited to decomposing EMG signals from isometric contraction. In this report, we describe a successful approach to decomposing the surface EMG (sEMG) signal collected from cyclic (repeated concentric and eccentric) dynamic contractions during flexion/extension of the elbow and during gait. The increased signal complexity introduced by the changing shapes of the MUAPs due to relative movement of the electrodes and the lengthening/shortening of muscle fibers was managed by an incremental approach to enhancing our established algorithm for decomposing sEMG signals obtained from isometric contractions. We used machine-learning algorithms and time-varying MUAP shape discrimination to decompose the sEMG signal from an increasingly challenging sequence of pseudostatic and dynamic contractions. The accuracy of the decomposition results was assessed by two verification methods that have been independently evaluated. The firing instances of the motor units had an accuracy of similar to 90% with a MUAP train yield as high as 25. Preliminary observations from the performance of motor units during cyclic contractions indicate that during repetitive dynamic contractions, the control of motor units is governed by the same rules as those evidenced during isometric contractions. Modifications in the control properties of motoneuron firings reported by previous studies were not confirmed. Instead, our data demonstrate that the common drive and hierarchical recruitment of motor units are preserved during concentric and eccentric contractions.

Here, the focus is on identifying the functional capable of obtaining the best theoretical approximation to experimentally observed maximum absorption wavelength lambda(max) for a series of azobenzene and anthraquinone dyes.

MRDB are mainly obtained through model and cartographic generalizations. The model generalization is essentially achieved with the selection/elimination process in which a decision must be made to include or exclude the object at the target level. In this study, support vector machines (SVM) was, for the first time, used for the selection/elimination process in stream network generalization. Within this context, the attributes to be used as input data in the SVM method were determined and weighted according to the associations determined in a chi-squared independence test. 1:100,000-scale (medium resolution) stream networks were derived from two 1:24,000-scale (high resolution) stream networks with different patterns in the United States Geological Survey National Hydrography Data-sets. The derived stream networks were quite similar to the 1:100,000-scale original stream networks in both qualitative and visual aspects.

J	Wei, CC				Wei, Chih-Chiang			Forecasting surface wind speeds over offshore islands near Taiwan during tropical cyclones: Comparisons of data-driven algorithms and parametric wind representations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						wind speed; tropical cyclone; prediction; model	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; UNITED-STATES; HURRICANE; MODEL; SIMULATION; PREDICTION; PROFILES; MACHINES; NETWORKS	Tropical cyclones often affect the western North Pacific region. Between May and October annually, enormous flood damage is frequently caused by typhoons in Taiwan. This study adopted machine learning techniques to forecast the hourly wind speeds over offshore islands near Taiwan during tropical cyclones. To develop a highly reliable surface wind speed prediction technique, the four kernel-based support vector machines for regression (SVR) models, comprising radial basis function, linear, polynomial, and Pearson VII universal kernels were used. To ensure the accuracy of the SVR model, traditional regressions and the parametric wind representations, comprising the modified Rankine profile, Holland wind profile, and DeMaria wind profile were used to compare wind speed forecasts. The methodology was applied to two islands near Taiwan, Lanyu, and Pengjia Islets. The forecasting horizon ranged from 1 to 6h. The results indicated that the Pearson VII SVR is the most precise of the kernel-based SVR models, regressions, and parametric wind representations. Additionally, Typhoons Nanmadol and Saola which made landfall over Taiwan during 2011 and 2012 were simulated and examined. The results showed that the Pearson VII SVR yielded more favorable results than did the regressions and Holland wind profile. In addition, we observed that Holland wind profile seems applicable to open ocean but unsuitable for areas affected by topographic effects, such as the Central Mountain Range of Taiwan.

Locating landmarks on high-dimensional free energy surfaces	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						free energy surface; stochastic optimization; activation-relaxation; machine learning; network representation	FINDING SADDLE-POINTS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; COLLECTIVE VARIABLES; LANDSCAPES; RELAXATION; REDUCTION; PATHS	Coarse graining of complex systems possessing many degrees of freedom can often be a useful approach for analyzing and understanding key features of these systems in terms of just a few variables. The relevant energy landscape in a coarse-grained description is the free energy surface as a function of the coarse-grained variables, which, despite the dimensional reduction, can still be an object of high dimension. Consequently, navigating and exploring this high-dimensional free energy surface is a nontrivial task. In this paper, we use techniques from multiscale modeling, stochastic optimization, and machine learning to devise a strategy for locating minima and saddle points (termed "landmarks") on a high-dimensional free energy surface "on the fly" and without requiring prior knowledge of or an explicit form for the surface. In addition, we propose a compact graph representation of the landmarks and connections between them, and we show that the graph nodes can be subsequently analyzed and clustered based on key attributes that elucidate important properties of the system. Finally, we show that knowledge of landmark locations allows for the efficient determination of their relative free energies via enhanced sampling techniques.

While large North American research networks have derived clinical prediction rules for the head injured child, these may not be generalizable to practices in countries with traditionally low rates of computed tomography (CT). We aim to study predictors for moderate to severe TBI in our ED population aged < 16 years. Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study based on data from a prospective surveillance head injury database. Cases were included if patients presented from 2006 to 2014, with moderate to severe TBI. Controls were age-matched head injured children from the registry, obtained in a 4 control: 1 case ratio. These children remained well on diagnosis and follow up. Demographics, history, and physical examination findings were analyzed and patients followed up for the clinical course and outcome measures of death and neurosurgical intervention. To predict moderate to severe TBI, we built a machine learning (ML) model and a multivariable logistic regression model and compared their performances by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: There were 39 cases and 156 age-matched controls. The following 4 predictors remained statistically significant after multivariable analysis: Involvement in road traffic accident, a history of loss of consciousness, vomiting and signs of base of skull fracture. The logistic regression model was created with these 4 variables while the ML model was built with 3 extra variables, namely the presence of seizure, confusion and clinical signs of skull fracture. At the optimal cutoff scores, the ML method improved upon the logistic regression method with respect to the area under the ROC curve (0.98 vs 0.93), sensitivity (94.9% vs 82.1%), specificity (97.4% vs 92.3%), PPV (90.2% vs 72.7%), and NPV (98.7% vs 95.4%). Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning as a tool to predict moderate to severe TBI. If validated on a large scale, the ML method has the potential not only to guide discretionary use of CT, but also a more careful selection of head injured children who warrant closer monitoring in the hospital.

Spatiotemporal Prediction of Fine Particulate Matter During the 2008 Northern California Wildfires Using Machine Learning	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH; LAND-USE REGRESSION; FIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION EVENTS; GROUND-LEVEL PM2.5; FOREST-FIRES; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; HEALTH OUTCOMES; TIME-SERIES; AUSTRALIA	Estimating population exposure to particulate matter during wildfires can be difficult because of insufficient monitoring data to capture the spatiotemporal variability of smoke plumes. Chemical transport models (CTMs) and satellite retrievals provide spatiotemporal data that may be useful in predicting PM2.5 during wildfires. We estimated PM2.5 concentrations during the 2008 northern California wildfires using 10-fold cross-validation (CV) to select an optimal prediction model from a set of 11 statistical algorithms and 29 predictor variables. The variables included CTM output, three measures of satellite aerosol optical depth, distance to the nearest fires, meteorological data, and land use, traffic, spatial location, and temporal characteristics. The generalized boosting model (GBM) with 29 predictor variables had the lowest CV root mean squared error and a CV-R-2 of 0.803. The most important predictor variable was the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Aerosol/Smoke Product (GASP) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), followed by the CTM output and distance to the nearest fire cluster. Parsimonious models with various combinations of fewer variables also predicted PM2.5 well. Using machine learning algorithms to combine spatiotemp oral data from satellites and CTMs can reliably predict PM2.5 concentrations during a major wildfire event.

Using epigenomics data to predict gene expression in lung cancer	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA) - Bioinformatics	JUN 28-30, 2014	Zhangjiajie, PEOPLES R CHINA				WIDE DNA METHYLATION; GENOME; VERTEBRATE; ELEMENTS; ISLANDS; MECP2	Background: Epigenetic alterations are known to correlate with changes in gene expression among various diseases including cancers. However, quantitative models that accurately predict the up or down regulation of gene expression are currently lacking. Methods: A new machine learning-based method of gene expression prediction is developed in the context of lung cancer. This method uses the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip CpG methylation array data from paired lung cancer and adjacent normal tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and histone modification marker CHIP-Seq data from the ENCODE project, to predict the differential expression of RNA-Seq data in TCGA lung cancers. It considers a comprehensive list of 1424 features spanning the four categories of CpG methylation, histone H3 methylation modification, nucleotide composition, and conservation. Various feature selection and classification methods are compared to select the best model over 10-fold cross-validation in the training data set. Results: A best model comprising 67 features is chosen by ReliefF based feature selection and random forest classification method, with AUC = 0.864 from the 10-fold cross-validation of the training set and AUC = 0.836 from the testing set. The selected features cover all four data types, with histone H3 methylation modification (32 features) and CpG methylation (15 features) being most abundant. Among the dropping-off tests of individual data-type based features, removal of CpG methylation feature leads to the most reduction in model performance. In the best model, 19 selected features are from the promoter regions (TSS200 and TSS1500), highest among all locations relative to transcripts. Sequential dropping-off of CpG methylation features relative to different regions on the protein coding transcripts shows that promoter regions contribute most significantly to the accurate prediction of gene expression. Conclusions: By considering a comprehensive list of epigenomic and genomic features, we have constructed an accurate model to predict transcriptomic differential expression, exemplified in lung cancer.

One key challenge is to detect functional driver pathways and to filter out nonfunctional passenger genes in cancer genomics. Vandin et al. introduced the Maximum Weight Sub-matrix Problem to find driver pathways and showed that it is an NP-hard problem. Methods: To find a better solution and solve the problem more efficiently, we present a network-based method (NBM) to detect overlapping driver pathways automatically. This algorithm can directly find driver pathways or gene sets de novo from somatic mutation data utilizing two combinatorial properties, high coverage and high exclusivity, without any prior information. We firstly construct gene networks based on the approximate exclusivity between each pair of genes using somatic mutation data from many cancer patients. Secondly, we present a new greedy strategy to add or remove genes for obtaining overlapping gene sets with driver mutations according to the properties of high exclusivity and high coverage. Results: To assess the efficiency of the proposed NBM, we apply the method on simulated data and compare results obtained from the NBM, RME, Dendrix and Multi-Dendrix. NBM obtains optimal results in less than nine seconds on a conventional computer and the time complexity is much less than the three other methods. To further verify the performance of NBM, we apply the method to analyze somatic mutation data from five real biological data sets such as the mutation profiles of 90 glioblastoma tumor samples and 163 lung carcinoma samples. NBM detects groups of genes which overlap with known pathways, including P53, RB and RTK/RAS/PI(3) K signaling pathways. New gene sets with p-value less than 1e-3 are found from the somatic mutation data. Conclusions: NBM can detect more biologically relevant gene sets. Results show that NBM outperforms other algorithms for detecting driver pathways or gene sets. Further research will be conducted with the use of novel machine learning techniques.

J	Xu, R; Wang, QQ				Xu, Rong; Wang, QuanQiu			Comparing a knowledge-driven approach to a supervised machine learning approach in large-scale extraction of drug-side effect relationships from free-text biomedical literature	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA) - Bioinformatics	JUN 28-30, 2014	Zhangjiajie, PEOPLES R CHINA				PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; DISEASE; PAIRS	Background: Systems approaches to studying drug-side-effect (drug-SE) associations are emerging as an active research area for both drug target discovery and drug repositioning. However, a comprehensive drug-SE association knowledge base does not exist. In this study, we present a novel knowledge-driven (KD) approach to effectively extract a large number of drug-SE pairs from published biomedical literature. Data and methods: For the text corpus, we used 21,354,075 MEDLINE records (119,085,682 sentences). First, we used known drug-SE associations derived from FDA drug labels as prior knowledge to automatically find SE-related sentences and abstracts. We then extracted a total of 49,575 drug-SE pairs from MEDLINE sentences and 180,454 pairs from abstracts. Results: On average, the KD approach has achieved a precision of 0.335, a recall of 0.509, and an F1 of 0.392, which is significantly better than a SVM-based machine learning approach (precision: 0.135, recall: 0.900, F1: 0.233) with a 73.0% increase in F1 score. Through integrative analysis, we demonstrate that the higher-level phenotypic drug-SE relationships reflects lower-level genetic, genomic, and chemical drug mechanisms. In addition, we show that the extracted drug-SE pairs can be directly used in drug repositioning. Conclusion: In summary, we automatically constructed a large-scale higher-level drug phenotype relationship knowledge, which can have great potential in computational drug discovery.

Entanglement-Based Machine Learning on a Quantum Computer	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							SIMULATIONS; ALGORITHMS; PROCESSOR; SYSTEMS; PHOTON	Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, learns from previous experience to optimize performance, which is ubiquitous in various fields such as computer sciences, financial analysis, robotics, and bioinformatics. A challenge is that machine learning with the rapidly growing "big data" could become intractable for classical computers. Recently, quantum machine learning algorithms [Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost, arXiv. 1307.0411] were proposed which could offer an exponential speedup over classical algorithms. Here, we report the first experimental entanglement-based classification of two-, four-, and eight-dimensional vectors to different clusters using a small-scale photonic quantum computer, which are then used to implement supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The results demonstrate the working principle of using quantum computers to manipulate and classify high-dimensional vectors, the core mathematical routine in machine learning. The method can, in principle, be scaled to larger numbers of qubits, and may provide a new route to accelerate machine learning.

J	Groza, T; Verspoor, K				Groza, Tudor; Verspoor, Karin			Assessing the Impact of Case Sensitivity and Term Information Gain on Biomedical Concept Recognition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WEB SERVICES; TEXT; ONTOLOGIES; ANNOTATION; KNOWLEDGE; PROTEIN; SYSTEM	Concept recognition (CR) is a foundational task in the biomedical domain. It supports the important process of transforming unstructured resources into structured knowledge. To date, several CR approaches have been proposed, most of which focus on a particular set of biomedical ontologies. Their underlying mechanisms vary from shallow natural language processing and dictionary lookup to specialized machine learning modules. However, no prior approach considers the case sensitivity characteristics and the term distribution of the underlying ontology on the CR process. This article proposes a framework that models the CR process as an information retrieval task in which both case sensitivity and the information gain associated with tokens in lexical representations (e.g., term labels, synonyms) are central components of a strategy for generating term variants. The case sensitivity of a given ontology is assessed based on the distribution of so-called case sensitive tokens in its terms, while information gain is modelled using a combination of divergence from randomness and mutual information. An extensive evaluation has been carried out using the CRAFT corpus. Experimental results show that case sensitivity awareness leads to an increase of up to 0.07 F1 against a non-case sensitive baseline on the Protein Ontology and GO Cellular Component. Similarly, the use of information gain leads to an increase of up to 0.06 F1 against a standard baseline in the case of GO Biological Process and Molecular Function and GO Cellular Component. Overall, subject to the underlying token distribution, these methods lead to valid complementary strategies for augmenting term label sets to improve concept recognition.

Conventional descriptions of motor control and learning rely on dynamical representations of our body's state (forward and inverse models), and control policies that must be integrated forward to generate feedforward time-varying commands; thus these are representations across space, but not time. Here we examine a new approach that directly represents both time-varying commands and the resulting state trajectories with a function; a representation across space and time. Since the output of this function includes time, it necessarily requires more parameters than atypical dynamical model. To avoid the problems of local minima these extra parameters introduce, we exploit recent advances in machine learning to build our function using a stacked autoencoder, or deep network. With initial and target states as inputs, this deep network can be trained to output an accurate temporal profile of the optimal command and state trajectory for a point-to-point reach of a non-linear limb model, even when influenced by varying force fields. In a manner that mirrors motor babble, the network can also teach itself to learn through trial and error. Lastly, we demonstrate how this network can learn to optimize a cost objective. This functional approach to motor control is a sharp departure from the standard dynamical approach, and may offer new insights into the neural implementation of motor control.

A usual alternative is the multivariate histogram, which features a low computational complexity. Multivariate frequency polygons have often been neglected, even though they share many of the advantages of the histograms, while they are continuous unlike the histograms. Here we build on our previous work on histograms in order to propose a new probability density estimator which is based on averaging multivariate frequency polygons. The convergence of the estimator is formally proved. Experiments are carried out with synthetic and real machine learning datasets. Finally, image denoising and object tracking applications are also considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As linear classifiers, they play an important role in the foundations of machine learning. In the context of the emerging field of quantum machine learning, several attempts have been made to develop a corresponding unit using quantum information theory. Based on the quantum phase estimation algorithm, this paper introduces a quantum perceptron model imitating the step-activation function of a classical perceptron. This scheme requires resources in O(n) (where n is the size of the input) and promises efficient applications for more complex structures such as trainable quantum neural networks.

The width of the Gaussian distribution, the variability of a spatial restraint, is closely related to the reliability of the restraint information extracted from a template, and it should be accurately estimated for successful template-based protein structure modeling. Results: To predict the variability of the spatial restraints in template-based modeling, we have devised a prediction model, Sigma-RF, by using the random forest (RF) algorithm. The benchmark results on 22 CASP9 targets show that the variability values from Sigma-RF are of higher correlations with the true distance deviation than those from Modeller. We assessed the effect of new sigma values by performing the single-domain homology modeling of 22 CASP9 targets and 24 CASP10 targets. For most of the targets tested, we could obtain more accurate 3D models from the identical alignments by using the Sigma-RF results than by using Modeller ones. Conclusions: We find that the average alignment quality of residues located between and at two aligned residues, quasi-local information, is the most contributing factor, by investigating the importance of input features used in the RF machine learning. This average alignment quality is shown to be more important than the previously identified quantity of a local information: the product of alignment qualities at two aligned residues.

Because several novel approaches performing better than the common BLAST tool are rarely applied in research, we hypothesized that there is a large gap between the number of known annotated enzymes and the actual number in the protein universe, which significantly limits our ability to extract additional biologically relevant functional information from the available sequencing data. To reliably expand the enzyme space, we developed DomSign, a highly accurate domain signature-based enzyme functional prediction tool to assign Enzyme Commission (EC) digits. Results: DomSign is a top-down prediction engine that yields results comparable, or superior, to those from many benchmark EC number prediction tools, including BLASTP, when a homolog with an identity >30% is not available in the database. Performance tests showed that DomSign is a highly reliable enzyme EC number annotation tool. After multiple tests, the accuracy is thought to be greater than 90%. Thus, DomSign can be applied to large-scale datasets, with the goal of expanding the enzyme space with high fidelity. Using DomSign, we successfully increased the percentage of EC-tagged enzymes from 12% to 30% in UniProt-TrEMBL. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes bacterial database, the percentage of EC-tagged enzymes for each bacterial genome could be increased from 26.0% to 33.2% on average. Metagenomic mining was also efficient, as exemplified by the application of DomSign to the Human Microbiome Project dataset, recovering nearly one million new EC-labeled enzymes. Conclusions: Our results offer preliminarily confirmation of the existence of the hypothesized huge number of "hidden enzymes" in the protein universe, the identification of which could substantially further our understanding of the metabolisms of diverse organisms and also facilitate bioengineering by providing a richer enzyme resource. Furthermore, our results highlight the necessity of using more advanced computational tools than BLAST in protein database annotations to extract additional biologically relevant functional information from the available biological sequences.

We propose that this trend be accompanied by a thorough examination of data sharing priorities. We argue that the most significant immediate benefactor of open data is in fact chemical algorithms, which are capable of absorbing vast quantities of data, and using it to present concise insights to working chemists, on a scale that could not be achieved by traditional publication methods. Making this goal practically achievable will require a paradigm shift in the way individual scientists translate their data into digital form, since most contemporary methods of data entry are designed for presentation to humans rather than consumption by machine learning algorithms. We discuss some of the complex issues involved in fixing current methods, as well as some of the immediate benefits that can be gained when open data is published correctly using unambiguous machine readable formats.

Promoters are the key regulatory elements, which recruit the transcriptional machinery through binding to a variety of regulatory proteins (known as sigma factors). The identification of the promoter regions is very challenging because these regions do not adhere to specific sequence patterns or motifs and are difficult to determine experimentally. Machine learning represents a promising and cost-effective approach for computational identification of prokaryotic promoter regions. However, the quality of the predictors depends on several factors including: i) training data; ii) data representation; iii) classification algorithms; iv) evaluation procedures. In this work, we create several variants of E. coli promoter data sets and utilize them to experimentally examine the effect of these factors on the predictive performance of E. coli sigma(70) promoter models. Our results suggest that under some combinations of the first three criteria, a prediction model might perform very well on cross-validation experiments while its performance on independent test data is drastically very poor. This emphasizes the importance of evaluating promoter region predictors using independent test data, which corrects for the over-optimistic performance that might be estimated using the cross-validation procedure. Our analysis of the tested models shows that good prediction models often perform well despite how the non-promoter data was obtained. On the other hand, poor prediction models seems to be more sensitive to the choice of non-promoter sequences. Interestingly, the best performing sequence-based classifiers outperform the best performing structure-based classifiers on both cross-validation and independent test performance evaluation experiments. Finally, we propose a meta-predictor method combining two top performing sequence-based and structure-based classifiers and compare its performance with some of the state-of-the-art E. coli s70 promoter prediction methods.

The size of AMPs ranges from less than ten to hundreds of amino acids. Often only a few amino acids or the critical regions of antimicrobial proteins matter the functionality. Accurately predicting the AMP critical regions could benefit the experimental designs. However, no extensive analyses have been done specifically on the AMP critical regions and computational modeling on them is either non-existent or settled to other problems. With a focus on the AMP critical regions, we thus develop a computational model AMPcore by introducing a state-of-the-art machine learning method, conditional random fields. We generate a comprehensive dataset of 798 AMPs cores and a low similarity dataset of 510 representative AMP cores. AMPcore could reach a maximal accuracy of 90% and 0.79 Matthew's correlation coefficient on the comprehensive dataset and a maximal accuracy of 83% and 0.66 MCC on the low similarity dataset. Our analyses of AMP cores follow what we know about AMPs: High in glycine and lysine, but low in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and methionine; the abundance of a-helical structures; the dominance of positive net charges; the peculiarity of amphipathicity. Two amphipathic sequence motifs within the AMP cores, an amphipathic alpha-helix and an amphipathic p-helix, are revealed. In addition, a short sequence motif at the N-terminal boundary of AMP cores is reported for the first time: arginine at the P(-1) coupling with glycine at the P1 of AMP cores occurs the most, which might link to microbial cell adhesion.

The history allows a player to label opponents by their strategies, enabling a player to determine the population distribution and to act differentially based on the opponent's strategy in each pairwise interaction. For the Prisoner's Dilemma, these advantages lead to the natural formation of cooperative coalitions among similarly behaving players and eventually to unilateral defection against opposing player types. We show analytically and empirically that optimal play in population games depends strongly on the population distribution. For example, the optimal strategy for a minority player type against a resident TFT population is ALLC, while for a majority player type the optimal strategy versus TFT players is ALLD. Such behaviors are not accessible to memory-one strategies. Drawing inspiration from Sun Tzu's the Art of War, we implemented a non-memoryone strategy for population games based on techniques from machine learning and statistical inference that can exploit the history of play in this manner. Via simulation we find that this strategy is essentially uninvadable and can successfully invade (significantly more likely than a neutral mutant) essentially all known memory-one strategies for the Prisoner's Dilemma, including ALLC (always cooperate), ALLD (always defect), tit-for-tat (TFT), winstay- lose-shift (WSLS), and zero determinant (ZD) strategies, including extortionate and generous strategies.

We define a quantitative criterion of embedding quality assessment for nearest neighbor classification, and present a method called NNMap to construct a good embedding. Furthermore, an efficient distance is obtained in the embedded vector space, which could speed up nearest neighbor classification. The quantitative quality criterion is proposed as a local structure descriptor of sample data distribution. Embedding quality corresponds to the quality of the local structure. In the framework of NNMap, one-dimension embeddings act as weak classifiers with pseudo-losses defined on the amount of the local structure preserved by the embedding. Based on this property, the NNMap method reduces the problem of embedding construction to the classical boosting problem. An important property of NNMap is that the embedding optimization criterion is appropriate for both vector and non-vector data, and equally valid in both metric and non-metric spaces. The effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated by experiments conducted on the MNIST handwritten dataset, the CMU PIE face images dataset and the datasets from UCI machine learning repository.

The optimization is important but difficult for non-convex regularization. In this paper, we propose the Damping Proximal Coordinate Descent (DPCD) algorithms that address the optimization issues of a general family of non-convex regularized problems. DPCD is guaranteed to be globally convergent. The computational complexity of obtaining an approximately stationary solution with a desired precision is only linear to the data size. Our experiments on many machine learning benchmark datasets also show that DPCD has a fast convergence rate and it reduces the time of training models without significant loss of prediction accuracy.

However, conventional feature selection may work out in face of dynamic and complex traffic data. Multi-Task Learning has obtained quite wide attention nowadays, and one important form of multi-task learning is to exploit the features shared by tasks by sparse models. We propose a fast multi-task sparse feature learning method, using a non-convex Capped-l1,l1 as the regularizer to learn a set of shared features in traffic data. Specifically, the non-convex multi-task feature learning model can learn features belonging to each task as well as the common features shared among tasks. We use the iterative shrinkage and thresholding (IST) algorithm to solve the problem, which has a closed-form solution for one of the crucial steps in the whole iteration. Experiment on real traffic data captured from backbone network as well as synthetic data and other popular real-world data show the effectiveness the method, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

The part of the brain cortex that processes language abilities is one of the earliest parts to be affected by the disease. Therefore, detection of Alzheimer's disease using speech-based features is gaining increasing attention. Here, we investigated an extensive set of features based on speech prosody as well as linguistic features derived from transcriptions of Turkish conversations with subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease. Unlike most standardized tests that focus on memory recall or structured conversations, spontaneous unstructured conversations are conducted with the subjects in informal settings. Age-, education-, and gender-controlled experiments are performed to eliminate the effects of those three variables. Experimental results show that the proposed features extracted from the speech signal can be used to discriminate between the control group and the patients with Alzheimer's disease. Prosodic features performed significantly better than the linguistic features. Classification accuracy over 80% was obtained with three of the prosodic features, but experiments with feature fusion did not further improve the classification performance.

When a classifier algorithm is trained on data from one cognitive context, and tested on data from another, conclusions can be drawn about the role of a given brain region in representing information that abstracts across those cognitive contexts. We call this kind of analysis Multivariate Cross-Classification (MVCC), and review several domains where it has recently made an impact. MVCC has been important in establishing correspondences among neural patterns across cognitive domains, including motor perception matching and cross sensory matching. It has been used to test for similarity between neural patterns evoked by perception and those generated from memory. Other work has used MVCC to investigate the similarity of representations for semantic categories across different kinds of stimulus presentation, and in the presence of different cognitive demands. We use these examples to demonstrate the power of MVCC as a tool for investigating neural abstraction and discuss some important methodological issues related to its application.

J	Spuler, M; Niethammer, C				Spueler, Martin; Niethammer, Christian			Error-related potentials during continuous feedback: using EEG to detect errors of different type and severity	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						error-related potential (ErrP); error-related negativity (Ne/ERN); feedback related negativity (FRN); brain-computer interface (BCI); human-computer interaction; performance monitoring; asynchronous classification	ERP COMPONENTS; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; INTERFACES; SPECTRA	When a person recognizes an error during a task, an error-related potential (ErrP) can be measured as response. It has been shown that ErrPs can be automatically detected in tasks with time discrete feedback, which is widely applied in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for error correction or adaptation. However, there are only a few studies that concentrate on ErrPs during continuous feedback. With this study, we wanted to answer three different questions: (i) Can ErrPs be measured in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during a task with continuous cursor control? (ii) Can ErrPs be classified using machine learning methods and is it possible to discriminate errors of different origins? (iii) Can we use EEG to detect the severity of an error? To answer these questions, we recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during a video game task and investigated two different types of error (execution error, due to inaccurate feedback; outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of an action). We analyzed the recorded data to show that during the same task, different kinds of error produce different ErrP waveforms and have a different spectral response. This allows us to detect and discriminate errors of different origin in an event-locked manner. By utilizing the error-related spectral response, we show that also a continuous, asynchronous detection of errors is possible. Although the detection of error severity based on EEG was one goal of this study, we did not find any significant influence of the severity on the EEG.

We mined the human proteome to discover properties of proteins that may be important in determining their suitability for pharmaceutical modulation. Data was gathered concerning each protein's sequence, post-translational modifications, secondary structure, germline variants, expression profile and drug target status. The data was then analysed to determine features for which the target and non-target proteins had significantly different values. This analysis was repeated for subsets of the proteome consisting of all G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, kinases and proteases, as well as proteins that are implicated in cancer. Machine learning was used to quantify the proteins in each dataset in terms of their potential to serve as a drug target. This was accomplished by first inducing a random forest that could distinguish between its targets and non-targets, and then using the random forest to quantify the drug target likeness of the non-targets. The properties that can best differentiate targets from non-targets were primarily those that are directly related to a protein's sequence (e.g. secondary structure). Germline variants, expression levels and interactions between proteins had minimal discriminative power. Overall, the best indicators of drug target likeness were found to be the proteins' hydrophobicities, in vivo half-lives, propensity for being membrane bound and the fraction of non-polar amino acids in their sequences. In terms of predicting potential targets, datasets of proteases, ion channels and cancer proteins were able to induce random forests that were highly capable of distinguishing between targets and non-targets. The non-target proteins predicted to be targets by these random forests comprise the set of the most suitable potential future drug targets, and should therefore be prioritised when building a drug development programme.

Case Study of Novel Arylpiperazines Derivatives	PLOS ONE			English	Article							5-HT1A RECEPTOR LIGANDS; METABOLISM; DESIGN; SITES	Other than efficacy of interaction with the molecular target, metabolic stability is the primary factor responsible for the failure or success of a compound in the drug development pipeline. The ideal drug candidate should be stable enough to reach its therapeutic site of action. Despite many recent excellent achievements in the field of computational methods supporting drug metabolism studies, a well-recognized procedure to model and predict metabolic stability quantitatively is still lacking. This study proposes a workflow for developing quantitative metabolic stability-structure relationships, taking a set of 30 arylpiperazine derivatives as an example. The metabolic stability of the compounds was assessed in in vitro incubations in the presence of human liver microsomes and NADPH and subsequently quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to obtain 30 models of the molecules, and Dragon software served as a source of structure-based molecular descriptors. For modeling structure-metabolic stability relationships, Support Vector Machines (SVM), a non-linear machine learning technique, were found to be more effective than a regression technique, based on the validation parameters obtained. Moreover, for the first time, general sites of metabolism for arylpiperazines bearing the 4-aryl-2H-pyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine-1,3-dione system were defined by analysis of Q-TOF-MS/MS spectra. The results indicated that the application of one of the most advanced chemometric techniques combined with a simple and quick in vitro procedure and LC-MS analysis provides a novel and valuable tool for predicting metabolic half-life values. Given the reduced time and simplicity of analysis, together with the accuracy of the predictions obtained, this is a valid approach for predicting metabolic stability using structural data. The approach presented provides a novel, comprehensive and reliable tool for investigating metabolic stability, factors that affect it, and the proposed structures of metabolites at the same time. The performance of the DFT-SVM-based approach provides an opportunity to implement it in a standard drug development pipeline.

State-of-the art approaches are either based on direct modeling and matching of the human appearance or on machine learning-based techniques. In this work we introduce a novel approach that studies densely localized image dissimilarities in a low dimensional space and uses those to re-identify between persons in a supervised classification framework. To achieve the goal: i) we compute the localized image dissimilarity between a pair of images; ii) we learn the lower dimensional space of such localized image dissimilarities, known as the "local eigen-dissimilarities" (LEDs) space; iii) we train a binary classifier to discriminate between LEDs computed for a positive pair (images are for a same person) from the ones computed for a negative pair (images are for different persons). We show the competitive performance of our approach on two publicly available benchmark datasets.

Although numerous studies have successfully demonstrated the use of high-throughput molecular diagnostics in cancer prediction, the application of microarrays in routine clinical use remains limited. Our aim was, therefore, to identify a small subset of genes to develop a practical and inexpensive diagnostic tool for clinical use. We developed a two-step feature selection method composed of a linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) linear model and an iterative Bayesian model averaging model to identify a suitable gene set signature. Using one public dataset for training, we discovered a three-gene signature dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), secretogranin V (SCG5) and carbonic anhydrase XII (CA12). We then evaluated the robustness of our gene set using three other independent public datasets. The gene signature accuracy was 85.7, 78.8 and 85.7%, respectively. For experimental validation, we collected 70 thyroid samples from surgery and our three-gene signature method achieved an accuracy of 94.3% by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) experiment. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry in 29 samples showed proteins expressed by these three genes are also differentially expressed in thyroid samples. Our protocol discovered a robust three-gene signature that can distinguish benign from malignant thyroid tumors, which will have daily clinical application.

This shift increased the probability that a fault occurring in an application propagates to others with the risk of a failure of the entire safety-critical system. This calls for new tools for the on-line detection of anomalous behaviors of the system, predicting thus a system failure before it happens, allowing the deployment of appropriate mitigation policies. The paper proposes a novel architecture, namely CASPER, for online failure prediction that has the distinctive features to be (i) black-box: no knowledge of applications internals and logic of the system is required (ii) non-intrusive: no status information of the components is used such as CPU or memory usage; The architecture has been implemented to predict failures in a real Air Traffic Control System. CASPER exhibits high degree of accuracy in predicting failures with low false positive rate. The experimental validation shows how operators are provided with predictions issued a few hundred of seconds before the occurrence of the failure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, P; Zhang, XD; Huang, H				Wang, Ping; Zhang, Xiaodan; Huang, Hua			Fast Inter Mode Decision Algorithm Based on Mode Mapping and Decision Tree for P Frames in MPEG-2 to H.264/AVC Transcoding	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Transcoding; MPEG-2; H.264/AVC; Mode decision; Mode mapping; Decision tree		There is an inevitable requirement of transcoding from MPEG-2 to H.264/AVC in many video applications. Due to the use of variable block sizes and rate-distortion optimization techniques in H.264, there is extremely high computational complexity in the reference cascaded transcoder. To reduce the complexity, this paper presents a fast inter mode decision algorithm for P frames in MPEG-2 to H.264/AVC transcoding. Firstly, with the statistical analysis of the correlation between the MB's coding mode in MPEG-2 and the corresponding mode in H.264/AVC, the proposed algorithm directly determines the candidate modes for some special MBs based on the mode mapping rules. Then for other MBs, machine learning tools are used to exploit the correlation between the residual MB information in MPEG-2 and the coding mode in H.264/AVC, and the decision tree is derived to determine the candidate modes. The proposed algorithm efficiently reduces the number of candidate modes in H.264/AVC encoder. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve 60 % of transcoding time saving on average with the less PSNR degradation and bitrate increase, comparing with the reference cascaded transcoder.

This is currently a focus of interest among public and private organizations, governments, research institutes and companies operating in diverse fields as health, security, commercial recommendations, detection of anomalies and future trends among others. In this problem, the main objective is to recognize and extract meaningful information (patterns, structure, underlying relationships, etc.) from huge amounts of heterogeneous data. This task is complicated by new, significant storage and processing requirements due to unprecedented volumes of data. In this scenario, new algorithms in Pattern Recognition and related fields are being devised, while well known techniques are revisited and adapted to these new challenges. Latin American research in the "Big Data" problem is still incipient, but there is a significant body of recent works in the subjects of Pattern Recognition and related fields that indirectly addresses the problem. This paper reviews Latin American contributions in Pattern Recognition and related fields in the last lustrum. The focus is set on-but not restricted to-applications in the fields of Computer Vision and Image Analysis with large scale characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One is based on a robust z-score and the other uses a Mahalanobis type robust distance. The methods couple the ideas of point to plane orthogonal distance and local surface point consistency to get Maximum Consistency with Minimum Distance (MCMD). The methods estimate the best-fit-plane based on most probable outlier free, and most consistent, points set in a local neighbourhood. Then the normal and curvature from the best-fit-plane will be highly robust to noise and outliers. Experiments are performed to show the performance of the algorithms compared to several existing well-known methods (from computer vision, data mining, machine learning and statistics) using synthetic and real laser scanning datasets of complex (planar and non-planar) objects. Results for plane fitting, denoising, sharp feature preserving and segmentation are significantly improved. The algorithms are demonstrated to be significantly faster, more accurate and robust. Quantitatively, for a sample size of 50 with 20% outliers the proposed MCMD_Z is approximately 5, 15 and 98 times faster than the existing methods; uLSIF, RANSAC and RPCA, respectively. The proposed MCMD_MD method can tolerate 75% clustered outliers, whereas, RPCA and RANSAC can only tolerate 47% and 64% outliers, respectively. In terms of outlier detection, for the same dataset, MCMD_Z has an accuracy of 99.72%, 0.4% false positive rate and 0% false negative rate; for RPCA, RANSAC and uLSIF, the accuracies are 97.05%, 47.06% and 94.54%, respectively, and they have misclassification rates higher than the proposed methods. The new methods have potential for local surface reconstruction, fitting, and other point cloud processing tasks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The fundamental basis of the RAMARS follows the concept of the GPROF algorithm, which means, being consistent with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar rain rate observations, but independent of any auxiliary information. The RAMARS is built upon the combination of state-of-the-art machine learning and regression techniques, comprising of random forest algorithm, RReliefF, and multivariate adaptive regression splines. The RAMARS is applicable to both over ocean and land as well as coast surface terrains. It has been demonstrated that, when comparing with the TRMM Precipitation Radar observations, the performance of the RAMARS algorithm is comparable with the 2A12 GPROF algorithm. Furthermore, the RAMARS has been applied to two cyclonic cases, hurricane Sandy in 2012, and cyclone Mahasen in 2013, showing a very good capability to reproduce the structure and intensity of the cyclone fields. The RAMARS is highly flexible, because of its four processing components, making it extremely suitable for use to other passive microwave imagers in the global precipitation measurement (GPM) constellation.

J	Gao, XF; Liang, JY				Gao, Xiaofang; Liang, Jiye			An improved incremental nonlinear dimensionality reduction for isometric data embedding	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Manifold learning; Nonlinear dimensionality reduction; Incremental learning; ISOMAP; Design of algorithms		Manifold learning has become a hot issue in the field of machine learning and data mining. There are some algorithms proposed to extract the intrinsic characteristics of different type of high-dimensional data by performing nonlinear dimensionality reduction, such as 1SOMAP, LLE and so on. Most of these algorithms operate in a batch mode and cannot be effectively applied when data are collected sequentially. In this paper, we proposed a new incremental version of ISOMAP which can use the previous computation results as much as possible and effectively update the low dimensional representation of data points as many new samples are accumulated.

Well known regularization methods, including l(2) and l(1) regularization, have shown great success in a variety of conventional learning tasks, and new types of regularization have also been developed to deal with modem problems, such as multi-task learning. In this paper, we introduce the l(2)/l(1) regularization for diverse learning tasks. The l(2)/l(1) regularization is a mixed norm defined over the parameters of the diverse learning tasks. It adaptively encourages the diversity of features among diverse learning tasks, i.e., when a feature is responsible for some tasks it is unlikely to be responsible for the rest of the tasks. We consider two applications of the l(2)/l(1) regularization framework, i.e., learning sparse self-representation of a dataset for clustering and learning one-vs.-rest binary classifiers for multi-class classification, both of which confirm the effectiveness of the new regularization framework over benchmark datasets.

J	Xu, RF; Lee, SJ				Xu, Rong-Fang; Lee, Shie-Jue			Dimensionality reduction by feature clustering for regression problems	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Machine learning; Feature clustering; Feature extraction; Correlation coefficient; Mutual information	SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION; FEATURE-SELECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; SHRINKAGE; VARIABLES; ALGORITHM; LASSO	One of the issues encountered in classification and regression is the processing inefficiency caused by a large number of input dimensions involved in the given training data set. Many dimensionality reduction approaches have been proposed to address this issue by reducing the number of input dimensions and maintaining the generalization capability of the original data set. However, less attention has been paid to regression than to classification. Besides, the computation with covariance matrices involved results in an inefficient reduction process in most existing methods. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based dimensionality reduction approach for regression problems. For a given set of training instances, a group of clusters are formed such that the instances included in the same cluster are similar to each other. Then one new feature is extracted from each cluster through a certain weighted combination of the training instances. Consequently, the dimensionality of the original data set is reduced. The clusters are created incrementally and automatically without the need of specifying the number of clusters in advance by the user. The characteristics of the original data set are substantially retained since all the original features are involved in the derivation of the extracted features. Also, the computation with covariance matrices is avoided, and thus efficiency is maintained. A number of experiments on real-world data sets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Statistical approaches have been extensively adopted for time series forecasting in the past decades. Recently, machine learning techniques have drawn attention and useful forecasting systems based on these techniques have been developed. In this paper, we propose a weighted Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) based approach for time series forecasting. Given a forecasting sequence, a suitable set of training patterns are extracted from the historical data by employing the concepts of k-nearest neighbors and mutual information. Based on the training patterns, a modified LS-SVM is developed to derive a forecasting model which can then be used for forecasting. Our proposed approach has several advantages. It can produce adaptive forecasting models. It works for univariate and multivariate cases. It also works for one-step as well as multi-step forecasting. A number of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for time series forecasting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, ZP; Sun, J; Palade, V; Wang, ST; Liu, Y				Xie, Zhenping; Sun, Jun; Palade, Vasile; Wang, Shitong; Liu, Yuan			Evolutionary sampling: A novel way of machine learning within a probabilistic framework	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Evolutionary sampling; Support sample model; Monte Carlo Markov chain; Rejection sampling; Online learning; Particle swarm optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SEQUENTIAL MONTE-CARLO; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; ENCLOSING BALL; ALGORITHM; TRACKING; LIKELIHOODS; STRATEGIES; PARAMETER; MIXTURE	In many traditional machine learning methods, sampling is only a process of acquiring training data. However, some studies (on sequential Markov chains and particle filters) have demonstrated that sampling can be used for solving some intractable optimization problems in classical learning methods. Along this line of thinking, the relationships between sampling and learning are theoretically exploited in this paper, wherein the key feature of the sampling process is selecting representative samples from original data that can be modeled by a probability distribution. In theory, acquiring reliable samples is not an easy task for an arbitrary probability distribution. Motivated by approaches in evolutionary computation, rejection sampling and function approximation, a novel sampling strategy, called the evolutionary sampling, is proposed in this paper, and a machine learning method, called the evolutionary sampling approach (ESA), is put forward afterwards. Within ESA, a computing model, called the support sample model (SSM), is presented as well and is used to approximate an original density function. Accordingly, a concrete implementation of an evolutionary sampling approach (ESA) is proposed to seek the optimal model parameters of the SSM. Benefiting from the combination of rejection sampling and evolutionary searching, the ESA can theoretically converge to the optimal solution by minimizing the total variation distance, and can do this with high computational efficiency.. Moreover, the normalized factor of a density function can be automatically estimated with high precision within the ESA. As a result, the ESA may be suitable for machine learning problems that could be transformed into density function approximation problems within a probabilistic framework. In addition, derived from the rejection sampling strategy, the ESA can also have online learning abilities required by large-scale data stream processing tasks. Theoretical analyses and application studies are carried out in this paper, and the results demonstrate that the ESA, as a novel way of machine learning, has several prominent merits aspired by past researches in machine learning.

J	Asta, S; Ozcan, E				Asta, Shahriar; Oezcan, Ender			A tensor-based selection hyper-heuristic for cross-domain heuristic search	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Hyper-heuristic; Data science; Machine learning; Move acceptance; Tensor analysis; Algorithm selection	HYPERHEURISTICS; DECOMPOSITION; OPTIMIZATION; RECOGNITION; OBJECTS	Hyper-heuristics have emerged as automated high level search methodologies that manage a set of low level heuristics for solving computationally hard problems. A generic selection hyper-heuristic combines heuristic selection and move acceptance methods under an iterative single point-based search framework. At each step, the solution in hand is modified after applying a selected heuristic and a decision is made whether the new solution is accepted or not. In this study, we represent the trail of a hyper-heuristic as a third order tensor. Factorization of such a tensor reveals the latent relationships between the low level heuristics and the hyper-heuristic itself. The proposed learning approach partitions the set of low level heuristics into two subsets where heuristics in each subset are associated with a separate move acceptance method. Then a multi-stage hyper-heuristic is formed and while solving a given problem instance, heuristics are allowed to operate only in conjunction with the associated acceptance method at each stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time tensor analysis of the space of heuristics is used as a data science approach to improve the performance of a hyper-heuristic in the prescribed manner. The empirical results across six different problem domains from a benchmark indeed indicate the success of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A computationally efficient approach for inverse material characterization combining Gappy POD with direct inversion	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Gappy proper orthogonal decomposition; Direct inversion; Material characterization; Computational inverse mechanics; Inverse problem	PROPER ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; MODULUS RECONSTRUCTION; STRAIN IMAGES; ELASTICITY; DISPLACEMENT; EQUATION; DAMAGE; ELASTOGRAPHY; ALGORITHM	An approach for computationally efficient inverse material characterization from partial-field response measurements that combines the Gappy proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) machine learning technique with a physics-based direct inversion strategy is presented and evaluated. Gappy POD is used to derive a data reconstruction tool from a set of potential system response fields that are generated from available a priori information regarding the potential distribution of the unknown material properties. Then, the Gappy POD technique is applied to reconstruct the full spatial distribution of the system response from whatever portion of the response field has been measured with the chosen system testing method. Lastly, a direct inversion strategy is presented that is derived from the equations governing the system response (i.e., physics of the system), which utilizes the full-field response reconstructed by Gappy POD to produce an estimate of the spatial distribution of the unknown material properties. The direct inversion technique is a particularly computationally efficient inversion technique, requiring a cost equivalent to a single numerical analysis. Therefore, the majority of the computational expense of the presented approach is the one-time potential response generation for the Gappy POD technique, which leads to an approach that is substantially computationally efficient overall. Two numerically simulated examples are shown in which the elastic modulus distribution was characterized based on partial-field displacement response measurements, both static and dynamic. The inversion procedure was shown to have the capability to efficiently provide accurate estimates to material property distributions from partial-field response measurements. The direct inversion with Gappy POD response estimation was also shown to be substantially tolerant to noise in comparison to the direct inversion given measured full-field response. Lastly, a physical example regarding elastography of an arterial construct from ultrasound imaging response measurements is shown to validate the practical applicability of the direct inversion approach with Gappy POD response reconstruction.

J	Natale, F; Carvalho, N; Paulrud, A				Natale, Fabrizio; Carvalho, Natacha; Paulrud, Anton			Defining small-scale fisheries in the EU on the basis of their operational range of activity The Swedish fleet as a case study	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Spatial; GIS; Data mining; Logbook data; Classification; Clustering		Extending the definition of small scale fisheries is a recurrent issue in policy and research debates. A broader definition of small scale fisheries would need to encompass, in addition to vessel size attributes such as vessel length, variables relating to their local operational range, their social role in coastal communities and the economics of the enterprise. In this study, data mining and geospatial analysis techniques were used to explore the relationship between vessel characteristics and local operational range. The process relies heavily on the availability of detailed logbook data and involves two main steps: (I) clustering vessels on the basis of operational range attributes and (2) finding vessel characteristics that best match the operational range classes through machine learning algorithms. The analysis was carried out using the Swedish fishing fleet as a case study and considers the fishing activity of the entire fleet over the period 2007-2013. Swedish logbook data offers the advantage of providing precise spatial information on the location of the catch. Results clearly identified three operational range clusters: local, medium and long range. When considering engine power and vessel tonnage as explanatory variables, the classification algorithms were able to represent the operational range classes with a success rate of 94%. However, the fact that medium size vessels operate and compete in the same operational range class of small size vessels limits, in practice, the possibility of using vessel characteristics to represent univocally the local operational range characteristics of small scale fisheries, unless very high thresholds for power and tonnage are used.

Collaborative Filtering for people-to-people recommendation in online dating: Data analysis and user trial	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Recommender systems; Machine learning; User study	NEWS	A common perception is that online dating systems "match" people on the basis of profiles containing demographic and psychographic information and/or user interests. In contrast, product recommender systems are typically based on Collaborative Filtering, suggesting purchases not based on "content" but on the purchases of "similar" users. In this paper, we study Collaborative Filtering for people-to-people recommendation in online dating, comparing this approach to a baseline Profile Matching method. Initial data analysis highlights the problem of over-recommending popular users, a standard problem for Collaborative Filtering applied to product recommendation, but more acute in people-to-people recommendation. We address this problem with a two-stage recommender process that employs a Decision Tree derived from interactions data as a "critic" to re-rank candidates generated by Collaborative Filtering. Our baseline Profile Matching method dynamically chooses, for each user, attributes that contribute most significantly to successful interactions with candidates having the best matching attribute value. The key evaluation metric is success rate improvement, the increase in the chance of a user having a successful interaction when acting on recommendations. Our methods were first evaluated on historical data from a large online dating site and then trialled live over a 9 week period providing recommendations via e-mail to a large number of users. The trial confirmed the consistency of the analysis on historical data and the ability of our Collaborative Filtering method to generate suitable candidates over an extended period. Moreover, the Collaborative Filtering method gives a higher success rate improvement than Profile Matching. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

FlowBroker: A Software-Defined Network Controller Architecture for Multi-Domain Brokering and Reputation	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Software-defined networking; Multi-domain brokering; Load-balancing; Scalability	MANAGEMENT	Software defined networking (SDN) provides great flexibility by decoupling the control and the data planes, allowing for the implementation of new and innovative network control plane experiments. Presently, the reference implementation for SDN architecture is reliant upon a single controller to push flow rules to all SDN-enabled switches in the network, creating a performance bottleneck and single-point of failure in large networks. To provide a scalable yet efficient solution to distributed SDN network management, we propose FlowBroker, a hierarchical brokering agent layer which manages and coordinates among distributed SDN controllers, where each controller is charged with the flow-rule maintenance of the switches in its managed domain. This paper proposes the FlowBroker architecture as a collaborative multi-domain approach to load balancing and network performance enhancement in software-defined networks. Moreover, we introduce distributed machine learning agents to allow controllers to evaluate which brokers are more advantageous than others, from a performance-based reputation perspective. Simulation results show that the FlowBroker architecture, with broker-based collaborative load-balancing and controller-based distributed reputation, can significantly increase the network performance of a multi-domain software-defined network. FlowBroker yields significant reductions in traffic loss, end-to-end delay and maximum link utilization when cooperative brokering and reputation are utilized.

Objective We aimed to establish current distributions and community arrangements of small mammals to provide important baselines for monitoring and conserving biodiversity into the future. Methods We used 4,408 archived museum and open-access records and the machine learning algorithm, RandomForests, to create high-resolution spatial niche models for 17 species of rodents and shrews in Alaska. Models were validated using independent trapping results from 20 locations stratified along statewide mega-transects, and an average species richness curve was calculated for field samples. Community cluster analyses (varclus) identified geographic patterns of sympatry among species. Species models were summed to create the first small-mammal species richness map for Alaska. Results Species richness increased logarithmically to a mean of 3.3 species per location over 1,500 trapnights. Distribution models yielded mean accuracies of 71 % (45-90 %), and maps correctly predicted a mean of 75 % (60-95 %) of occurrences correctly in the field. Top predictors included Soil Type, Eco-region, Landfire Land-cover, December Sea Ice, and July Temperature at the geographic scale.

Adding 2MASS colours to WISE photometry improves star-galaxy separation efficiency substantially at the expense of losing a small fraction of the galaxies. We find that 93 per cent of the WISE objects within W1 < 15.2 mag have a 2MASS match, and that a class of supervised machine learning algorithms, support vector machines (SVM), are efficient classifiers of objects in our multicolour data set. We constructed a training set from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey PhotoObj table with known star-galaxy separation, and determined redshift distribution of our sample from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly spectroscopic survey. Varying the combination of photometric parameters input into our algorithm we show that W1(WISE) - J(2MASS) is a simple and effective star-galaxy separator, capable of producing results comparable to the multidimensional SVM classification. We present a detailed description of our star-galaxy separation methods, and characterize the robustness of our tools in terms of contamination, completeness, and accuracy. We explore systematics of the full sky WISE-2MASS galaxy map, such as contamination from moon glow. We show that the homogeneity of the full sky galaxy map is improved by an additional J(2MASS) < 16.5 mag flux limit. The all-sky galaxy catalogue we present in this paper covers 21 200 deg(2) with dusty regions masked out, and has an estimated stellar contamination of 1.2 per cent and completeness of 70.1 per cent among 2.4 million galaxies with z(med) approximate to 0.14. WISE-2MASS galaxy maps with well controlled stellar contamination will be useful for spatial statistical analyses, including cross-correlations with other cosmological random fields, such as the cosmic microwave background. The same techniques also yield a statistically controlled sample of stars as well.

Data mining for gravitationally lensed quasars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: statistical; techniques: image processing	DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; DARK-MATTER SUBSTRUCTURE; BROAD-LINE REGION; 7TH DATA RELEASE; TIME DELAYS; GALAXIES; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; CONSTRAINTS; VARIABILITY	Gravitationally lensed quasars are brighter than their unlensed counterparts and produce images with distinctive morphological signatures. Past searches and target-selection algorithms, in particular the Sloan Quasar Lens Search (SQLS), have relied on basic morphological criteria, which were applied to samples of bright, spectroscopically confirmed quasars. The SQLS techniques are not sufficient for searching into new surveys (e.g. DES, PS1, LSST), because spectroscopic information is not readily available and the large data volume requires higher purity in target/candidate selection. We carry out a systematic exploration of machine-learning techniques and demonstrate that a two-step strategy can be highly effective. In the first step, we use catalogue-level information (griz+WISE magnitudes, second moments) to pre-select targets, using artificial neural networks. The accepted targets are then inspected with pixel-by-pixel pattern recognition algorithms (gradient-boosted trees), to form a final set of candidates. The results from this procedure can be used to further refine the simpler SQLS algorithms, with a twofold (or threefold) gain in purity and the same (or 80 per cent) completeness at target-selection stage, or a purity of 70 per cent and a completeness of 60 per cent after the candidate-selection step. Simpler photometric searches in griz+WISE based on colour cuts would provide samples with 7 per cent purity or less. Our technique is extremely fast, as a list of candidates can be obtained from a Stage III experiment (e.g. DES catalogue/data base) in a few CPU hours. The techniques are easily extendable to Stage IV experiments like LSST with the addition of time domain information.

The tuned models were especially found to generalize better and to be more robust compared to other optimization approaches. However, the advantages of the tuning often came along with high computation times, meaning a real burden for employing tuning algorithms. While the training with a reduced number of patterns can be a solution to this, it is often connected with decreasing model accuracies and increasing instabilities and noise. Hence, we propose a novel approach defined by a two criteria optimization task, where both the runtime and the quality of ML models are optimized. Because the budgets for this optimization task are usually very restricted in ML, the surrogate-assisted Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm is adapted. In order to cope with noisy experiments, we apply two hypervolume indicator based EGO algorithms with smoothing and reinterpolation of the surrogate models. The techniques do not need replicates. We find that these EGO techniques can outperform traditional approaches such as latin hypercube sampling (LHS), as well as EGO variants with replicates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hong, TP; Chen, CH; Lin, FS				Hong, Tzung-Pei; Chen, Chun-Hao; Lin, Feng-Shih			Using group genetic algorithm to improve performance of attribute clustering	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Attribute clustering; Feature selection; Genetic algorithm; Grouping genetic algorithm; Data mining	FEATURE-SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION	Feature selection is a pre-processing step in data mining and machine learning, and is very important in analyzing high-dimensional data. Attribute clustering has been proposed for feature selection. If similar attributes can be clustered into groups, they can then be easily replaced by others in the same group when some attribute values are missing. Hong et al. proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) to find appropriate attribute clusters. However, in their approaches, multiple chromosomes represent the same attribute clustering result (feasible solution) due to the combinatorial property, and thus the search space is larger than necessary. This study improves the performance of the GA-based attribute clustering process based on the grouping genetic algorithm (GGA). In the proposed approach, the general GGA representation and operators are used to reduce redundancy in the chromosome representation for attribute clustering. Experiments are also conducted to compare the efficiency of the proposed approach with that of an existing approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can derive attribute grouping results in an effective way. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wallace, BC				Wallace, Byron C.			Computational irony: A survey and new perspectives	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Irony; Representation; Machine learning	VERBAL IRONY; PRETENSE THEORY	Irony is a fundamental rhetorical device. It is a uniquely human mode of communication, curious in that the speaker says something other than what he or she intends. Recently, computationally detecting irony has attracted attention from the natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) communities. While some progress has been made toward this end, I argue that current machine learning methods rely too heavily on shallow, unstructured, syntactic modeling of text to consistently discern ironic intent. Irony detection is an interesting machine learning problem because, in contrast to most text classification tasks, it requires a semantics that cannot be inferred directly from word counts over documents alone. To support this position, I survey the large body of existing philosophical/literary work investigating ironic communication. I then survey more recent computational efforts to operationalize irony detection in the fields of NLP and ML. I identify the disparities of the latter with respect to the former. Specifically, I highlight a major conceptual problem in all existing computational models of irony: none maintain an explicit model of the speaker/environment. I argue that without such an internal model of the speaker, irony detection is hopeless, as this model is necessary to represent expectations, which play a key role in ironic communication. I sketch possible means of embedding such models into computational approaches to irony detection. In particular, I introduce the pragmatic context model, which looks to operationalize computationally existing theories of irony. This work is a step toward unifying work on irony from literary, empirical and philosophical perspectives with modern computational models.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a special type of Machine learning techniques which are computationally inexpensive and provide a sparse solution. This work presents a detailed analysis of various formulations of one-class SVMs, like, hyper-plane, hyper-sphere, quarter-sphere and hyper-ellipsoidal. These formulations are used to separate the normal data from anomalous data. Various techniques based on these formulations have been analyzed in terms of a number of characteristics for harsh environments. These characteristics include input data type, spatio-temporal and attribute correlations, user specified thresholds, outlier types, outlier identification(event/error), outlier degree, susceptibility to dynamic topology, non-stationarity and inhomogeneity. A tabular description of improvement and feasibility of various techniques for deployment in the harsh environments has also been presented.

These hybrid models can effectively use the advantage of each algorithm, so that their performance are better than a single method. In view of their excellent learning performance, the hybrid models of granular computing and support vector machine have become one of the focus at home and abroad. In this paper, the research on the hybrid models are reviewed, which include fuzzy support vector machine, rough support vector machine, quotient space support vector machine, rough fuzzy support vector machine and fuzzy rough support vector machine. Firstly, we briefly introduce the typical granular computing models and the basic theory of support vector machines. Secondly, we describe the latest progress of these hybrid models in recent years.

J	Gong, ML; Qian, YM; Cheng, L				Gong, Minglun; Qian, Yiming; Cheng, Li			Integrated Foreground Segmentation and Boundary Matting for Live Videos	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Foreground segmentation; video matting; support vector machine (SVM); one-class SVM (1SVM)	IMAGE; CAMERA; CUT	The objective of foreground segmentation is to extract the desired foreground object from input videos. Over the years, there have been significant amount of efforts on this topic. Nevertheless, there still lacks a simple yet effective algorithm that can process live videos of objects with fuzzy boundaries (e.g., hair) captured by freely moving cameras. This paper presents an algorithm toward this goal. The key idea is to train and maintain two competing one-class support vector machines at each pixel location, which model local color distributions for both foreground and background, respectively. The usage of two competing local classifiers, as we have advocated, provides higher discriminative power while allowing better handling of ambiguities. By exploiting this proposed machine learning technique, and by addressing both foreground segmentation and boundary matting problems in an integrated manner, our algorithm is shown to be particularly competent at processing a wide range of videos with complex backgrounds from freely moving cameras. This is usually achieved with minimum user interactions. Furthermore, by introducing novel acceleration techniques and by exploiting the parallel structure of the algorithm, near real-time processing speed (14 frames/s without matting and 8 frames/s with matting on a midrange PC & GPU) is achieved for VGA-sized videos.

Automated Classification of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia Using Regional Volumetric Texture Analysis in High-Resolution Computed Tomography	INVESTIGATIVE RADIOLOGY			English	Article						computer-assisted image processing; usual interstitial pneumonia; multidetector computed tomography; computer-assisted diagnosis	IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; NORMATIVE ATLAS; HUMAN LUNG; DIAGNOSIS; QUANTIFICATION; EMPHYSEMA; CT	Objectives: We propose a novel computational approach for the automated classification of classic versus atypical usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Materials and Methods: Thirty-three patients with UIP were enrolled in this study. They were classified as classic versus atypical UIP by a consensus of 2 thoracic radiologists with more than 15 years of experience using the American Thoracic Society evidence-based guidelines for computed tomography diagnosis of UIP. Two cardiothoracic fellows with 1 year of subspecialty training provided independent readings. The system is based on regional characterization of the morphological tissue properties of lung using volumetric texture analysis of multiple-detector computed tomography images. A simple digital atlas with 36 lung subregions is used to locate texture properties, from which the responses of multidirectional Riesz wavelets are obtained. Machine learning is used to aggregate and to map the regional texture attributes to a simple score that can be used to stratify patients with UIP into classic and atypical subtypes. Results: We compared the predictions on the basis of regional volumetric texture analysis with the ground truth established by expert consensus. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the proposed score was estimated to be 0.81 using a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation, with high specificity for classic UIP. The performance of our automated method was found to be similar to that of the 2 fellows and to the agreement between experienced chest radiologists reported in the literature. However, the errors of our method and the fellows occurred on different cases, which suggests that combining human and computerized evaluations may be synergistic. Conclusions: Our results are encouraging and suggest that an automated system may be useful in routine clinical practice as a diagnostic aid for identifying patients with complex lung disease such as classic UIP, obviating the need for invasive surgical lung biopsy and its associated risks.

Many recommended automatic bug assignment approaches are based on text analysis methods such as machine learning and information retrieval methods. Most of these approaches use term-weighting techniques, such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), to determine the value of terms. However, the existing term-weighting techniques only deal with frequency of terms without considering the metadata associated with the terms that exist in software repositories. This paper aims to improve automatic bug assignment by using time-metadata in tf-idf (Time-tf-idf). In the Time-tf-idf technique, the recency of using the term by the developer is considered in determining the values of the developer expertise. An evaluation of the recommended automatic bug assignment approach that uses Time-tf-idf, called ABA-Time-tf-idf, was conducted on three open-source projects. The evaluation shows accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvements of up to 11.8% and 8.94%, respectively, in comparison to the use of tf-idf. Moreover, the ABA-Time-tf-idf approach outperforms the accuracy and MRR of commonly used approaches in automatic bug assignment by up to 45.52% and 55.54%, respectively. Consequently, consideration of time-metadata in term weighting reasonably leads to improvements in automatic bug assignment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the latter case, air quality is not only important for the health and safety of persons, but also for the protection of artworks, which may be damaged from dust, in the form of particulate or fibres. In this paper, we describe a new approach for the detection and analysis of dust by means of machine learning and pattern recognition. The proposed technique relies on a classification algorithm, which aims to identify the characteristics of dust especially in terms of shape and accumulation speed. This information is useful to design efficient countermeasures to reduce the harmful effects of dust and to determine its origin as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reliable diagnosis supported by precise wound evaluation is crucial in order to success on treatment decisions. This paper presents a computer-vision approach to wound-area detection based on statistical colour models. Starting with a training set consisting of 113 real wound images, colour histogram models are created for four different tissue types. Back-projections of colour pixels on those histogram models are used, from a Bayesian perspective, to get an estimate of the posterior probability of a pixel to belong to any of those tissue classes. Performance measures obtained from contingency tables based on a gold standard of segmented images supplied by experts have been used for model selection. The resulting fitted model has been validated on a training set consisting of 322 wound images manually segmented and labelled by expert clinicians. The final fitted segmentation model shows robustness and gives high mean performance rates [(AUC: .9426 (SD .0563); accuracy: .8777 (SD .0799); F-score: 0.7389 (SD .1550); Cohen's kappa: .6585 (SD .1787)] when segmenting significant wound areas that include healing tissues.

The ability to learn powerful features automatically is increasingly important as the volume of data and range of applications of machine learning methods continues to grow. This paper proposes a new deep architecture that uses support vector machines (SVMs) with class probability output networks (CPONs) to provide better generalization power for pattern classification problems. As a result, deep features are extracted without additional feature engineering steps, using multiple layers of the SVM classifiers with CPONs. The proposed structure closely approaches the ideal Bayes classifier as the number of layers increases. Using a simulation of classification problems, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Whalley, I				Whalley, Ian			Developing Telematic Electroacoustic Music: Complex networks, machine intelligence and affective data stream sonification	ORGANISED SOUND			English	Article							INTERNET2; ART	This paper proposes expanding telematic electroacoustic music practice through the consideration of affective computing and integration with complex data streams. Current telematic electroacoustic music practice, despite the distances involved, is largely embedded in older music/sonic arts paradigms. For example, it is dominated by using concert halls, by concerns about the relationship between people and machines, and by concerns about geographically distributed cultures and natural environments. A more suitable environment for telematic sonic works is found in the inter-relationship between 'players' and broader contemporary networked life one embedded in multiple real-time informational data streams. These streams will increase rapidly with the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), and with the increasing deployment of algorithmic decision-making and machine learning software. While collated data streams, such as news feeds, are often rendered visually, they are also partly interpreted through embodied cognition that is similar to music and sonic art interpretation. A meeting point for telematic electroacoustic music and real-time data sonification is in affective composition/performance models and data sonification. These allow for the sonic exploration of participants' place in a matrix of increasingly networked relationships.

This objective is of particular interest because CLZ, though a potentially dangerous drug, can be uniquely effective for otherwise medication-resistant SCZ subjects. We wish to determine whether ML methods can be used to identify a set of EEG-based discriminating features that can simultaneously (1) distinguish all the SCZ subjects before treatment (BT) from healthy volunteer (HV) subjects, (2) distinguish EEGs collected before CLZ treatment (BT) vs. those collected after treatment (AT) for those subjects most responsive to CLZ, (3) discriminate least responsive subjects from HV AT, and (4) no longer discriminate most responsive subjects from HVs AT. If a set of EEG-derived features satisfy these four conditions, then it may be concluded that these features normalize in responsive subjects as a result of CLZ treatment, and therefore potentially provide insight into the functioning of the drug on the SCZ brain. Methods: Odd-ball auditory evoked potentials of 66 HVs and 47 SCZ adults both BT and AT with CLZ were derived from EEG recordings. Treatment outcome, after at least one year follow-up, was assessed through clinical rating scores assigned by an experienced clinician, blind to EEG results. Using a criterion of at least 35% improvement after CLZ treatment, subjects were divided into "most-responsive'' (MR) and "least-responsive'' (LR) groups. As a first step, a brain source localization (BSL) procedure was employed on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from specified brain regions. ML methods were then applied to these source waveform signals to determine whether a set of features satisfying the four conditions outlined above could be discovered. Results: A set of cross-power spectral density (CPSD) features meeting these criteria was identified. These CPSD features, consisting of a combination of brain regional source activity and connectivity measures, significantly overlap with the default mode network (DMN). All decrease with CLZ treatment in responding SCZs. Conclusions: A set of EEG-derived discriminating features which normalize as a result of CLZ treatment was identified. These discriminating features define a network that shares significant commonality with the DMN. Our findings are consistent with those of previous literature, which suggest that regions of the DMN are hyperactive and hyperconnected in SCZ subjects. Our study shows that these discriminating features decrease after treatment, consistent with portions of the DMN normalizing with CLZ therapy in responsive subjects. Significance: Machine learning is proposed as a potentially powerful tool for analysis of the effect of medication on psychiatric illness. If replicated, the proposed approach could be used to gain some improved understanding of the effect of neuroleptic medications in treating psychotic illness. These results may also be useful in the development of new pharmaceuticals, since a new drug which induces changes in brain electrophysiology similar to those seen after CLZ could also have powerful antipsychotic properties.

Sentiment analysis is then becoming an important challenge to understand the polarity beneath these comments. Currently a lot of approaches from natural language processing's perspective have been employed to conduct this task. The widely used ones include bag-of-words and semantic oriented analysis methods. In this research, we further investigate the structural information among words, phrases and sentences within the comments to conduct the sentiment analysis. The idea is inspired by the fact that the structural information is playing important role in identifying the overall statement's polarity. As a result a novel sentiment analysis model is proposed based on recurrent neural network, which takes the partial document as input and then the next parts to predict the sentiment label distribution rather than the next word. The proposed method learns words representation simultaneously the sentiment distribution. Experimental studies have been conducted on commonly used datasets and the results have shown its promising potential.

In order to realize an effective multiview clustering, two issues must be addressed, namely, how to combine the clustering result from each view and how to identify the importance of each view. In this paper, based on a newly proposed objective function which explicitly incorporates two penalty terms, a basic multiview fuzzy clustering algorithm, called collaborative fuzzy c-means (Co-FCM), is firstly proposed. It is then extended into its weighted view version, called weighted view collaborative fuzzy c-means (WV-Co-FCM), by identifying the importance of each view. The WV-Co-FCM algorithm indeed tackles the above two issues simultaneously. Its relationship with the latest multiview fuzzy clustering algorithm Collaborative Fuzzy K-Means (Co-FKM) is also revealed. Extensive experimental results on various multiview datasets indicate that the proposed WV-Co-FCM algorithm outperforms or is at least comparable to the existing state-of-the-art multitask and multiview clustering algorithms and the importance of different views of the datasets can be effectively identified.

Standard classification methods may not be sufficient for such data, and this provides motivation for nonstandard learning settings. One such new learning methodology is called learning through contradiction or Universum-support vector machine (U-SVM). Recent studies have shown U-SVM to be quite effective for sparse highdimensional data sets. However, all these earlier studies have used balanced data sets with equal misclassification costs. This paper extends the U-SVM formulation to problems with different misclassification costs, and presents practical conditions for the effectiveness of this cost-sensitive U-SVM. Several empirical comparisons are presented to validate the proposed approach.

Electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electrooculography signals were recorded continuously while the operator was performing safety-critical process control operations in a simulated human-machine system. In coarse-grained analysis, the adaptive exponential smoothing (AES) technique is used to smooth the psychophysiological data and to remove strong artifacts without requiring templates. The MWL level is classified every 30 s by using bounded support vector machine (BSVM) and tenfold cross-validation techniques. Locality preservation projection (LPP) technique is utilized to derive salient psychophysiological features by means of feature reduction. By combining the AES-LPP and BSVM methods, the accuracy of the coarse-grained MWL classification was significantly improved by 11-13%. On the other hand, to perform MWL classification with higher temporal resolution and cross-subject and cross-trial generalizability, finer-grained data analysis is also conducted to recognize MWL levels every 5 s based on a combination of adaptive BSVM (ABSVM) and AES techniques. In comparison with the use of the BSVM algorithm alone, a significant performance improvement by 10-20% is achieved by using the AES-ABSVM method in the finer-grained MWL classification.

One of the major upgradations required is in the area of early warning generation in case of any grid disturbances such as line contingency leading to cascade failure. This paper proposes a proactive blackout prediction model for a smart grid early warning system. The proposed model evaluates system performance probabilistically, in steady state and under dynamical (line contingency) state, and prepares a historical database for normal and cascade failure states. A support vector machine (SVM) has been trained with this historical database and is used to predict blackout events in advance. The key contribution of this paper is to capture the essence of the cascading failure using probabilistic framework and integration of SVM machine learning tool to build a prediction rule, which would be able to predict the scenarios of the blackout as early as possible. The proposed model is validated using the IEEE 30-bus test-bed system. Proactive prediction of cascade failure using the proposed model may help in realizing the grid resilience feature of smart grid.

Drawing an analogy between discrimination among subspaces and communication over vector wireless channels, we define two Shannon-inspired characterizations of asymptotic classifier performance. First, we define the classification capacity, which characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions for vanishing misclassification probability as the signal dimension, the number of features, and the number of subspaces to be discriminated all approach infinity. Second, we define the diversity-discrimination tradeoff, which, by analogy with the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of fading vector channels, characterizes relationships between the number of discernible subspaces and the misclassification probability as the feature noise power approaches zero. We derive upper and lower bounds on these quantities which are tight in many regimes. Numerical results, including a face recognition application, validate the results in practice.

An advantage of employing fuzzy automaton as a model of machine learning system is its simplicity in design and computation. Also, some standard topological concepts and ideas are used in fuzzy automata and IF-automata to obtain certain results therein. In view of above, it seems that IF-topologies and IF-automata may play vital role in the study of machine learning; the purpose of this work is to introduce and study IF-topologies and to use such studies in the theory of IF-automata.

CRAFFT: an activity prediction model based on Bayesian networks	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Bayesian networks; Activity prediction; Activity recognition; Smart environments; Prompting; Clustering	ENVIRONMENTS	Recent advances in the areas of pervasive computing, data mining, and machine learning offer unique opportunities to provide health monitoring and assistance for individuals facing difficulties to live independently in their homes. Several components have to work together to provide health monitoring for smart home residents including, but not limited to, activity recognition, activity discovery, activity prediction, and prompting system. Compared to the significant research done to discover and recognize activities, less attention has been given to predict the future activities that the resident is likely to perform. Activity prediction components can play a major role in design of a smart home. For instance, by taking advantage of an activity prediction module, a smart home can learn context-aware rules to prompt individuals to initiate important activities. In this paper, we propose an activity prediction model using Bayesian networks together with a novel two-step inference process to predict both the next activity features and the next activity label. We also propose an approach to predict the start time of the next activity which is based on modeling the relative start time of the predicted activity using the continuous normal distribution and outlier detection. To validate our proposed models, we used real data collected from physical smart environments.

We study a learning algorithm for ranking generated by a regularized scheme with an l(1) regularizer. The algorithm is formulated in a data dependent hypothesis space. Such a space is spanned by empirical eigenfunctions which are constructed by a Mercer kernel and the learning data. We establish the computations of empirical eigenfunctions and the representer theorem for the algorithm. Particularly, we provide an analysis of the sparsity and convergence rates for the algorithm. The results show that our algorithm produces both satisfactory convergence rates and sparse representations under a mild condition, especially without assuming sparsity in terms of any basis.

Despite some of the current confounds in the field of functional connectivity MRI, the translational potential of the technique available to investigators may eventually be used to improve diagnosis, early disease detection, and therapy monitoring. Method and ScopeBased on a comprehensive survey of the literature, this review offers an introduction of resting-state functional connectivity for new investigators to the field of resting-state functional connectivity. We discuss a brief history of the technique, various methods of analysis, the relationship of functional networks to behavior, as well as the translational potential of functional connectivity MRI to investigate neuropsychiatric disorders. We also address some considerations and limitations with data analysis and interpretation. ConclusionsThe information provided in this review should serve as a foundation for investigators new to the field of resting-state functional connectivity. The discussion provides a means to better understand functional connectivity and its application to typical and atypical brain function.

Models were trained using in house high-throughput assay data reported as the predicted human hepatic clearance by liver microsomes or pCL(h). Machine learning regression methods were used to generate the models. Model output for a given molecule was reported as its probability of being metabolically stable, thus allowing for synthesis prioritization based on this prediction. Use of probability, instead of the regression value or categories, has been found to be an efficient way for both reporting and assessing predictions. Model performance is evaluated using prospective validation. These models have been integrated into a number of desktop tools, and the models are routinely used to prioritize the synthesis of compounds. We discuss two therapeutic projects at Genentech that exemplify the benefits of a probabilistic approach in applying the models. A three-year retrospective analysis of measured liver microsomes stability data on all registered compounds at Genentech reveals that the use of these models has resulted in an improved metabolic stability profile of synthesized compounds.

As an alternative to widely used scoring approaches, machine learning methods have also been proposed for fast prediction of the binding affinity with promising results, but most of them were developed as all-purpose models despite of the specific functions of different protein families, since proteins from different function families always have different structures and physicochemical features. In this study, we proposed a random forest method to predict the protein-ligand binding affinity based on a comprehensive feature set covering protein sequence, binding pocket, ligand structure and intermolecular interaction. Feature processing and compression was respectively implemented for different protein family datasets, which indicates that different features contribute to different models, so individual representation for each protein family is necessary. Three family-specific models were constructed for three important protein target families of HIV-1 protease, trypsin and carbonic anhydrase respectively. As a comparison, two generic models including diverse protein families were also built. The evaluation results show that models on family-specific datasets have the superior performance to those on the generic datasets and the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients (R (p) and Rs) on the test sets are 0.740, 0.874, 0.735 and 0.697, 0.853, 0.723 for HIV-1 protease, trypsin and carbonic anhydrase respectively. Comparisons with the other methods further demonstrate that individual representation and model construction for each protein family is a more reasonable way in predicting the affinity of one particular protein family.

The procedure consists of three parts: (1) selection of an orthonormal set of basis vectors called eigenquakes to represent characteristic earthquake records; (2) estimation of response spectra for the anticipated level of shaking for a scenario earthquake at a site using Gaussian process regression; and (3) optimal combination of the eigenquakes to generate time series of ground acceleration consistent with the response spectral ordinates obtained in the second part. The paper discusses the benefits of applying such machine-learning methods to strong-motion databases for PSHA and ground motion simulation, particularly in large urban areas where dense instrumentation is available or expected. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is exhibited using four scenario examples for downtown Los Angeles. Advantages, disadvantages, and future research needs for this machine-learning approach to PSHA are discussed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Recent studies exploit the neural signal recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) to get a more objective measurement of perceived video quality. Most of these studies capitalize on the event-related potential component P3. We follow an alternative approach to the measurement problem investigating steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as EEG correlates of quality changes. Unlike the P3, SSVEPs are directly linked to the sensory processing of the stimuli and do not require long experimental sessions to get a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation of the EEG-based measures with the outcome of the standard behavioral assessment. Approach. As stimulus material, we used six gray-level natural images in six levels of degradation that were created by coding the images with the HM10.0 test model of the high efficiency video coding (H.265/MPEG-HEVC) using six different compression rates. The degraded images were presented in rapid alternation with the original images. In this setting, the presence of SSVEPs is a neural marker that objectively indicates the neural processing of the quality changes that are induced by the video coding. We tested two different machine learning methods to classify such potentials based on the modulation of the brain rhythm and on time-locked components, respectively. Main results. Results show high accuracies in classification of the neural signal over the threshold of the perception of the quality changes. Accuracies significantly correlate with the mean opinion scores given by the participants in the standardized degradation category rating quality assessment of the same group of images. Significance. The results show that neural assessment of video quality based on SSVEPs is a viable complement of the behavioral one and a significantly fast alternative to methods based on the P3 component.

The main performance limitations of a SoC estimator originate in limited Battery Management System hardware resources as well as in the battery behavior cross-dependence on the battery chemistry and its cycling conditions. This paper presents a review of methods and models used for SoC estimation and discusses their concept, adaptability and performances in real-time applications. It introduces a novel classification of SoC estimation methods to facilitate the identification of aspects to be improved to create an ideal SoC model. An ideal model is defined as the model that provides a reliable SoC for any battery type and cycling condition, online. The benefits of the machine learning methods in providing an online adaptive SoC estimator are thoroughly detailed. Remaining challenges are specified, through which the characteristics of an ideal model can emerge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When an image is measured by structural similarity (SSIM), two variances, i.e. mean intensity and variance of the image, are used as features. However, the parameters of original copies are actually unavailable in NR applications; hence SSIM is not widely applicable. To extend SSIM in general cases, we apply Gaussian model to fit quantization noise in spatial domain, and directly estimate noise distribution from the compressed version. Benefit from this rearrangement, the revised SSIM does not require original image as the reference. Heavy compression always results in some zero-value DCT coefficients, which need to be compensated for more accurate parameter estimate. By studying the quantization process, a machine-learning based algorithm is proposed to estimate quantization noise taking image content into consideration. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed IQA is more heuristic and efficient. With some experimental results, we verify that the proposed algorithm (provided no reference image) achieves comparable efficacy to some full reference (FR) methods (provided the reference image), such as SSIM.

J	Oyen, D; Lane, T				Oyen, Diane; Lane, Terran			Transfer learning for Bayesian discovery of multiple Bayesian networks	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; Bayesian networks; Transfer learning		Bayesian network structure learning algorithms with limited data are being used in domains such as systems biology and neuroscience to gain insight into the underlying processes that produce observed data. Learning reliable networks from limited data is difficult; therefore, transfer learning can improve the robustness of learned networks by leveraging data from related tasks. Existing transfer learning algorithms for Bayesian network structure learning give a single maximum a posteriori estimate of network models. Yet, many other models may be equally likely, and so a more informative result is provided by Bayesian structure discovery. Bayesian structure discovery algorithms estimate posterior probabilities of structural features, such as edges. We present transfer learning for Bayesian structure discovery which allows us to explore the shared and unique structural features among related tasks. Efficient computation requires that our transfer learning objective factors into local calculations, which we prove is given by a broad class of transfer biases. Theoretically, we show the efficiency of our approach. Empirically, we show that compared to single-task learning, transfer learning is better able to positively identify true edges. We apply the method to whole-brain neuroimaging data.

It has been shown to have a parts-based, sparse representation of the data. NMF has been successfully applied in a variety of areas such as natural language processing, neuroscience, information retrieval, image processing, speech recognition and computational biology for the analysis and interpretation of large-scale data. There has also been simultaneous development of a related statistical latent class modeling approach, namely, probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI), for analyzing and interpreting co-occurrence count data arising in natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generalized statistical approach to NMF and PLSI based on Renyi's divergence between two non-negative matrices, stemming from the Poisson likelihood. Our approach unifies various competing models and provides a unique theoretical framework for these methods. We propose a unified algorithm for NMF and provide a rigorous proof of monotonicity of multiplicative updates for and . In addition, we generalize the relationship between NMF and PLSI within this framework. We demonstrate the applicability and utility of our approach as well as its superior performance relative to existing methods using real-life and simulated document clustering data.

Global patterns in the bycatch of sharks and rays	MARINE POLICY			English	Article						Fisheries discards; Elasmobranch bycatch; Machine learning; Management	PURSE-SEINE FISHERY; TRAWL FISHERY; LONGLINE FISHERY; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; BY-CATCH; ELASMOBRANCHS CAUGHT; SPECIES COMPOSITION; SOUTHERN AFRICA; RANDOM FORESTS; MORTALITY	This study comprised a meta-analysis of elasmobranch bycatch in commercial longline, trawl, purse-seine and gillnet fisheries in order to obtain a general perspective of bycatch patterns, and to expose knowledge gaps and identify management and research priorities. Two bycatch ratios were considered: the number and the weight of elasmobranch bycatch relative to that of the target species captured. Patterns were determined through machine learning algorithms with gear type, oceanic region, habitat and the presence or absence of bycatch management measures as candidate predictors. There are considerable information gaps. Most of the current information on elasmobranch bycatch is for the North Atlantic, which is not where the greatest fishing pressure is exerted, so several fisheries were largely under-represented. Overall for sharks, gear type was the most important predictor with pelagic longline fisheries in the South Atlantic displaying the highest bycatch ratios. No patterns were found for ray bycatch ratios. For the fisheries considered in this study, pelagic longlines, and deep-sea and coastal trawl fisheries had the largest total annual shark and ray bycatch, respectively. Blue sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) dominated the total annual bycatch of longline fisheries. For other fishing gears, the annual species-specific bycatch composition varied across oceanic regions. Many of the fisheries with the largest elasmobranch bycatch operate over large spatial scales and often in international waters. International management, mitigation and cooperation are an essential component for the sustainability of elasmobranch bycatch species. Data collection systems and data availability are required at a global scale to improve assessments of elasmobranch bycatch and this should be a high priority for ongoing management and monitoring.

We then propose a hybrid fuzzy rough with K-nearest neighbor (K-NN)-based classifier (FRNN) to classify the patterns in the reduced datasets, obtained from the fuzzy rough bio-inspired algorithm search. While exploring other possible hybrid evolutionary processes, we then conducted experiments considering (i) same feature selection algorithm with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifier; (ii) instance based selection using synthetic minority over-sampling technique with fuzzy rough K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), SVM and RF classifier. The proposed hybrid is subsequently validated using real-life datasets obtained from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid produces good classification accuracy. Finally, parametric and nonparametric statistical tests of significance are carried out to observe consistency of the classifiers.

This is an important issue for understanding protein folding mechanism and guiding de novo protein design. Twenty naturally occurring amino acids and eight secondary structures consist of a 28-letter alphabet to determine folding kinetics and mechanism. Here we predict folding kinetic rates of proteins from many reduced alphabets. We find that a reduced alphabet of 10 letters achieves good correlation with folding rates, close to the one achieved by full 28-letter alphabet. Many other reduced alphabets are not significantly correlated to folding rates. The finding suggests that not all amino acids and secondary structures are equally important for protein folding. The foldable sequence of a protein could be designed using at least 10 folding units, which can either promote or inhibit protein folding. Reducing alphabet cardinality without losing key folding kinetic information opens the door to potentially faster machine learning and data mining applications in protein structure prediction, sequence alignment and protein design.

This paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM) method to estimate subsurface temperature anomaly (STA) in the Indian Ocean from a suite of satellite remote sensing measurements including sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), and sea surface salinity anomaly (SSSA). The SVM estimation of STA features the inclusion of in-situ Argo STA data for training and testing. SVM, one of the most popular machine learning methods, can well estimate the STA in the upper 1000 m of the Indian Ocean from satellite measurements of sea surface parameters (SSTA, SSHA and SSSA as input attributes for SVM). The results, based on the common SVM application of Support Vector Regression (SVR), were validated for accuracy and reliability using the Argo STA data Both MSE and r(2) for performance measures are improved after including SSSA for SVR (MSE decreased by 12% and r(2) increased by 11% on average). The results showed that SSSA, in addition to SSTA and SSHA, is a useful parameter that can help detect and describe the deeper ocean thermal structure, as well as improve the STA estimation accuracy. Moreover, our method can provide a useful technique for studying subsurface and deeper ocean thermal variability which has played an important role in recent global surface warming hiatus since 1998, from satellite measurements in large basin-wide scale.

One of the important ERPs is the P300 which is an endogenous component of ERPs with a latency of about 300 ms which is elicited by significant stimuli (visual, or auditory). Various machine learning-based classifiers have been used to predict the P300 events and relate them to the human intended activities. However, the vast majority of the employed techniques like Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) and regularized fisher linear discriminant analysis (RFLDA) are black box models which are difficult to understand and analyse by a normal clinician. In addition, due to the inter- and intra-user uncertainties associated with the P300 events, most of the existing classifiers need to be trained for a specific user under specific circumstances and the classifier needs to be retrained for different users or change of circumstances. In this paper, we present an interval type-2 fuzzy logic-based classifier which is able to handle the users' uncertainties to produce better prediction accuracies than other competing classifiers such as BLDA or RFLDA. In addition, the generated type-2 fuzzy classifier is learnt from data via genetic algorithms to produce a small number of rules with a rule length of only one antecedent to maximise the transparency and interpretability for the normal clinician. We also employ a feature selection system based on an ensemble neural networks recursive feature selection which is able to find the effective time instances within the effective sensors in relation to given P300 event. We will present various experiments which were performed on standard data sets and using real-data sets obtained from real subjects' experiments performed in the BCI laboratory in King Abdulaziz University. It will be shown that the produced type-2 fuzzy logic-based classifier will learn simple rules which are easy to understand explaining the events in question. In addition, the produced type-2 fuzzy logic classifier will be able to give better accuracies when compared to BLDA or RFLDA on various human subjects on the standard and real-world data sets.

Utilization of machine-learning algorithms for wind turbine site suitability modeling in Iowa, USA	WIND ENERGY			English	Article						wind energy; turbine site suitability; machine-learning; multicriteria decision making; spatial modeling	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; GIS-BASED APPROACH; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; VISUAL IMPACT; ENERGY; FARMS; PREDICTION; CHINA; SCALE	Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ ecological niche' principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging Init	Prediction of Brain Age Suggests Accelerated Atrophy after Traumatic Brain Injury	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							LIFE-SPAN; COGNITIVE DECLINE; INFLAMMATION; MORPHOMETRY; PATTERNS; MATURITY; SINGLE	ObjectiveThe long-term effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) can resemble observed in normal ageing, suggesting that TBI may accelerate the ageing process. We investigate this using a neuroimaging model that predicts brain age in healthy individuals and then apply it to TBI patients. We define individuals' differences in chronological and predicted structural "brain age," and test whether TBI produces progressive atrophy and how this relates to cognitive function. MethodsA predictive model of normal ageing was defined using machine learning in 1,537 healthy individuals, based on magnetic resonance imaging-derived estimates of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). This ageing model was then applied to test 99 TBI patients and 113 healthy controls to estimate brain age. ResultsThe initial model accurately predicted age in healthy individuals (r=0.92). TBI brains were estimated to be "older," with a mean predicted age difference (PAD) between chronological and estimated brain age of 4.66 years (10.8) for GM and 5.97 years (+/- 11.22) for WM. This PAD predicted cognitive impairment and correlated strongly with the time since TBI, indicating that brain tissue loss increases throughout the chronic postinjury phase. InterpretationTBI patients' brains were estimated to be older than their chronological age. This discrepancy increases with time since injury, suggesting that TBI accelerates the rate of brain atrophy. This may be an important factor in the increased susceptibility in TBI patients for dementia and other age-associated conditions, motivating further research into the age-like effects of brain injury and other neurological diseases.

More specifically, within a Machine Learning framework, we use data from a variety of short (treasury bills) and long term interest rates (bonds) for the period from 1976:Q3 to 2011:Q4 in conjunction with the real GDP for the same period, to create a model that can successfully forecast output fluctuations (inflation and output gaps) around its long-run trend. We focus our attention in correctly forecasting the instances of output gaps referred for the purposes of our analysis here as recessions. In this effort, we applied a Support Vector Machines technique for classification. The results show that we can achieve an overall forecasting accuracy of 66.7 and 100 % accuracy in forecasting recessions. These results are compared to the alternative standard logit and probit model, to provide further evidence about the significance of our original model.

Detection of temporal lobe epilepsy using support vector machines in multi-parametric quantitative MR imaging	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						MRI; DESPOT; DTI; FA; MD; Quantitative imaging; Feature selection; MRMR; ANOVA; Support vector machines; Machine learning; SVM; ROI; PCA; TLE; Epilepsy	FEATURE-SELECTION; SAMPLE-SIZE; STEADY-STATE; BRAIN; SCLEROSIS; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; DESPOT1; IMAGES; CORTEX	The detection of MRI abnormalities that can be associated to seizures in the study of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging task. In many cases, patients with a record of epileptic activity do not present any discernible MRI findings. In this domain, we propose a method that combines quantitative relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with support vector machines (SVM) aiming to improve TLE detection. The main contribution of this work is two-fold: on one hand, the feature selection process, principal component analysis (PCA) transformations of the feature space, and SVM parameterization are analyzed as factors constituting a classification model and influencing its quality. On the other hand, several of these classification models are studied to determine the optimal strategy for the identification of TLE patients using data collected from multi-parametric quantitative MRI. A total of 17 TLE patients and 19 control volunteers were analyzed. Four images were considered for each subject (T1 map, T2 map, fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity) generating 936 regions of interest per subject, then 8 different classification models were studied, each one comprised by a distinct set of factors. Subjects were correctly classified with an accuracy of 88.9%. Further analysis revealed that the heterogeneous nature of the disease impeded an optimal outcome. After dividing patients into cohesive groups (9 left-sided seizure onset, 8 right-sided seizure onset) perfect classification for the left group was achieved (100% accuracy) whereas the accuracy for the right group remained the same (88.9%). We conclude that a linear SVM combined with an ANOVA-based feature selection +PCA method is a good alternative in scenarios like ours where feature spaces are high dimensional, and the sample size is limited. The good accuracy results and the localization of the respective features in the temporal lobe suggest that a multi-parametric quantitative MRI, ROI-based, SVM classification could be used for the identification of TLE patients. This method has the potential to improve the diagnostic assessment, especially for patients who do not have any obvious lesions in standard radiological examinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, existing algorithms for microscopy cell detection usually ignore the large variations of cells and only focus on the shape feature/descriptor design. Here we propose a new two-layer model for cell centre detection by a two-layer structure prediction framework, which is respectively built on classification for the cell centres implicitly using rich appearances and contextual information and explicit structural information for the cells. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method over competing state-of-the-art methods, providing a viable alternative for microscopy cell detection.

In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based method for needle segmentation in 2D beam-steered ultrasound images. We used a statistical boosting approach to train a pixel-wise classifier for needle segmentation. The Radon transform was then used to find the needle position and orientation from the segmented image. We validated our method with data from ex vivo specimens and clinical nerve block procedures, and compared the results to those obtained using previously reported needle segmentation methods. Results show improved localization success and accuracy using the proposed method. For the ex vivo datasets, assuming that the needle orientation was known a priori, the needle was successfully localized in 86.2% of the images, with a mean targeting error of 0.48 mm. The robustness of the proposed method to a lack of a priori knowledge of needle orientation was also demonstrated. For the clinical datasets, assuming that the needle orientation was closely aligned with the beam steering angle selected by the physician, the needle was successfully localized in 99.8% of the images, with a mean targeting error 0.19 mm. These results indicate that the learning-based segmentation method may allow for increased targeting accuracy and enhanced visualization during ultrasound-guided needle procedures.

Therefore, we introduce a learning-based paradigm that aims at (1) identifying the relevant objects or anatomy in both Kinect and X-ray data, and (2) creating an object-specific pixel-wise alpha map that permits relevance-based fusion of the video and the X-ray images within one single view.

To fully unravel the underlying nonlinear manifold the selection of an adequate kernel function and of its free parameters is critical. In practice, however, the kernel function is generally chosen as Gaussian or polynomial and such standard kernels might not always be optimal for a given image dataset or application. In this paper, we present a study on the effect of the kernel functions in nonlinear manifold embedding of medical image data. To this end, we first carry out a literature review on existing advanced kernels developed in the statistics, machine learning, and signal processing communities. In addition, we implement kernel-based formulations of well-known nonlinear dimensional reduction techniques such as Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding, thus obtaining a unified framework for manifold embedding using kernels. Subsequently, we present a method to automatically choose a kernel function and its associated parameters from a pool of kernel candidates, with the aim to generate the most optimal manifold embeddings. Furthermore, we show how the calculated selection measures can be extended to take into account the spatial relationships in images, or used to combine several kernels to further improve the embedding results. Experiments are then carried out on various synthetic and phantom datasets for numerical assessment of the methods. Furthermore, the workflow is applied to real data that include brain manifolds and multispectral images to demonstrate the importance of the kernel selection in the analysis of high-dimensional medical images.

Considerable research has been conducted in these fields to optimize maintenance actions. Most research proposes approaches based on physics: physical model of a specific failure, law of aging, etc. In spite of their performance, these approaches are quite difficult to implement on a complex integrated system. Each field of expertise assesses the good health of a system part using its own experts, its own methods, and, in some cases, its own data. Nevertheless, these fields all make up the same machine, and no interaction between systems is considered. Our study is not based on physical approaches but uses operational data and mathematical tools to diagnose, off-line, the current state of the system. The proposed paper concerns a new concept consisting in characterizing normal system functioning by using data recorded during monitoring. The life profile of this complex system is described by employing all the available data to determine, on the one hand, all normal events and, on the other, to identify abnormal events according to their position compared to the normal envelope defined. The recorded data are then specifically analyzed to characterize the level of criticism of an event considered to be abnormal. This abnormal event could then be assimilated to a global behavioral drift of the studied behavior, which is different to usual behavior. This approach is applied to helicopters by use of all flight recorded data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Figueroa, A				Figueroa, Alejandro			Exploring effective features for recognizing the user intent behind web queries	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						Search query understanding; Query classification; Query analysis; User intent; User experience; Feature analysis		Automatically identifying the user intent behind web queries has started to catch the attention of the research community, since it allows search engines to enhance user experience by adapting results to that goal. It is broadly agreed that there are three archetypal intentions behind search queries: navigational, resource/transactional and informational. Thus, as a natural consequence, this task has been interpreted as a multi-class classification problem. At large, recent works have focused on comparing several machine learning Methods built with words as features. Conversely, this paper examines the influence of assorted properties on three classification approaches. In particular, it focuses its attention on the contribution of linguistic-based attributes. However, most of natural language processing tools are designed for documents, not web queries. Therefore, as a means of bridging this linguistic gap, we benefited from caseless models, which are trained with traditionally labeled data, but all terms are converted to lowercase before their generation. Overall, tested attributes proved to be effective by improving on word-based classifiers by up to 8.347% (accuracy), and outperforming a baseline by up to 6.17%. Most notably, linguistic-oriented features, from caseless models, are shown to be instrumental in narrowing the linguistic gap between queries and documents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sonnenschein, M; Lunsdorf, O; Bremer, J; Trochel, M				Sonnenschein, Michael; Luensdorf, Ontje; Bremer, Joerg; Troechel, Martin			Decentralized control of units in smart grids for the support of renewable energy supply	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW			English	Article						Smart grids; Local demand-supply-matching in power grids; System integration of renewable energy; Virtual power plants; Self-organization	OPTIMIZATION	Due to the significant environmental impact of power production from fossil fuels and nuclear fission, future energy systems will increasingly rely on distributed and renewable energy sources (RES). The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand-supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets.

Three logic form transformations taking into account semantic structure of sentences are proposed. Logic proofs are obtained using an adapted resolution step that drops predicates when a proof cannot be found with standard resolution. Features are extracted from proofs and combined using supervised machine learning to obtain the final similarity scores. Experimental results show that taking into account semantic relations to determine textual similarity yields performance improvements with respect to both baselines and third-party state-of-the-art systems. Specific sentence pairs that benefit from considering semantic relations are discussed. Detailed results provide empirical evidence that either proof direction offers a strong baseline although considering both is beneficial, and that ignoring concepts that are not an argument of a semantic relation is not sound.

Although studies have applied machine learning methods for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD, a bottleneck in the diagnostic performance was shown in previous methods, due to the lacking of efficient strategies for representing neuroimaging biomarkers. In this study, we designed a novel diagnostic framework with deep learning architecture to aid the diagnosis of AD. This framework uses a zero-masking strategy for data fusion to extract complementary information from multiple data modalities. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art workflows, our method is capable of fusing multimodal neuroimaging features in one setting and has the potential to require less labeled data. A performance gain was achieved in both binary classification and multiclass classification of AD. The advantages and limitations of the proposed framework are discussed.

Exploiting the manifold regularization (MR), Belkin et al. proposed a new semisupervised classification algorithm: Laplacian support vector machines (LapSVMs), and have shown the state-of-the-art performance in SSL field. To further improve the LapSVMs, we proposed a fast Laplacian SVM (FLapSVM) solver for classification. Compared with the standard LapSVM, our method has several improved advantages as follows: 1) FLapSVM does not need to deal with the extra matrix and burden the computations related to the variable switching, which make it more suitable for large scale problems; 2) FLapSVM's dual problem has the same elegant formulation as that of standard SVMs. This means that the kernel trick can be applied directly into the optimization model; and 3) FLapSVM can be effectively solved by successive overrelaxation technology, which converges linearly to a solution and can process very large data sets that need not reside in memory. In practice, combining the strategies of random scheduling of subproblem and two stopping conditions, the computing speed of FLapSVM is rigidly quicker to that of LapSVM and it is a valid alternative to PLapSVM.

Recently-proposed interaction-free calibration methods [16, 17] automatically estimate this projection by tracking the user's eye position, thereby freeing users from tedious manual calibrations. However, the method is still prone to contain systematic calibration errors. Such errors stem from eye-/HMD-related factors and are not represented in the conventional eye-HMD model used for HMD calibration. This paper investigates one of these factors - the fact that optical elements of OST-HMDs distort incoming world-light rays before they reach the eye, just as corrective glasses do. Any OST-HMD requires an optical element to display a virtual screen. Each such optical element has different distortions. Since users see a distorted world through the element, ignoring this distortion degenerates the projection quality. We propose a light-field correction method, based on a machine learning technique, which compensates the world-scene distortion caused by OST-HMD optics. We demonstrate that our method reduces the systematic error and significantly increases the calibration accuracy of the interaction-free calibration.

Such combinatorial regulation plays an important role in development and facilitates the ability of cells to respond to different stresses. While a number of approaches have utilized sequence and ChIP-based datasets to study combinational regulation, these have often ignored the combinational logic and the dynamics associated with such regulation. Here we present cDREM, a new method for reconstructing dynamic models of combinatorial regulation. cDREM integrates time series gene expression data with (static) protein interaction data. The method is based on a hidden Markov model and utilizes the sparse group Lasso to identify small subsets of combinatorially active TFs, their time of activation, and the logical function they implement. We tested cDREM on yeast and human data sets. Using yeast we show that the predicted combinatorial sets agree with other high throughput genomic datasets and improve upon prior methods developed to infer combinatorial regulation. Applying cDREM to study human response to flu, we were able to identify several combinatorial TF sets, some of which were known to regulate immune response while others represent novel combinations of important TFs.

However, many problems encountered in the field of informetrics face us with the need to extend these kinds of methods in a way such that they may be computed over a set of nonincreasingly ordered vectors of unequal lengths. Thus, in this paper, some new dissimilarity measures (metrics) are introduced and studied. Owing to that we may use, e.g. hierarchical clustering algorithms in order to determine an input data set's partition consisting of sets of producers that are homogeneous not only with respect to the quality of information resources, but also their quantity.

Many IDS have been developed based on machine learning techniques. Specifically, advanced detection approaches created by combining or integrating multiple learning techniques have shown better detection performance than general single learning techniques. The feature representation method is an important pattern classifier that facilitates correct classifications, however, there have been very few related studies focusing how to extract more representative features for normal connections and effective detection of attacks. This paper proposes a novel feature representation approach, namely the cluster center and nearest neighbor (CANN) approach. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed, the first one based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection by a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that the CANN classifier not only performs better than or similar to k-NN and support vector machines trained and tested by the original feature representation in terms of classification accuracy, detection rates, and false alarms. I also provides high computational efficiency for the time of classifier training and testing (i.e., detection). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The first commercially available accelerometer for assessing PA, the Caltrac, was worn on the waist and estimated PA energy expenditure in kilocalories. Around 1995, the emphasis shifted to measuring minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), especially for bouts of 10 min or longer. Recent studies, however, show that light-intensity PA and intermittent (nonbout) MVPA also have important health benefits. The total volume of PA performed is an important variable because it takes the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity bouts and condenses them down into a single metric. The total volume of PA is appropriate for many research applications and can enhance comparisons between studies. In the future, machine learning algorithms will provide improved accuracy for activity type recognition and estimation of PA energy expenditure. However, in the current landscape of objectively measured PA, total activity counts per day (TAC/d) is a proxy for the total volume of PA. TAC/d percentiles for age- and gender-specific groups have been developed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ActiGraph data (2003-2006), providing a novel way to assess PA. The use of TAC/d or standardized units of acceleration could harmonize PA across studies. TAC/d should be viewed as an additional metric, not intended to replace other metrics (e.g., sedentary time, light-intensity PA, moderate PA, and vigorous PA) that may also be related to health. As future refinements to wearable monitors occur, researchers should continue to consider metrics that reflect the total volume of PA in addition to existing PA metrics.

However, previous motion detection algorithms fail to achieve the flexibility and accuracy simultaneously for good detection results. In the present work, a scene-adaptive motion detection model based on machine learning and clustering technology is proposed. This model begins with training to the system by a group of testing images, in terms of various accurate parameters of one certain scene. Significant modifications have been reserved in the same area during motion detection, which are considered as a change clustering. Then, the model takes advantage of clustering technology to generate a minimum spanning tree (MST), which is one kind of average linkage clustering. The average shortest distance of the minimum spanning tree serves as a benchmark to identify the change in images. Finally the training parameters and detection algorithm are combined to monitor the scene.

J	Geng, GG; Lee, XD; Zhang, YM				Geng, Guang-Gang; Lee, Xiao-Dong; Zhang, Yan-Ming			Combating phishing attacks via brand identity and authorization features	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						brand identity recognition; phishing attacks; brand authorization feature; machine learning		Phishing, also called brand spoofing, has become the most troubling scam on the Internet, which seriously threatens the Web security. The essence of phish is that "robbers" use false sites, which look like a trustworthy brand site, where favicon, logo and copyright notice are important brand identities. We analyzed 78-day phishing data of PhishTank and Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). The statistics show that more than 98.93% phishing sites contain at least one brand entity-favicon, logo or copyright notice. Indeed, only a few lowest-quality phishing campaigns do not use such brand elements. Obviously, brand entities are powerful weapons of phishers to trick users. By analyzing the characteristics of brand entities in phishing sites, several brand identity features are extracted. However, only brand entities do not consider whether the Web page with brand entities belongs to the corresponding brand or has an authorization to use the brand entities. To solve this problem, redirection, incoming links and Domain Name System (DNS) information-based brand authorization features are further extracted to discriminate the sites with branding rights from phishing sites. Based on extracted features, statistical anti-phishing classification models are trained. We collected a diverse spectrum of corpora containing 3863 phishing cases from PhishTank and APWG, and 17 571 legitimate samples from DMOZ, Google and DNS resolution log. Experimental evaluations show that the model achieves 98.8% true positive rate and 0.09% false positive rate, which demonstrates the competitive performances of extracted features for statistical anti-phishing in practice.

The prevalent use of obfuscation techniques to hide malicious codes and to preserve copyrights of benign scripts resulted in (i) missing detection of malicious scripts that are obfuscated and (ii) raising false alarms due to the benign scripts that are obfuscated. Automatic detection of obfuscated JavaScript is generally undertaken by tackling the problem from the readability perspective. Recently, Microsoft research team analyzed different levels of context-based features to distinguish obfuscated malicious scripts from obfuscated benign ones. In this work, we raise the issue of existing readable versions of obfuscated scripts. Further, we discuss the challenges posed by readably obfuscated scripts against both JavaScript malware detectors and obfuscated scripts detectors. Therefore, we propose JavaScript Obfuscation Detector (JSOD), a completely static solution to detect obfuscated scripts including readable patterns. To evaluate JSOD, we compare it to the state-of-the-art approaches to detect obfuscated malicious and obfuscated benign script, namely, Zozzle and Nofus. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance to detect readably obfuscated scripts and their sophisticated variations. Furthermore, they also show the superiority of JSOD approach against all relevant solutions. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A variety of reverse engineering methods from machine learning and computational statistics have been proposed and evaluated. The emphasis of the present paper is on combining models in a model ensemble to boost the network reconstruction accuracy, and to explore various model combination strategies to maximize the improvement. Our results demonstrate that a rich ensemble of predictors outperforms the best individual model, even if the ensemble includes poor predictors with inferior individual reconstruction accuracy. For our application to metabolomic and transcriptomic time series from various mutagenesis plants grown in different light-dark cycles we also show how to determine the optimal time lag between interactions, and we identify significant interactions with a randomization test. Our study predicts new statistically significant interactions between circadian clock genes and metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana, and thus provides independent statistical evidence that the regulation of metabolism by the circadian clock is not uni-directional, but that there is a statistically significant feedback mechanism aiming from metabolism back to the circadian clock.

Identifying such interconnected and jointly altered gene/protein groups from functional omics data and a given molecular interaction network is a key challenge in bioinformatics. We describe GenePEN, a penalized logistic regression approach for sample classification via convex optimization, using a newly designed Pairwise Elastic Net penalty that favors the selection of discriminative genes/proteins according to their connectedness in a molecular interaction graph.

Recently, functional connectivity graphs (FCGs) have entered into the picture. In the related decoding scheme, FCGs are treated as unstructured data and, hence, their inherent format is overlooked. To alleviate this, tensor subspace analysis (TSA) is incorporated for the parsimonious representation of connectivity data. In addition to the particular methodological innovation, this work also makes a contribution at a conceptual level by encoding in FCGs cross-frequency coupling apart from the conventional frequency-specific interactions. Working memory related tasks, supported by networks oscillating at different frequencies, are good candidates for assessing the novel approach. We employed surface EEG recordings when the subjects were repeatedly performing a mental arithmetic task of five cognitive workload levels. For each trial, an FCG was constructed based on phase interactions within and between Frontal (theta) and Parieto-Occipital (alpha 2) neural activities, which are considered to reflect the function of two distinct working memory subsystems. Based on the TSA representation, a remarkably high correct-recognition-rate (96%) of the task difficulties was achieved using a standard classifier. The overall scheme is computational efficient and therefore potentially useful for real-time and personalized applications.

AGD uses derivative spectroscopy and machine learning to provide optimized guesses for the number of Gaussian components in the data, and also their locations, widths, and amplitudes. We test AGD and find that it produces results comparable to human-derived solutions on 21 cm absorption spectra from the 21 cm SPectral line Observations of Neutral Gas with the EVLA (21-SPONGE) survey. We use AGD with Monte Carlo methods to derive the H I line completeness as a function of peak optical depth and velocity width for the 21-SPONGE data, and also show that the results of AGD are stable against varying observational noise intensity. The autonomy and computational efficiency of the method over traditional manual Gaussian fits allow for truly unbiased comparisons between observations and simulations, and for the ability to scale up and interpret the very large data volumes from the upcoming Square Kilometer Array and pathfinder telescopes.

J	Kim, M; Farnoud, F; Milenkovic, O				Kim, Minji; Farnoud, Farzad; Milenkovic, Olgica			HyDRA: gene prioritization via hybrid distance-score rank aggregation	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							NETWORK-BASED PRIORITIZATION; CANDIDATE DISEASE GENES; DATA FUSION; ASSOCIATION; INTEGRATION; ALGORITHMS; SIMILARITY; PREDICTION; SERVER	A Summary: Gene prioritization refers to a family of computational techniques for inferring disease genes through a set of training genes and carefully chosen similarity criteria. Test genes are scored based on their average similarity to the training set, and the rankings of genes under various similarity criteria are aggregated via statistical methods. The contributions of our work are threefold: (i) first, based on the realization that there is no unique way to define an optimal aggregate for rankings, we investigate the predictive quality of a number of new aggregation methods and known fusion techniques from machine learning and social choice theory. Within this context, we quantify the influence of the number of training genes and similarity criteria on the diagnostic quality of the aggregate and perform in-depth cross-validation studies; (ii) second, we propose a new approach to genomic data aggregation, termed HyDRA (Hybrid Distance-score Rank Aggregation), which combines the advantages of score-based and combinatorial aggregation techniques. We also propose incorporating a new top-versus-bottom (TvB) weighting feature into the hybrid schemes. The TvB feature ensures that aggregates are more reliable at the top of the list, rather than at the bottom, since only top candidates are tested experimentally; (iii) third, we propose an iterative procedure for gene discovery that operates via successful augmentation of the set of training genes by genes discovered in previous rounds, checked for consistency. Motivation: Fundamental results from social choice theory, political and computer sciences, and statistics have shown that there exists no consistent, fair and unique way to aggregate rankings. Instead, one has to decide on an aggregation approach using predefined set of desirable properties for the aggregate. The aggregation methods fall into two categories, score-and distance-based approaches, each of which has its own drawbacks and advantages. This work is motivated by the observation that merging these two techniques in a computationally efficient manner, and by incorporating additional constraints, one can ensure that the predictive quality of the resulting aggregation algorithm is very high. Results: We tested HyDRA on a number of gene sets, including autism, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometriosis, ischaemic stroke, leukemia, lymphoma and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, we performed iterative gene discovery for glioblastoma, meningioma and breast cancer, using a sequentially augmented list of training genes related to the Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni condition and other diseases. The methods outperform state-of-the-art software tools such as ToppGene and Endeavour. Despite this finding, we recommend as best practice to take the union of top-ranked items produced by different methods for the final aggregated list.

The literature describes numerical and semi-empirical models that characterize ship speed in ice. These however often fail to account for the joint effect of the ice conditions on ship's speed. Moreover, they omit the effect of ice compression. The latter, when combined with the presence of ridges, can significantly limit the capabilities of an ice-strengthened ship, and potentially bring her to a halt, even if the actual ice conditions are within the design range for the given ship. This paper introduces two probabilistic, data-driven models that predict a ship's speed and the situations where a ship is likely to get stuck in ice based on the joint effect of ice features such as the thickness and concentration of level ice, ice ridges, rafted ice, moreover ice compression is considered. To develop the models, two full-scale datasets were utilized. First, the dataset about the performance of a selected ship in ice is acquired from the automatic identification system. Second, the dataset containing numerical description of the ice field is obtained from a numerical ice model HELMI, developed in the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The collected datasets describe a single and unassisted trip of an ice-strengthened bulk carrier between two Finnish ports in the presence of challenging ice conditions, which varied in time and space. The relations between ship performance and the ice conditions were established using Bayesian networks and selected learning algorithms. The obtained results show good prediction power of the models. This means, on average 80% for predicting the ship's speed within specified bins, and above 90% for predicting cases where a ship may get stuck in ice. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Motivated by this issue, this study develops a classifier approach denoted as BSMAIRS. This approach combines borderline synthetic minority oversampling technique (BSM) and artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) as global optimization searcher with the nearest neighbor algorithm used as a local classifier. Eight electronic medical datasets collected from University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository were used to evaluate the effectiveness and to justify the performance of the proposed BSMAIRS. Comparisons with several well-known classifiers were conducted based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and G-mean. Statistical results concluded that BSMAIRS can be used as an efficient method to handle imbalanced class problems. To further confirm its performance, BSMAIRS was applied to real imbalanced medical data of lung cancer metastasis to the brain that were collected from National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan. This application can function as a supplementary tool for doctors in the early diagnosis of brain metastasis from lung cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A variety of geophysical logs may provide the required data but, in the case of banded iron formation hosted iron ore deposits in the Hamersley Ranges of Western Australia, only one geophysical log type (natural gamma) is collected for this purpose. The information from these logs is currently processed by slow manual interpretation. In this paper we present an alternative method of automatically identifying recurring stratigraphic markers in natural gamma logs from multiple drill holes. Our approach is demonstrated using natural gamma geophysical logs that contain features corresponding to the presence of stratigraphically important marker shales. The host stratigraphic sequence is highly consistent throughout the Hamersley and the marker shales can therefore be used to identify the stratigraphic location of the banded iron formation (BIF) or BIF hosted ore. The marker shales are identified using Gaussian Processes (GP) trained by either manual or active learning methods and the results are compared to the existing geological interpretation. The manual method involves the user selecting the signatures for improving the library, whereas the active learning method uses the measure of uncertainty provided by the GP to select specific examples for the user to consider for addition. The results demonstrate that both GP methods can identify a feature, but the active learning approach has several benefits over the manual method. These benefits include greater accuracy in the identified signatures, faster library building, and an objective approach for selecting signatures that includes the full range of signatures across a deposit in the library. When using the active learning method, it was found that the current manual interpretation could be replaced in 78.4% of the holes with an accuracy of 95.7%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Till now, determination of PQ levels in blood or urine is still the only way to confirm the PQ poisoning. In order to develop a new diagnostic method, the potential of machine learning technique was explored in this study. A newly,developed classification technique, extreme learning machine (ELM), was taken to discriminate the PQ-poisoned patients from the healthy controls. 15 PQ-poisoned patients recruited from The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University who had a history of direct contact with PQ and 16 healthy volunteers were involved in the study. The ELM method is examined based on the metabolites of blood samples determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) criterion, respectively. Additionally, the feature selection was also investigated to further boost the performance of ELM and the most influential feature was detected. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be regarded as a success with the excellent classification accuracy, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 91.64%, 0.9156%, 9133% and 91.78%, respectively. Promisingly, the proposed method might serve as a new candidate of powerful tools for diagnosis of PQ-poisoned patients with excellent performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using historical patient information stored in clinical datasets, data mining and machine learning approaches can be applied to predict the survival of breast cancer patients. A common drawback is the absence of information, i.e., missing data, in certain clinical trials. However, most standard prediction methods are not able to handle incomplete samples and, then, missing data imputation is a widely applied approach for solving this inconvenience. Therefore, and taking into account the characteristics of each breast cancer dataset, it is required to perform a detailed analysis to determine the most appropriate imputation and prediction methods in each clinical environment This research work analyzes a real breast cancer dataset from Institute Portuguese of Oncology of Porto with a high percentage of unknown categorical information (most clinical data of the patients are incomplete), which is a challenge in terms of complexity. Four scenarios are evaluated: (I) 5-year survival prediction without imputation and 5-year survival prediction from cleaned dataset with (II) Mode imputation, (Ill) Expectation-Maximization imputation and (IV) K-Nearest Neighbors imputation. Prediction models for breast cancer survivability are constructed using four different methods: K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. Experiments are performed in a nested ten-fold cross-validation procedure and, according to the obtained results, the best results are provided by the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm: more than 81% of accuracy and more than 0.78 of area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve, which constitutes very good results in this complex scenario.

This paper describes a study to build predictive models to identify parts of the software that have high probability of occurrence of fault. We have considered the effect of thresholds of object-oriented metrics on fault proneness and built predictive models based on the threshold values of the metrics used. Prediction of fault prone classes in earlier phases of software development life cycle will help software developers in allocating the resources efficiently. In this paper, we have used a statistical model derived from logistic regression to calculate the threshold values of object oriented, Chidamber and Kemerer metrics. Thresholds help developers to alarm the classes that fall outside a specified risk level. In this way, using the threshold values, we can divide the classes into two levels of risk - low risk and high risk. We have shown threshold effects at various risk levels and validated the use of these thresholds on a public domain, proprietary dataset, KC1 obtained from NASA and two open source, Promise datasets, IVY and JEdit using various machine learning methods and data mining classifiers. Interproject validation has also been carried out on three different open source datasets, Ant and Tomcat and Sakura. This will provide practitioners and researchers with well formed theories and generalised results. The results concluded that the proposed threshold methodology works well for the projects of similar nature or having similar characteristics.

In such applications, there is an increasing emphasis on inference functions. Machine- learning algorithms play an important role by enabling the construction of data-driven models for inference over data that is too complex to model analytically. This paper explores how data-driven training can be exploited to also overcome computational errors due to hardware faults within an inference stage. FPGA emulation with randomized fault injections shows that the proposed architecture restores system performance to the level of a fault free system, with <1% of the hardware requiring explicit fault protection, and with digital faults affecting >2% of the circuit nodes in the rest of the hardware. To train an error-aware inference model, a training algorithm is presented whose hardware (memory) and energy requirements are reduced by 65X and 10X compared to previously reported algorithms (AdaBoost and FilterBoost respectively), thereby enabling model construction entirely on the device.

An important topic in ROC analysis is the ROC convex hull (ROCCH), which is the least convex majorant (LCM) of the empirical ROC curve and covers potential optima for a given set of classifiers. ROCCH maximization problems have been taken as multiobjective optimization problem (MOPs) in some previous work. However, the special characteristics of ROCCH maximization problem makes it different from traditional MOPs. In this paper, the difference will be discussed in detail and a new convex hull-based multiobjective genetic programming (CH-MOGP) is proposed to solve ROCCH maximization problems. Specifically, convex hull-based without redundancy sorting (CWR-sorting) is introduced, which is an indicator-based selection scheme that aims to maximize the area under the convex hull. A novel selection procedure is also proposed based on the proposed sorting scheme. It is hypothesized that by using a tailored indicator-based selection, CH-MOGP becomes more efficient for ROC convex hull approximation than algorithms that compute all Pareto optimal points. Empirical studies are conducted to compare CH-MOGP to both existing machine learning approaches and multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) methods with classical selection schemes. Experimental results show that CH-MOGP outperforms the other approaches significantly.

Classification algorithms are the most commonly used machine learning modules that detect events of interest in these systems. The use of accurate and resource-efficient classification algorithms is of key importance because wearable nodes operate on limited resources on one hand and intend to recognize critical events (e.g., falls) on the other hand. These algorithms are used to map statistical features extracted from physiological signals onto different states such as health status of a patient or type of activity performed by a subject. Conventionally selected features may lead to rapid battery depletion, mainly due to the absence of computing complexity criterion while selecting prominent features. In this paper, we introduce the notion of power-aware feature selection, which aims at minimizing energy consumption of the data processing for classification applications such as action recognition. Our approach takes into consideration the energy cost of individual features that are calculated in real-time. A graph model is introduced to represent correlation and computing complexity of the features. The problem is formulated using integer programming and a greedy approximation is presented to select the features in a power-efficient manner. Experimental results on thirty channels of activity data collected from real subjects demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce energy consumption of the computing module, resulting in more than 30 percent energy savings while achieving 96.7 percent classification accuracy.

In this paper, autonomous robotic palpation with supervised machine learning algorithms enables mechanical localization and segmentation of stiff inclusions in artificial tissue. Elastography generates training data for the learning algorithms, providing a noninvasive, inclusion-specific characterization of tissue mechanics. Once an embedded hard inclusion was identified in the elastographic image, Gaussian discriminant analysis generated a classifier to threshold stiffness values acquired from autonomous robotic palpation. This classifier was later used to classify newly acquired points as either part of the inclusion or surrounding soft tissue. An expectation-maximization algorithm with underlying Markov random fields improved this initial classifier over successive iterations to better approximate the boundary of the inclusion. Results demonstrate robustness with respect to inclusion shape, size, and the initial classifier value. For three trials segmenting a cubic inclusion, sensitivity was above 0.95 and specificity was above 0.92.

For understanding the threat to security and privacy, it is important for security researchers to analyze malicious software written for these systems. The exploding number of Android malware calls for automation in the analysis. In this paper, we present Mobile-Sandbox, a system designed to automatically analyze Android applications in novel ways: First, it combines static and dynamic analysis, i.e., results of static analysis are used to guide dynamic analysis and extend coverage of executed code. Additionally, it uses specific techniques to log calls to native (i.e., "non-Java") APIs, and last but not least it combines these results with machine-learning techniques to cluster the analyzed samples into benign and malicious ones. We evaluated the system on more than 69,000 applications from Asian third-party mobile markets and found that about 21 % of them actually use native calls in their code.

Recognizing the intrinsic wickedness of traffic safety issues, such approach is used to unravel the complexity of traffic crash severity on highway corridors as an example of such problems. The support vector machine (SVM) and coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) algorithms are tested as inferential engines to predict crash severity and uncover spatial and non-spatial factors that systematically relate to crash severity, while a sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the relative influence of crash severity factors. Different specifications of the two methods are implemented, trained, and evaluated against crash events recorded over a 4-year period on a regional highway corridor in Northern Iran. Overall, the SVM model outperforms CANFIS by a notable margin. The combined use of spatial analysis and artificial intelligence is effective at identifying leading factors of crash severity, while explicitly accounting for spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity effects. Thanks to the demonstrated effectiveness of a sensitivity analysis, this approach produces comprehensive results that are consistent with existing traffic safety theories and supports the prioritization of effective safety measures that are geographically targeted and behaviorally sound on regional highway corridors.

Extraction of Retinal Blood Vessels and Diagnosis of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Using Extreme Learning Machine	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Diabetic Retinopathy; Blood Vessel Extraction; Matched Filter; Modified Local Entropy Thresholding; Support Vector Machine (SVM); Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)	DIGITAL FUNDUS IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	In medical field, wide varieties of applications can be dealt using Image processing. Detection and screening of retinal diseases is one such application in image processing. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes. The disease affects blood vessels inside the retina. Hence, in this work we have proposed a new method for extracting the retinal blood vessels from the color fundus images based on feature classification, to reduce the ophthalmologists' time for examining the retinal images. The blood vessels are extracted from the color fundus image by applying the preprocessing methods and segmentation techniques using matched filter and modified local entropy thresholding operation. The method was evaluated on the publicly available DRIVE and DIARETDB0 databases. In this paper, a recently developed machine learning algorithm called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used for diagnosing the Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. Performance of ELM is compared in terms of classification accuracy with Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier. It is observed that ELM leads to 97.5% average accuracy in comparison with SVM classifier (87.5%) for DIARETDB0 images.	[Bala, M.

Accordingly, the main contribution of this new procedure consists on classifying materials (wood) taking into account the mass loss rate and acceleration with respect to temperature. In our research, each TG curve is firstly smoothed using the local polynomial regression estimator, and the first, second, and third derivatives are estimated. The application of the local polynomial regression estimator provides a reliable way to obtain the TG derivatives, overcoming the noise problem in the TG derivative estimation. Then, using these estimated curves, the different wood classes are discriminated employing a nonparametric functional data analysis (NPFDA) technique, based on the Bayes rule and the Nadaraya-Watson regression estimator, and also novel functional generalized additive models (GAM). The latter allows to classify materials using simultaneously more than one type of thermal curves. The results are compared with those obtained using classical and machine learning multivariate supervised classification methods, such as Linear discriminant analysis, Quadratic classification, Na < ve Bayes, Logistic regression, Nearest neighbors, Neural networks, and Support vector machines. A regression model consisting of the mixture of the first derivatives of four generalized logistic components, one per principal wood constituent (water, hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin), is applied to fit the DTG curves. The resulting 16 parameters from this fit characterize each curve and are used as datasets to apply the multivariate supervised classification methods. The use of the TG derivatives jointly with the TG curves has proved to be an optimal discriminating feature, when the new functional GAM techniques are employed.

Since machine learning algorithms are generally used to build such detectors, one major challenge is adapting these techniques to battery-powered devices. Many recent works simply assume that on-platform detection is prohibitive and suggest using offloaded (i.e., cloud-based) engines. Such a strategy seeks to save battery life by exchanging computation and communication costs, but it still remains unclear whether this is optimal or not in all circumstances. In this paper, we evaluate different strategies for offloading certain functional tasks in machine learning based detection systems. Our experimental results confirm the intuition that outsourced computation is clearly the best option in terms of power consumption, outweighing on-platform strategies in, essentially, all practical scenarios. Our findings also point out noticeable differences among different machine learning algorithms, and we provide separate consumption models for functional blocks (data preprocessing, training, test, and communications) that can be used to obtain power consumption estimates and compare detectors.

The subsoil acidity is a limiting factor of the yield. Gypsum has been suggested when subsoil acidity limits the crops root growth, i.e., when the calcium (Ca) level is low and/or the aluminum (Al) level is toxic in the subsoil layers. However, there are doubts about the more efficient methods to estimate the gypsum requirement. This study was carried out to develop numerical models to estimate the gypsum requirement in soils under no-till system by the use of Machine Learning techniques. Computational analyses of the dataset were made applying the M5'Rules algorithm, based on regression models. The dataset comprised of soil chemical properties collected from experiments under no-till that received gypsum rates on the soil surface, throughout eight years after the application, in Southern Brazil. The results showed that the numerical models generated by rule induction M5'Rules algorithm were positively useful contributing for estimate the gypsum requirements under no-till. The models showed that Ca saturation in the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) was a more important attribute than Al saturation to estimate gypsum requirement in no-till soils.

However, the ATLS classification has limitations, namely, with regard to primary vital signs. This study identified the optimal variables for appropriate triage of hemorrhage severity, including the peripheral perfusion index and serum lactate concentration in addition to the conventional primary vital signs. To predict the four ATLS classes, three popular machine learning algorithms with four feature selection methods for multicategory classification were applied to a rat model of acute hemorrhage. A total of 78 anesthetized rats were divided into four groups for ATLS classification based on blood loss (in percent). The support vector machine one-versus-one model with the Kruskal-Wallis feature selection method performed best, with 80.8% accuracy, relative classifier information of 0.629, and a kappa index of 0.732. The new hemorrhage-induced severity index (lactate concentration/perfusion index), diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and the perfusion index were selected as the optimal variables for predicting the four ATLS classes by support vector machine one-versus-one with the Kruskal-Wallis method. These four variables were also selected for binary classification to predict ATLS classes I and II versus III and IV for blood transfusion requirement. The suggested ATLS classification system would be helpful to first responders by indicating the severity of patients, allowing physicians to prepare suitable resuscitation before hospital arrival, which could hasten treatment initiation.

Diseases caused by Pectobacterium are controlled mainly through use of healthy planting material, sanitation and copper sprays. Environmental factors, such as temperature, moisture and soil oxygen concentration, have a large effect on development of diseases caused by Pectobacterium and disease incidence can be unpredictable. The pathogen is spread by various mechanisms including water, seed, equipment and insects. Little is understood about plant resistance to soft rot bacterial pathogens and no commercial potato cultivars are resistant to soft rot, although some have tolerance and some wild potato species are resistant. Pectobacterium is a diverse genus, with multiple species capable of infecting potato. Multiple Pectobacterium species may be found in the same field and even on the same plant. Pectobacterium strains vary in aggressiveness and the virulence genes they encode but there are many commonalities across the genus. Over the past decade, genomic studies have provided new insights into Pectobacterium biology. For example, some Pectobacterium strains may elicit plant cell death to promote disease in leaves. Strains of the pathogen also produce an orange pigment and volatile compounds that increase virulence and that may act as insect kairomones. Recent work with a supervised machine learning program has identified several novel target genes likely to contribute to plant-microbe interactions, suggesting that there is still much to learn about how soft rot bacteria cause disease.

A novel image analysis routine, based on a supervised machine learning strategy, is used to identify agglomerates that are subsequently characterized by their volume. Through repeated measurement of a large number of agglomerates, a 1D particle size distribution of agglomerates is reconstructed. Concurrently, established tools are used to characterize needle-like primary crystals, whose shape is described by cylinders and whose population can be described by a separate two-dimensional particle size and shape distribution. The performance of the classifier is evaluated, and the reproducibility of the measurement is demonstrated for the case of beta l-glutamic acid. For the same system, the agglomeration behavior is studied for varying operating conditions, and general trends are analyzed.

In order to improve the limited scope of many methods based on a kinematic or surface mesh model, we propose a spatiotemporal segmentation of keypoints provided by a skeletonization of depth contours. A vector-shaped pose descriptor allows for the retrieval of similar poses and is easier to use with many machine learning libraries. A visualization method based on the Hilbert curve provides valuable insight in the detected poses. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is able to adapt to the number of people in a kitchen scenario, and track them over time. We were able to retrieve similar poses from a database and identify clusters in the dataset. By applying our method, the Princeton Tracking Benchmark, we demonstrated that our method is applicable in scenes where a human kinematic or surface mesh model would be overly restrictive.

Specifically, we discuss how a cognitive engine (CE) can be potentially standardized, and we offer our latest innovations on metacognitive engine (meta-CE) design. The intelligent techniques of a CR are implemented in an agent commonly referred to as a CE. A CE manages the CR's operation. Typically, a CE is based on a primary learning and optimization algorithm that is utilized within the CE. Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and deficiencies depending on the operating scenario that makes some of them more appropriate for specific operating conditions. A meta-CE is an engine that learns which CE is more appropriate to provide the adaptation needed for the operating conditions. To make a meta-CE possible, first, we need a method for characterizing the CE algorithm's performance. Second, we should classify the operating conditions based on the CE algorithm's characteristics in order to determine the most appropriate operating condition. Our results show that, when we use meta-CE techniques, we have about 30% increase in performance compared with using the best individual CE.
