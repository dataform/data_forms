J	Datta, S; Datta, S				Datta, Susmita; Datta, Somnath			Evaluation of clustering algorithms for gene expression data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium of Computations in Bioinformatics and Bioscience in Conjunction with the International Multi-Symposium on Computer and Computational Sciences	JUN 20-24, 2006	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA				VALIDATION	Background: Cluster analysis is an integral part of high dimensional data analysis. In the context of large scale gene expression data, a filtered set of genes are grouped together according to their expression profiles using one of numerous clustering algorithms that exist in the statistics and machine learning literature. A closely related problem is that of selecting a clustering algorithm that is "optimal" in some sense from a rather impressive list of clustering algorithms that currently exist. Results: In this paper, we propose two validation measures each with two parts: one measuring the statistical consistency (stability) of the clusters produced and the other representing their biological functional congruence. Smaller values of these indices indicate better performance for a clustering algorithm. We illustrate this approach using two case studies with publicly available gene expression data sets: one involving a SAGE data of breast cancer patients and the other involving a time course cDNA microarray data on yeast. Six well known clustering algorithms UPGMA, K-Means, Diana, Fanny, Model-Based and SOM were evaluated. Conclusion: No single clustering algorithm may be best suited for clustering genes into functional groups via expression profiles for all data sets. The validation measures introduced in this paper can aid in the selection of an optimal algorithm, for a given data set, from a collection of available clustering algorithms.

They have many irregularities and sometimes appear in ambiguous contexts. In recent years, machine-learning (ML) approaches have become increasingly common and now represent the cutting edge of Bio-NER technology. This paper addresses three problems faced by ML-based Bio-NER systems. First, most ML approaches usually employ singleton features that comprise one linguistic property (e. g., the current word is capitalized) and at least one class tag (e. g., B-protein, the beginning of a protein name). However, such features may be insufficient in cases where multiple properties must be considered. Adding conjunction features that contain multiple properties can be beneficial, but it would be infeasible to include all conjunction features in an NER model since memory resources are limited and some features are ineffective. To resolve the problem, we use a sequential forward search algorithm to select an effective set of features. Second, variations in the numerical parts of biomedical terms (e.g., "2" in the biomedical term IL2) cause data sparseness and generate many redundant features. In this case, we apply numerical normalization, which solves the problem by replacing all numerals in a term with one representative numeral to help classify named entities. Third, the assignment of NE tags does not depend solely on the target word's closest neighbors, but may depend on words outside the context window (e.g., a context window of five consists of the current word plus two preceding and two subsequent words). We use global patterns generated by the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm to identify such structures and modify the results of our ML-based tagger. This is called pattern-based post-processing. Results: To develop our ML-based Bio-NER system, we employ conditional random fields, which have performed effectively in several well-known tasks, as our underlying ML model. Adding selected conjunction features, applying numerical normalization, and employing pattern-based post-processing improve the F-scores by 1.67%, 1.04%, and 0.57%, respectively. The combined increase of 3.28% yields a total score of 72.98%, which is better than the baseline system that only uses singleton features. Conclusion: We demonstrate the benefits of using the sequential forward search algorithm to select effective conjunction feature groups. In addition, we show that numerical normalization can effectively reduce the number of redundant and unseen features. Furthermore, the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm can help ML-based Bio-NER deal with difficult cases that need longer context windows.

Proper analysis of these execution logs can yield important knowledge that can help organizations to improve the quality of their services. Starting from a process model, which can be discovered by conventional process mining algorithms, we analyze how data attributes influence the choices made in the process based on past process executions. Decision mining, also referred to as decision point analysis, aims at the detection of data dependencies that affect the routing of a case. In this paper we describe how machine learning techniques can be leveraged for this purpose, and we present a Decision Miner implemented within the ProM framework.

However, the majority of AI approaches used lead to predefined and predictable computer controlled character behaviours, with no capability to learn from the behaviour or playing style of the player. The incorporation of real-time machine learning techniques is vital to the digital games industry in order to improve the reactive behaviours of computer controlled characters and to tailor game-play to the individual player. Nonetheless, the use of real-time learning raises a number of issues and concerns for game design and development. In this paper we outline a set of guidelines that may be applied during the evaluation of machine learning techniques to be used for real-time learning within digital games.

Using machine learning to focus iterative optimization	CGO 2006: 4th International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization	MAR 26-29, 2006	New York, NY	IEEE Comp Soc, TC-uARCH, ACM SIGPLAN, ACM SIGMICRO				Iterative compiler optimization has been shown to outperform static approaches. This, however is at the cost of large numbers of evaluations of the program. This paper develops a new methodology to reduce this number and hence speed up iterative optimization. It uses predictive modelling from the domain of machine learning to automatically focus search on those areas likely to give greatest performance. This approach is independent of search algorithm, search space or compiler infrastructure and scales gracefully with the compiler optimization space size. Off-line, a training set of programs is iteratively evaluated and the shape of the spaces and program features are modelled These models are learnt and used to focus the iterative optimization of a new program. We evaluate two learnt models, an independent and Markov model, and evaluate their worth on two embedded platforms, the Texas Instrument C6713 and the AMD Au1500. We show that such learnt models can speed up iterative search on large spaces by an order of magnitude. This translates into an average speedup of 1.22 on the TI C6713 and 1.27 on the AMD Au1500 in just 2 evaluations.

Pressure fluctuations time series data obtained at different operating conditions were first analyzed to obtain the distribution of local Holder exponents' estimates. The relevant features from this distribution were then used as input data to the SVM classifier. Employing this method we could classify flow regimes with 98% accuracy. The results highlight the fact that the local scaling behavior of a given regime follows a distinct pattern. Further, the singularity features can be employed by intelligent machine learning based algorithms like SVM for successful online regime identification. The method can be readily applied to the other multiphase systems like bubble column, fluidized bed, etc. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The goal of machine learning algorithms is to learn an objective function from a set of training examples where each example is defined by a feature set. Regularly, real word applications have many examples with many features; however, the objective function depends on few of them. The presence of noisy examples or irrelevant features in a dataset degrades the performance of machine learning algorithms; such is the case of k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm (k-NN). Thus choosing good instance and feature subsets may improve the algorithm's performance. Evolutionary algorithms proved to be good techniques for finding solutions in a large solution space and to be stable in the presence of noise. In this work, we address the problem of instance selection and feature weighting for instance-based methods by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution strategies (ES). We show that combining GA and ES with a k-NN algorithm can improve the predictive accuracy of the resulting classifier.

Stochastic dynamic production control by neurodynamic programming	CIRP ANNALS-MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	56th General Assembly of CIRP	AUG 20-26, 2006	Kobe, JAPAN			production control; machine learning; neurodynamic programming	SCHEDULING PROBLEM	The paper proposes Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to model production control systems that work in uncertain and changing environments. In an MDP finding an optimal control policy can be traced back to computing the optimal value function, which is the unique solution of the Bellman equation. Reinforcement learning methods, such as Q-learning, can be used for estimating this function; however, the value estimations are often only available for a few states of the environment, typically generated by simulation. The paper suggests the application of a new type of support vector regression model, called v-SVR, which can effectively fit a smooth function to the available data and allow good generalization properties. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by experimental results on both benchmark and industry related data.

Linear classifiers then are optimized to give the maximal margin separation between the classes. This task is performed by solving some type of mathematical programming such as quadratic programming (QP) or linear programming (LP). On the other hand. from a viewpoint of mathematical programming for machine learning, the idea of maximal margin separation was employed in the multi-surface method (MSM) suggested by Mangasarian in 1960's. Also. linear classifiers using goal programming were developed extensively in 1980's The authors have developed several varieties of SVM using multi-objective programming and goal programming (MOP/GP) techniques. This paper extends the family of SVM for classification to regression. and discusses their characteristics and abilities through numerical experiments in engineering design problems.

Analyze the relations on the model. Note the Universal Property of free semigroups for Word Monoids. Conclude by a practical example that the word class and the word order are two stable elements during language transferring. Because that the word class and the word order are two parts of phrase structure, the phrase structure is the feature of language style. We can apply Natural Language Processing method to get the feature of language style, automatically by phrase structure identification and phrase structure probabilities counting. Thus establish a foundation for further Machine Learning.

To address data sparseness, we used temporal reasoning as an over-sampling method to dramatically expand the amount of training data, resulting in predictive accuracy on link labeling as high as 93% using a Maximum Entropy classifier on human annotated data. This method compared favorably against a series of increasingly sophisticated baselines involving expansion of rules derived from human intuitions.

Current approaches often employ machine learning techniques and require supervised data. However, many languages lack such resources. This paper presents an (almost) unsupervised learning algorithm for automatic discovery of Named Entities (NEs) in a resource free language, given a bilingual corpora in which it is weakly temporally aligned with a resource rich language. NEs have similar time distributions across such corpora, and often some of the tokens in a multi-word NE are transliterated. We develop an algorithm that exploits both observations iteratively. The algorithm makes use of a new, frequency based, metric for time distributions and a resource free discriminative approach to transliteration. Seeded with a small number of transliteration pairs, our algorithm discovers multi-word NEs, and takes advantage of a dictionary (if one exists) to account for translated or partially translated NEs. We evaluate the algorithm on an English-Russian corpus, and show high level of NEs discovery in Russian.

It takes into account two kinds of information not considered in previous statistical (machine learning based) parsing methods: information about dependency relations among the case elements of a verb, and information about co-occurrence relations between a verb and its case element. This information can be collected from the results of automatic dependency parsing of large-scale corpora. The results of an experiment in which our method was used to rerank the results obtained using an existing machine learning based parsing method showed that our method can improve the accuracy of the results obtained using the existing method.

In this paper, we describe the task of predicting Japanese case markers and propose machine learning methods for solving it in two settings: (i) monolingual, when given information only from the Japanese sentence; and (ii) bilingual, when also given information from a corresponding English source sentence in an MT context. We formulate the task after the well-studied task of English semantic role labelling, and explore features from a syntactic dependency structure of the sentence. For the monolingual task, we evaluated our models on the Kyoto Corpus and achieved over 84% accuracy in assigning correct case markers for each phrase. For the bilingual task, we achieved an accuracy of 92% per phrase using a bilingual dataset from a technical domain. We show that in both settings, features that exploit dependency information, whether derived from gold-standard annotations or automatically assigned, contribute significantly to the prediction of case markers.

However, multiclass classification is more commonly encountered in identifying tumor subtypes using MGED. Using MGED, Dudoit et al. (2002) showed that diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA) outperformed other linear and quadratic discriminants, nearest neighbor, and classification trees with univariate splits. It is of interest, therefore, to compare performance of SVMs to DLDA and the latest two classification trees with linear splits, which performered better than trees with univariate splits, in multiclass classification of MGED. Furthermore, the performance of SVMs with different types of kernels were studied by three types of multiclass MGED. Finally, we investigate how irrelevant and correlated variables (features) influence the performance of the three classifiers. Some suggestions are made for multiclass classification of MGED.

COMPILER CONSTRUCTION, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Compiler Construction	MAR 30-31, 2006	Vienna, AUSTRIA				REGISTER ALLOCATION	We introduce a new class of compiler heuristics: hybrid optimizations. Hybrid optimizations choose dynamically at compile time which optimization algorithm to apply from a set of different algorithms that implement the same optimization. They use a heuristic to predict the most appropriate algorithm for each piece of code being optimized. Specifically, we construct a hybrid register allocator that chooses between linear scan and graph coloring register allocation. Linear scan is more efficient, but sometimes less effective; graph coloring is generally more expensive, but sometimes more effective. Our setting is Java JIT compilation, which makes optimization algorithm efficiency particularly important. Our hybrid allocator decides, based on features of a method, which algorithm to apply to that method. We used supervised learning to induce the decision heuristic. We evalute our technique within Jikes RVM [1] and show on average it outperforms graph coloring by 9% and linear scan by 3% for a typical compilation scenario. To our knowledge, this is the first time anyone has used heuristics induced by machine learning to select between different optimization algorithms.

To cope with this problem, fault feature selection based on rough set method is proposed. It emphasizes the role of the basic constructs of rough set approach in feature subset selection, namely reductions and their approximations. To find the optimal fault state feature subsets is the aim of feature selection. Rough sets theory provides a mathematical approach to find optimal feature subset, but this approach is time consuming. In this paper, a novel heuristic searching algorithm based on rough sets to find out the feature subset is proposed. Rolling bearing data analysis results show in most times our algorithm can find out optimal feature subset quickly and efficiently.

In medical diagnostic tasks, the human observer plays the role of the decision-maker, forming opinions based on visual assessment of images. In content-based image retrieval, the human user is the ultimate judge of the relevance of images recalled from a database. We argue that data collected from human observers should be used in conjunction with machine-learning algorithms to model and optimize performance in tasks that involve humans. In essence, we treat the human observer as a nonlinear system to be identified. In this paper, we review our work in two applications of this general idea. In the first, a learning machine is trained to predict the accuracy of human observers in a lesion detection task for purposes of assessing image quality. In the second, a learning machine is trained to predict human users' perception of the similarity of two images for purposes of content-based image retrieval from a database. In both examples, it is shown that a nonlinear learning machine can accurately identify the nonlinear human system that maps images into numerical values, such as detection performance or image similarity.

In this paper, a novel supervised feature extraction algorithm based on continuous divergence criterion (CDC) is set up. Firstly, the concept of the CDC is given, and some properties of the CDC are studied, and proved that CDC here is a kind of distance measure, i.e. it satisfies three requests of distance axiomatization, which can be used to measure the difference degree of a two-class problem. Secondly, based on CDC, the basic principle of supervised feature extraction are studied, a new concept of accumulated information rate (AIR) is given, which can be used to measure the degree of feature compression for two-class, and a new supervised feature extraction algorithm is constructed. At last, the experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm here is valid and reliable.

The SVMs have become an increasingly popular tool for machine learning tasks involving classification, regression or novelty detection. The Emotion Recognition System will be recognise emotion from the sentence that was inputted from the keyboard. The training set and testing set were constructed to verify the effect of this model. Experiments showed that this method could achieve better results in practice. The result showed that this method has potential in the emotion recognition field.

A deterministic crowding genetic algorithm is used for obtaining different subsets of features that provide high performance classification in a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. These subsets of features are then used as training data in a rule generator based on fuzzy clustering to obtain a performance qualitative model that can give information about the more suitable features to use in the diagnosis. This model can also be used to assess the (performance) accuracy that will be reached by using a given set of features - possible those ones available at a specific medical centre. The overall methodology is applied to Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) - the heart arrhythmia that causes more frequently cerebrovascular incidents - Diagnosis based on analysis of nonfibrillation ECGs.

Incremental learning training set examples distribute over time, maintaining examples one by one. This paper describes partial instance memory incremental learning algorithm FLORA2 - algorithm for supervised learning of concepts that are subject to concept drift. The algorithm FLORA2 uses a special feature for keeping a subset of examples in memory - a window. In length of time new examples are being added to the window while others are considered outdated and are forgotten. In this paper incremental learning algorithm FLORA 2 with dynamic window size is applied in e-mail classification task. An e-mail classification task is the junk e-mail problem solving task. Active e-mail user receives thousands of messages each month. Separating the good messages from the junk using artificial intelligence algorithm decreases the time what users spending for managing their inboxes.

The descriptions are represented by means of relational features, extracted from gene ontology information, and are straightforwardly interpretable by the medical experts. We applied the proposed method to two known data sets: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) vs. acute myeloid leukemia and classification of fourteen types of cancer. Significant number of discovered groups of genes had a description, confirmed by the medical expert, which highlighted the underlying biological process that is responsible for distinguishing one class from the other classes. We view our methodology not just as a prototypical example of applying sophisticated machine learning algorithms to microarray data, but also as a motivation for developing more sophisticated functional annotations and ontologies, that can be processed by such learning algorithms.

Assessment is based on an empirical approach: manually tagged data from a spoken-dialogue and video corpus are used in a CART-style machine learning algorithm to produce a predictive model. Our approach involves two general stages: the tagging task, and the development of machine learning experiments. In the first stage, human annotators produce dialogue act taggings using a formal methodology, obtaining a highly enough tagging agreement, measured with Kappa statistics. In the second stage, tagging data are used to generate decision trees. Preliminary results show that intonation information is useful to recognize sentence mood, and sentence mood and utterance duration data contribute to recognize dialogue act. Precision, recall and Kappa values of the predictive model are promising. Our model can contribute to improve automatic speech recognition or dialogue management systems.

To achieve this aim, web-tables must be converted into a machine readable form, an attribute-value pair, the relation of which is similar to that of head-body. We have separated meaningful tables and decorative tables in our previous work, because web-tables are used for the purpose of knowledge structuring as well as document design, and only meaningful tables can be used to extract information. In order to extract the semantic relations existing between language contents in a meaningful table, this study separated the head from the body in meaningful tables using machine learning. We (a) established features observing the editing habit of authors and tables themselves, and (b) established a model using machine learning algorithm, C4.5 in order to separate the head from the body. We obtained 86.2% accuracy in extracting the head from the meaningful tables.

This paper organizes the search space for concepts as a prefix tree, and employs a new data structure called Attribute Table to map and prune the tree. Thus, the procedures of conceptual clustering can be carried out only in a few valid subspaces. A fast algorithm for generating concepts is proposed in this paper. Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm performs very well for generating concepts on both dense and sparse contexts.

The arguments for specific examples are a special form of experts knowledge which the expert uses to substantiate the class value for the chosen example. Mozina et al. developed the ABCN2 algorithm - an extension of the well known rule learning in algorithm CN2 - that can use argumented examples in the learning process. In this work we present an application of ABCN2 in the medical domain which deals with severe bacterial infections in geriatric population. The elderly population, people over 65 years of age is rapidly growing as well as the costs of treating this population. In our study, we compare ABCN2 to CN2 and show that using arguments we improve the characteristics of the model. We also report the results that C4.5, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression achieve in this domain.

Combinations (parallel and cascade) of the two systems were also tested. The usefulness of syllable information is also investigated. Systems with good performance were obtained both using a single self-learning method and combinations. Best performance was obtained with MBL and the parallel combination. The use of syllable information contributes to a better performance in all systems tested.

However, some information, such as adult content, is not appropriate for all users, notably children. Additionally for adults, some contents included in abnormal porn sites can do ordinary people's mental health harm. In this paper, we propose an efficient 2-way text filter for blocking harmful web documents and also present a new criterion for clear classification. It filters off 0-grade web texts containing no harmful words using pattern matching with harmful words dictionaries, and classifies 1-grade, 2-grade and 3-grade web texts using a machine learning algorithm.

The algorithm is based on a Producer-Scrounger model of animal behaviour, which assumes group members search either for 'finding' (producer) or for 'joining' (scrounger) opportunities. Animal scanning mechanisms (e.g., vision) are incorporated to develop the algorithm. In this paper, we apply the GSO to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training to further investigate its applicability to real-world problems. The parameters of a 3-layer feed-forward ANN, including connection weights and bias are tuned by the GSO algorithm. Two real-world classification problems have been employed as benchmark problems trained by the ANN, to assess the performance of the GSO-trained ANN (GSOANN). In comparison with other sophisticated machine learning techniques proposed for ANN training in recent years, including some ANN ensembles, GSOANN has a better convergence and generalization performances on the two benchmark problems.

They can be used if a large set of pre-sampled training set is available and the domain does not change rapidly. However, it is not easy to get a complete trained data set in the real world. Furthermore, the classification knowledge continually changes in different situations. This is known as the maintenance problem or knowledge acquisition bottleneck problem. Multiple Classification Ripple-Down Rules (MCRDR), an incremental knowledge acquisition method, was introduced to resolve this problem and has been applied in several commercial expert systems and a document classification system. Evaluation results for several domains show that our MCRDR based document classification method can be successfully applied in the real world document classification task.

SVMs can handle nonlinear classification by implicitly mapping input samples from the input feature space into another high dimensional feature space with a nonlinear kernel function. However, SVMs are not favorable for huge datasets with over millions of samples. Granular computing decomposes information in the form of some aggregates and solves the targeted problems in each granule. Therefore, we propose a novel computational model called Clustering Support Vector Machines (CSVMs) to deal with the complex classification problems for huge datasets. Taking advantage of both theory of granular computing and advanced statistical learning methodology, CSVMs are built specifically for each information granule partitioned intelligently by the clustering algorithm. This feature makes learning tasks for each CSVMs more specific and simpler. Moreover, CSVMs built particularly for each granule can be easily parallelized so that CSVMs can be used to handle huge datasets efficiently. The CSVMs model is used for predicting local protein tertiary structure. Compared with the conventional clustering method, the prediction accuracy for local protein tertiary structure has been improved noticeably when the new CSVM model is used.

An MILP model for multi-class data classification	Computer Aided Methods in Optimal Design and Operations	SERIES ON COMPUTERS AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH		English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Optimal Process Design	FEB 15-17, 2006	Vilnius, LITHUANIA			data classification; MILP; hyper-boxes; multiple classes	DEA-DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS; MATHEMATICAL-PROGRAMMING MODELS; FORMULATIONS	This paper presents a multi-class data classification approach based on hyper-boxes using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Comparing with other discriminant classifiers, hyper-boxes are adopted to capture the disjoint regions and define the boundaries of each class so as to minimise the total misclassified samples. Non-overlapping constraints are specified to avoid overlapping of boxes that belong to different classes. In order to improve the training and testing accuracy, an iterative solution approach is presented to assign multi-boxes to single class. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through two illustrative examples from machine learning databases. According to the computational results, our approach is competitive in terms of prediction accuracy when comparing with various standard classifiers.

GPA improves on other decision list algorithms by introducing a new objective function for rule selection and a set of novel search algorithms that allow application to large scale real world problems. GPA achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the protein secondary structure prediction problem in bioinformatics and the English part of speech tagging problem in computational linguistics. For both domains GPA produces a rule set that human experts find easy to interpret, a marked advantage in decision support environments. In addition, we compare GPA to other decision list induction algorithms as well as support vector machines, C4.5, naive Bayes, and a nearest neighbor method on a number of standard data sets from the UCI machine learning repository.

Although thousands of GPCR sequences are known, many of them are orphan sequences (the activating ligand is unknown). Therefore, classification methods for automated characterization of orphan GPCRs are imperative. In this study, for predicting Level 1 subfamilies of GPCRs, a novel method for obtaining class specific features, based on the existence of activating ligand specific patterns, has been developed and utilized for a majority voting classification. Exploiting the fact that there is a non-promiscuous relationship between the specific binding of GPCRs into their ligands and their functional classification, our method classifies Level 1 subfamilies of GPCRs with a high predictive accuracy between 99% and 87% in a three-fold cross validation test. The method also tells us which motifs are significant for class determination which has important design implications. ne presented machine learning approach, bridges the gulf between the excess amount of GPCR sequence data and their poor functional characterization.

In this study, we have presented an intelligent identification system that is designed to identify the sex of a person in a Turkish chat medium. To do this task, a target oriented chat agent is implemented. A simple discrimination function is proposed for sex identification. The system also uses a semantic analysis method to determine the sex of the chatters. Here, the sex identification is taken as an example in the information extraction in chat mediums. This proposed identification system employs the agent and acquires data from a chat medium, and then automatically detects the chatter's sex from the information exchanged between the agent and chatter. The system has achieved accuracy about 90% in the sex identification in a real chat medium.

The contributions of the paper include a novel means of regularising multi-scale compactly supported basis functions that leads to the desirable interpolation properties previously only associated with fully supported bases. We also provide a regularisation framework for simpler and more direct treatment of surface normals, along with a corresponding generalisation of the representer theorem lying at the core of kernel-based machine learning methods. We demonstrate the techniques on 3D problems of up to 14 million data points, as well as 4D time series data and four-dimensional interpolation between three-dimensional shapes.

In our previous work, as a prerequisite for information extraction from tables in HTML, algorithms for separating meaningful tables and decorative tables were constructed, because only meaningful tables can be used to extract information and a preponderant proportion of decorative tables in training harms the learning result. In order to extract information, this study separated the head from the body in meaningful tables by extending the head extraction algorithm that was constructed in our previous work, using a machine learning algorithm, C4.5, and set up heuristics for table-schema extraction from meaningful tables by analyzing their head(s). In addition, table information in triples was extracted by determining the relation between the data and the extracted table schema. We obtained 71.2% accuracy in extracting table-schemata and information from the meaningful tables.

The misuse in word form was checked by constructing a list of expressions whose word form is bad in terms of honorifics. The misuse in performance was checked by constructing a consistency table. The consistency table defined the consistency between the honorific features of sentences and the social relationship among the people involved in the sentence. The social relationship was represented by combinations of [the number of people involved in the sentence] X [relative social position among the people] x [in-group/out-group relationship among the people). The consistency table was obtained by using a machine learning technique. The proposed system was verified using test data prepared by the authors and also by third-party linguistic researchers. The results showed that the system was able to discriminate between the correct and the incorrect honorific sentences in all but a few cases. Furthermore, differences in the educational importance among the norms used in the system were revealed based on experiments using sentences written by people who are not linguistic experts.

This is particularly true for the emerging class of systems known as systems of systems, as they are composed of many distributed, heterogenous and autonomous components. Performing hazard analysis on such systems is challenging, in part because it is difficult to know in advance which of the many observable or measurable features of the system are important for maintaining system safety. Hence there is a need for effective techniques to find causal relationships within these systems. This paper explores the use of machine learning techniques to extract potential causal relationships from simulation models. This is illustrated with a case study of a military system of systems.

We propose a new approach based on machine learning. First, many features reflecting road characteristics are extracted, which consist of the ratio of bright regions, the direction consistency of edges and local binary patterns. Then these features are input into a learning container, and AdaBoost is adopted to train classifiers and select most effective features. Finally, roads are detected with a sliding window by using the learning results and validated by combining the road connectivity. Experimental results on real Quick-bird images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

Our approach is based on region growing using fast marching level set method (FMLSM), and machine learning for automatically tuning its parameters. FMLSM is used to extract the shape of objects in images. Parameters are introduced into the speed function of the FMLSM to improve flexibility and reflect the variety of images. The parameters are tuned using machine learning and utilizing background knowledge. The primary contribution of our approach is the ability to learn the parameters for a FMLSM model for object extraction. Experimental results on 11 HRRS image datasets, 1024*1024 pixels each with ground resolution of 1.3 meters, demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm. We are able to extract the roads without the use of heuristic parameters and other.,manual intervention.

Those methods are robust. They require an important processing power and a high memory bandwidth which becomes a handicap for real-time applications. The recent evolution of commodity PC computer graphics boards (CPU) has the potential to accelerate those algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel use of graphics hardware for object detection in advanced computer vision applications. We implement a system for object-detection based on AdaBoost [1]. This system can be tuned to run partially or totally on the CPU. This system is evaluated with two face-detection applications. Those applications are based on the boosted cascade of classifiers: Multiple Layers Face Detection (MLFD), and Single Layer Face Detection (SLFD). We show that the SLFD implementation on CPU performs up to nine times faster than its CPU counterpart. The MLFD, in the other hand, can be accelerated using the CPU and performs up to three times faster than the CPU. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to implement a sliding window technique for visual object-detection on CPU, with promessing performance.

In this paper we investigate the performance of several state-of-the-art machine-learning methods on a CAD method for detecting prostatic adenocarcinoma from high resolution (4 Tesla) ex vivo MRI studies. A total of 14 different feature ensemble methods from 4 different families of ensemble methods were compared: Bayesian learning, Boosting, Bagging, and the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. Quantitative comparison of the methods was done on a total of 33 2D sections obtained from 5 different 3D MRI prostate studies. The tumor ground truth was determined on histologic sections and the regions manually mapped onto the corresponding individual MRI slices. All methods considered were found to be robust to changes in parameter settings and showed significantly less classification variability compared to inter-observer agreement among 5 experts. The kNN classifier was the best in terms of accuracy and ease of training, thus validating the principle of Occam's Razor. The success of a simple non-parametric classifier requiring minimal training is significant for medical image analysis applications where large amounts of training data are usually unavailable.

Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7% of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120%) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300%) can operate at full frame rate. Clearly a high-speed detector is of limited use if the features produced are unsuitable for downstream processing. In particular, the same scene viewed from two different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations[1]. Hence the second contribution of this paper is a comparison corner detectors based on this criterion applied to 3D scenes. This comparison supports a number of claims made elsewhere concerning existing corner detectors.

Judging beauty and other aesthetic qualities of photographs is a highly subjective task. Hence, there is no unanimously agreed standard for measuring aesthetic value. In spite of the lack of firm rules, certain features in photographic images are believed, by many, to please humans more than certain others. In this paper, we treat the challenge of automatically inferring aesthetic quality of pictures using their visual content as a machine learning problem, with a peer-rated online photo sharing Website as data source. We extract certain visual features based on the intuition that they can discriminate between aesthetically pleasing and displeasing images. Automated classifiers are built using support vector machines and classification trees. Linear regression on polynomial terms of the features is also applied to infer numerical aesthetics ratings. The work attempts to explore the relationship between emotions which pictures arouse in people, and their low-level content. Potential applications include content-based image retrieval and digital photography.

In the previous approaches [1, 2], an optimal similarity transformation is exhaustively searched for to maximize the response of a trained classification model. At best, these approaches only give a rough estimate of the position of a non-rigid shape. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning based approach to achieve a refined shape detection result. We train a model that has the largest response on a reference shape and a smaller response on other shapes. During shape detection, we search for an optimal non-rigid deformation to maximize the response of the trained model on the deformed image block. Since exhaustive searching is inapplicable for a non-rigid deformation space with a high dimension, currently, example based searching is used instead. Experiments on two applications, left ventricle endocardial border detection and facial feature detection, demonstrate the robustness of our approach. It outperforms the well-known ASM and AAM approaches on challenging samples.

It is one of determining whether a questioned signature matches known signature samples. From the viewpoint of automating the task it can be viewed as one that involves machine learning from a population of signatures. There are two types of learning to be accomplished. In the first, the training set consists of genuines and forgeries from a general population. In the second there are genuine signatures in a given case. The two learning tasks are called person-independent (or general) learning and person-dependent (or special) learning. General learning is from a population of genuine and forged signatures of several individuals, where the differences between genuines and forgeries across all individuals are learnt. The general learning model allows a questioned signature to be compared to a single genuine signature. In special learning, a person's signature is learnt from multiple samples of only that person's signature-where within-person similarities are learnt. When a sufficient number of samples are available, special learning performs better than general learning (5% higher accuracy). With special learning, verification accuracy increases with the number of samples.

The kernel ridge regression is one of simple and classical kernel machines and it gives a foundation for other kernel machines such as the support vector machine. However, it has some problems such as arbitrariness of the model and theoretical validity of an ad hoc kernelization of the ridge regression. The essence of using a kernel in learning problems is that the unknown target is representable by a function belonging to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space corresponding to the adopted kernel. In this paper, on the basis of the essence, we give two identical interpretations, whose theoretical grounds are clarified, for the kernel ridge regression. One is the ridge regression on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and the other is the parametric projection learning with a specific condition.

There are many ways how a citation might fit into the overall argumentation of the article: as part of the solution, as rival approach or as flawed approach that justifies the current research. Our motivation for this work is to improve citation indexing. The method we use for this task is machine learning from indicators of affect (such as "we follow X in assuming that... ", or "in contrast to Y, our system solves this problem") and of presentation of ownership of ideas (such as "We present a new methodfor... ", or "They claim that... "). Some of these features are borrowed from Argumentative Zoning (Teufel and Moens, 2002), a technique for determining the rhetorical status of each sentence in a scientific article. These features include the type of subject of the sentence, the citation type, the semantic class of main verb, and a list of indicator phrases.

For this task, it is important to automatically determine the rhetorical/argumentative status of a given sentence in the text. On the basis of this information, users can be advised that a different sentence order might be more advantageous or that certain argumentative moves are missing. In implementing such a system, we had to port AZ from English to Portuguese, as our system is designed to help the writing of Brazilian PhD theses in Computer Science. In this chapter, we report on the overall system, named SciPo, the porting exercise, including a human annotation experiment to verify the reproducibility of our annotation scheme, and the intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the AZ module of the system.

The two elementary components of this approach are a shallow NLP polar language extraction system and a machine learning based topic classifier. These components are composed together by making a simple but accurate collocation assumption: if a topical sentence contains polar language, the polarity is associated with the topic. We evaluate our system, components and assumption on a corpus of online consumer messages. Based on these components, we discuss how to measure the overall sentiment about a particular topic as expressed in online messages authored by many different people. We propose to use the fundamentals of Bayesian statistics to form an aggregate authorial opinion metric. This metric would propagate uncertainties introduced by the polarity and topic modules to facilitate statistically valid comparisons of opinion across multiple topics.

In this paper, the impact of lexical feature selection and feature generalization, applied to reviews, on the precision of two probabilistic classifiers (Naive Bayes and Markov Model) with respect to OvOP identification is observed. Feature generalization based on hypernymy as provided by WordNet, and feature selection based on part-of-speech (POS) tags are evaluated. A ranking criterion is introduced, based on a function of the probability of having positive or negative polarity, which makes it possible to achieve 100% precision with 10% recall. Movie reviews are used for training and testing the probabilistic classifiers, which achieve 80% precision.

Several mathematical models of segregation have been developed in previous works; all of them develop some equations to modelize segregation behavior. In this work it is intended to develop a model based on neural networks obtaining a deeper knowledge on this phenomenon. The first trials have been done with a variable selection based on the experience and previous knowledge on segregation. Further studies will include new variable selection and trials with other machine learning techniques such as genetic programming.

This is not a trivial generalisation as the probability density used for the finite dimensional case does not exist. It is shown how the logarithmic gradient can be used to characterise stationary points for the Gaussian process prior case. A nonconforming finite element method is suggested using sparse grids to solve the resulting variational problem.

Virtual screening should not be restricted to optimize binding affinity and improve selectivity; and the pharmacokinetic properties should also be included as important filters in virtual screening. Here, the current development in theoretical models to predict drug absorption-related properties, such as intestinal absorption, Caco-2 permeability, and blood-brain partitioning are reviewed. The important physicochemical properties used in the prediction of drug absorption, and the relevance of predictive models in the evaluation of passive drug absorption are discussed. Recent developments in the prediction of drug absorption, especially with the application of new machine learning methods and newly developed software are also discussed. Future directions for research are outlined.

A conceptual framework for the optical property function elicitation process is proposed and particularized for the use of attribute-value classifiers. The process is evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed using four different off-the-shelf classifiers (J48, Naive Bayes, Simple Logistic and ECOC-Adaboost) The empirical results confirm the classification of biomedical datasets as a tough problem where an opportunity for further research emerges.			cerquide@maia.ub.es					Allwein E.L., 2000, P 17 INT C MACH LEAR, P9; Domingos P, 1997, MACH LEARN, V29, P103, DOI 10.1023/A:1007413511361; Drebin R.

Machine learning techniques for in silico modeling of drug metabolism	CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review						in silico ADMET; QSAR; classification; drug metabolism; cytochrome P450; machine learning; non-linear models	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; UDP-GLUCURONOSYLTRANSFERASE ISOFORMS; CYTOCHROME-P450 3A4 INHIBITORS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ACTIVE-SITES; CHEMICAL METABOLISM; COMPOUND LIBRARIES; AQUEOUS SOLUBILITY; QSPR MODELS; PREDICTION	The computational assessment of drug metabolism has gained considerable interest in pharmaceutical research. Amongst others, machine learning techniques have been employed to model relationships between the chemical Structure of a compound and its metabolic fate. Examples for these techniques, which were originally developed in fields far from drug discovery, are artificial neural networks or Support vector machines. This paper summarizes the application of various machine learning techniques to predict the interaction between organic molecules and metabolic enzymes. More complex endpoints Such as metabolic stability or in vivo clearance will also be addressed. It is shown that the prediction of metabolic endpoints with machine learning techniques has made considerable progress over the past few years. Depending oil the procedure used, either classification or quantitative prediction is possible for even large and diverse compound sets. Together with the expanding experimental data basis, these in silico methods have become valuable tools in the drug discovery and development process.

J	Arimoto, R				Arimoto, Rieko			Computational models for predicting interactions with cytochrome p450 enzyme	CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review							MOLECULAR-FIELD ANALYSIS; SUBSTRATE-BINDING-SITE; COMPETITIVE CYP2C9 INHIBITORS; RELATIONSHIP 3D/4D-QSAR ANALYSES; P450-MEDIATED DRUG-METABOLISM; ACTIVE-SITE; PHARMACOPHORE MODEL; COMBINED PROTEIN; 3A4 INHIBITORS; CATALYTIC ACTIVITY	Cytochrome p450 (CYP) enzymes are predominantly involved in Phase I metabolism of xenobiotics. As only 6 isoenzymes are responsible for similar to 90% of known oxidative drug metabolism, a number of frequently prescribed drugs share the CYP-mediated metabolic pathways. Competing for a single enzyme by the co-administered therapeutic agents can Substantially alter the plasma concentration and clearance of the agents. Furthermore, many drugs are known to inhibit certain p450 enzymes which they are not substrates for. Because some drug-drug interactions could cause serious adverse events leading to a costly failure of drug development, early detection of potential drug-drug interactions is highly desirable. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the CYP specificity and the interactions for a novel compound from its chemical structure. Current computational modeling approaches, such as two-dimensional and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), pharmacophore mapping and machine learning methods have resulted in statistically valid predictions. Homology models have been often combined with 3D-QSAR models to impose additional steric restrictions and/or to identify the interaction site on the proteins. This article summarizes the available models, methods, and key findings for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 isoenzymes.

However there are often two obstacles to the implementation of this approach in practice: (1) that developing correct and/or faulty behavioral patterns can be a difficult, labor-intensive process, and (2) that use of such pattern-monitoring must provide rapid turn-around or response time. We present a novel data structure, called extended action graph, and associated algorithms to overcome these drawbacks. At its core, our technique relies on effectively identifying and caching specifications from (correct/faulty) patterns learned via machine-learning algorithm. We describe the design and implementation of our technique and show its practical applicability in the domain of security monitoring of sendmail software.

Christmann and Rousseeuw (CR01) showed that RDM is also useful for the case of binary regression. Vapnik's convex risk minimization principle [Vap98] has a dominating role in statistical machine learning theory. Important special cases are the support vector machine (SVM), epsilon-support vector regression and kernel logistic regression. In this paper connections between these methods from different disciplines are investigated for the case of pattern recognition.

Microarray data is one example of such data which has received much attention in recent years. Machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) are ideal for microarray data due to its high classification accuracies. However, sometimes the information being sought is a list of genes which best separates the classes, and not a classification rate. Decision trees are one alternative which do not perform as well as SVMs, but their output is easily understood by non-specialists. A major obstacle with applying current decision tree implementations for high-dimensional data sets is their tendency to assign the same scores for multiple attributes. In this paper, we propose two distribution-dependant criteria for decision trees to improve their usefulness for microarray classification.

SAGE is better than Microarray in that SAGE can monitor both known and unknown genes while Microarray can only measure known genes. SAGE gene expression profiling based cancer classification is a better choice since cancers may be due to some unknown genes. Whereas a wide range of methods has been applied to traditional Microarray based cancer classification, relatively few studies have been done on SAGE based cancer classification. In our study we evaluate popular machine learning methods (SVM, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, C4.5 and RIPPER) for classifying cancers based on SAGE data. In order to deal with the high dimensional problem, we propose to use Chi-square for tag/gene selection. Both binary classification and multicategory classification are investigated. The experiments are based on two human SAGE datasets: brain and breast. The results show that SVM and Naive Bayes are the top-performing SAGE classifiers and that Chi-square based gene selection can improve the performance of all the five classifiers investigated.

However, most learning techniques used in class prediction in gene expression analysis during the past years generate black-box models. Although the prediction accuracy of these models could be very well, they provide little insight into the biological facts. This paper holds the recognition that a more reasonable role for machine learning techniques is to generate hypotheses that can be verified or refined by human experts instead of making decisions for human experts. Based on this recognition, a general approach to generate comprehensible hypotheses from gene expression data is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to help form hypotheses on the relationship between genes and certain diseases.

It has been confirmed by multiple studies that terrorist attackers have experienced a substantial emotional distress at some points before committing a terrorist attack. Therefore, if an individual in emotional distress can be detected on the basis of email texts, some preventive measures can be taken. The proposed detection machinery is based on extraction and classification of emotional profiles from emails. An emotional profile is a formal representation of a sequence of emotional states through a textual discourse where communicative actions are attached to these emotional states. The issues of extraction of emotional profiles from text and reasoning about it are discussed and illustrated. We then develop an inductive machine learning and reasoning framework to relate an emotional profile to the class "Emotional distress" or "No emotional distress", given a training dataset where the class is assigned by an expert. TSED's machine learning is evaluated using the database of structured customer complaints.

J	Gu, LF; Baxter, R				Gu, LF; Baxter, R			Decision models for record linkage	DATA MINING: THEORY, METHODOLOGY, TECHNIQUES, AND APPLICATIONS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article						data linking; record linkage; probabilistic linking; decision model; clustering; classification		The process of identifying record pairs that represent the same real-world entity in multiple databases, commonly known as record linkage, is one of the important steps in many data mining applications. In this paper, we address one of the sub-tasks in record linkage, i.e., the problem of assigning record pairs with an appropriate matching status. Techniques for solving this problem are referred to as decision models. Most existing decision models rely on good training data, which is, however, not commonly available in real-world applications. Decision models based on unsupervised machine learning techniques have recently been proposed. In this paper, we review several existing decision models and then propose an enhancement to cluster-based decision models. Experimental results show that our proposed decision model achieves the same accuracy of existing models while significantly reducing the number of record pairs required for manual review. The proposed model also provides a mechanism to trade off the accuracy with the number of record pairs required for clerical review.

The aim is not to predict a continuous variable (regression) or a categorical variable (classification) but to construct a hierarchy. The dendrogram of the hierarchy is easy to interpret and can be read as decision tree. An example of this new type of dendrogram is given on a small categorical dataset. DIVCLUS-T is then compared empirically with two polythetic clustering methods: the Ward ascendant hierarchical clustering method and the k-means partitional method. The three algorithms are applied and compared on six databases of the UCI Machine Learning repository.

Traditional network approaches to group identification encounter a variety of problems when the data to be analyzed involve two-mode networks, i.e., relations between two distinct sets of objects with no reflexive relation allowed within each set. In this paper we propose a relatively novel approach to the recognition and identification of social groups in data generated by network-based processes in the context of two-mode networks. Our approach is based on a family of learning algorithms called Support Vector Machines (SVM). The analytical framework provided by SVM provides a flexible statistical environment to solve classification tasks, and to reframe regression and density estimation problems. We explore the relative merits of our approach to the analysis of social networks in the context of the well known "Southern women" (SW) data set collected by Davis Gardner and Gardner. We compare our results with those that have been produced by different analytical approaches. We show that our method, which acts as a data-independent preprocessing step, is able to reduce the complexity of the clustering problem enabling the application of simpler configurations of common algorithms.

The main resistance against these newer techniques is based on their lack of interpretability: it is difficult for the human analyst to understand the motivation behind these models' decisions. Various rule extraction techniques have been proposed to overcome this opacity restriction. However, most of these extraction techniques are devised for classification and only few algorithms can deal with regression problems. In this paper, we present ITER, a new algorithm for pedagogical regression rule extraction. Based on a trained 'black box' model, ITER is able to extract human-understandable regression rules. Experiments show that the extracted model performs well in comparison with CART regression trees and various other techniques.

A promising approach to mitigate this problem is to enable the user to submit a rough approximation of the desired query and use relevance feedback on retrieved objects to refine the query. In this paper, we explore such a refinement strategy for a general class of structured similarity queries. Our approach casts the refinement problem as that of learning concepts using the tuples on which the user provides feedback as a labeled training set. Under this setup, similarity query refinement consists of two learning tasks: learning the structure of the query and learning the relative importance of query components. The paper develops machine learning approaches suitable for the two learning tasks. The primary contribution of the paper is the Refinement Activation Framework (RAF) that decides when each learner is invoked. Experimental analysis over many real life datasets shows that our strategy significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of retrieval quality.

Two distinct document representation formalisms are employed to characterize these messages, namely a standard word-based approach and a character n-gram document representation. Moreover, two distinct data sets, both with and without e-mail header information, are compared. Based on these document representations, the categorization performance of the various machine learning approaches is assessed and a comparison is given. The results indicate a substantial increase in classification accuracy when header information is considered in the document representation. To a much lesser degree, word-based document representations are advantageous over n-gram representations.

The Matter-Element equation is used to get the transitive closure of answers by setting several parameters, the process of Knowledge-Activation is carried out and it makes the knowledge-library increasing spontaneously Finally, the knowledge emergence is measured by the criterion defined in the end; a better model of Machine Learning is completed.

First of all, the paper explains the reinforcement learning which involves the environmental information of interval numbers, and then offers the steps of the Q-learning algorithm and the two principles to define the Optimum strategies, both of which are based on the information of interval numbers. This kind of algorithm is characterized by the fact that in the reinforcement learning the utility function and the reward signal can be expressed as the interval numbers and the two principles offered show that the algorithm proposed has the convergence. In the algorithm, it is Suggested that the combination Boltzmann of mechanism with the experiential inference can effectively expand the exploration so as to avoid the partial optimum. This is helpful for the learning machine to accumulate experience and to maintain the stability of fine strategies.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a popular topic in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for its abilities to perform classification and regression in recent years. Solving a support vector machine problem is a typical quadratic optimization problem, which is influenced by its time complexity. A FS-SVM algorithm based on Fisher score and SVM was presented in this paper. This algorithm was applied on KDDCUP'99 standard Intrusion Detection dataset. The experiment results show, using FS-SVM algorithm to select the important features from the original feature space is an effective method to reduce the dimension of the example feature vector. The classification accuracy has not decrease comparing to the original feature space in general.

Compression and machine learning: A new perspective on feature space vectors	DCC 2006: Data Compression Conference, Proceedings	IEEE DATA COMPRESSION CONFERENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	Data Compression Conference	MAR 28-30, 2006	Snowbird, UT	Brandeis Univ, Comp Sci Dept				The use of compression algorithms in machine learning tasks such as clustering and classification has appeared in a variety of fields, sometimes with the promise of reducing problems of explicit feature selection. The theoretical justification for such methods has been founded on an tipper bound on Kolmogorov complexity and an idealized information space. An alternate view shows compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. Thus, compression-based methods are not a "parameter free" magic bullet for feature selection and data representation, but are instead concrete similarity measures within defined feature spaces, and are therefore akin to explicit feature vector models used in standard machine learning algorithms. To underscore this point, we find theoretical and empirical connections between traditional machine learning vector models and compression, encouraging cross-fertilization in future work.

Typical applications range from overall lifestyle improvement to helping people with special needs such as the elderly and the disabled to improve their independence, safety and security at home. Research in the area has looked into ways of making the home environment automatic and automated devices have been designed to help the disabled people. Also, possibilities of automated health monitoring systems and usage of automatic controlled devices to replace caregiver and housekeeper have received significant attention. Most of the models require acquisition of useful information from the environment, identification of the significant features and finally usage of some sort of machine learning techniques for decision making and planning for the next action to be undertaken. This chapter specifically focuses on neural networks applications in building a smart home environment.

Here we revisit an attractively simple model for EMI response of a metallic object, namely a hypothetical anisotropic, infinitesimal magnetic dipole characterized by its magnetic polarizability tensor, and investigate the extent to which one can train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to produce reliable gross characterization of objects based on the inferred tensor elements as discriminators. We obtain the frequency-dependent polarizability tensor elements for various object characteristics by using analytical solutions to the EMI equations. Then, using synthetic data and focusing, on gross shape and especially size, we evaluate the classification success of different SVM formulations for different kinds of objects.

However, these general purpose learning algorithms make implicit assumptions that are commonly violated in CAD problems. We propose a new ensemble algorithm that explicitly accounts for the small fraction of outlier images which tend to produce a large number of false positives. A bootstrapping procedure is used to ensure that the candidates from these outlier images do not skew the statistical properties of the training samples. Experimental studies on the detection of clusters of micro-calcifications indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art general purpose method for designing classifiers (SVM), in terms of FROC curves on a hold out test set.

In this paper, we propose a new relevance criterion for variable ranking in a regression problem with a large number of variables. This criterion comes from a discretization of both input and output variables, derived as an extension of a Bayesian non parametric discretization method for the classification case. For that, we introduce a family of discretization grid models and a prior distribution defined on this model space. For this prior, we then derive the exact Bayesian model selection criterion. The obtained most probable grid-partition of the data emphasizes the relation (or the absence of relation) between inputs and output and provides a ranking criterion for the input variables. Preliminary experiments both on synthetic and real data demonstrate the criterion capacity to select the most relevant variables and to improve a regression tree.

In this paper, identifying historical period and ethnic origin of documents using stylistic feature sets is investigated. The application domain is Jewish Law articles written in Hebrew-Aramaic. Such documents present various interesting problems for stylistic classification. Firstly, these documents include words from both languages. Secondly, Hebrew and Aramaic are richer than English in their morphology forms. The classification is done using six different sets of stylistic features: quantitative features, orthographic features, topographic features, lexical features and vocabulary richness. Each set of features includes various baseline features, some of them formalized by us. SVM has been chosen as the applied machine learning method since it has been very successful in text classification. The quantitative set was found as very successful and superior to all other sets. Its features are domain-independent and language-independent. It will be interesting to apply these feature sets in general and the quantitative set in particular into other domains as well as into other.

Distance-based clustering algorithms rarely have the means to autonomously come up with the correct number of clusters from the data. A recent approach to identifying the natural clusters is to compare the point densities in different parts of the sample space. In this paper we put forward an agglomerative clustering algorithm which accesses density information by constructing a Voronoi diagram for the input sample. The volumes of the point cells directly reflect the point density in the respective parts of the instance space. Scanning through the input points and their Voronoi cells once, we combine the densest parts of the instance space into clusters. Our empirical experiments demonstrate the proposed algorithm is able to come up with a high-accuracy clustering for many different types of data. The Voronoi approach clearly outperforms k-means algorithm on data conforming to its underlying assumptions.

The system identifies and classifies NEs in the Hungarian and English languages by applying AdaBoostM1 and the C4.5 decision tree learning algorithm. We focused on building as large a feature set as possible, and used a split and recombine technique to fully exploit its potentials. This methodology provided an opportunity to train several independent decision tree classifiers based on different subsets of features and combine their decisions in a majority voting scheme. The corpus made for the CoNLL 2003 conference and a segment of Szeged Corpus was used for training and validation purposes. Both of them consist entirely of newswire articles. Our system remains portable across languages without requiring any major modification and slightly outperforms the best system of CoNLL 2003, and achieved a 94.77% F measure for Hungarian. The real value of our approach lies in its different basis compared to other top performing models for English, which makes our system extremely successful when used in combination with CoNLL modells.

The main measure for choosing a particular model is a goodness of fit criterion on a given dataset. While this measure indicates how well the model fits the data, it has little relation to the predictive accuracy of the model and therefore may not generalize beyond the given dataset. This aspect is not frequently considered in epidemiology. We suggest using modern machine learning methods for constructing and validating epidemiological models. The resulting models can be used to confirm epidemiologist's models or to suggest possible improvements. These approaches also provide estimates and confidence measures for the parameters and the predictive ability of the model.

Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) was used to screen for potential biomarkers indicative of skeletal involvement in patients with MM. Serum samples from 48 MM patients, 24 with more than three bone lesions and 24 with no evidence of bone lesions were fractionated and analyzed in duplicate using copper ion loaded immobilized metal affinity SELDI chip arrays. The spectra obtained were compiled, normalized, and mass peaks with mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) between 2000 and 20,000 Da identified. Peak information from all fractions was combined together and analyzed using univariate statistics, as well as a linear, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and a non-linear, random forest (RF), classification algorithm. The PLS-DA model resulted in prediction accuracy between 96-100%, while the RF model was able to achieve a specificity and sensitivity of 87.5% each. Both models as well as multiple comparison adjusted univariate analysis identified a set of four peaks that were the most discriminating between the two groups of patients and hold promise as potential biomarkers for future diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.

This paper concerns the design of an automated system for performing the task of taking as input scanned images of handwritten student essays in reading comprehension tests and to produce as output scores for the answers which are analogous to those provided by human scorers. The system is based on integrating the two technologies of optical handwriting recognition (OHR) and automated essay scoring (AES). The OHR system performs several pre-processing steps such as forms removal, rule-line removal and segmentation of text lines and words. The final recognition step, which is tuned to the task of reading comprehension evaluation in a primary education setting, is performed using a lexicon derived from the passage to be read. The AES system is based on the approach of latent semantic analysis where a set of human-scored answers are used to determine scoring system parameters using a machine learning approach. System performance is compared to scoring done by human raters. Testing on a small set of handwritten answers indicate that system performance is comparable to that of automatic scoring based on manual transcription.

Using a single neural network, ImageRefiner learned which image enhancement transformations (filters) were best suited for a given document image and a given OCR engine, based on various image measurements (characteristics). The new release improves ImageRefiner in three major ways. First, to process grayscale document images, we have included three grayscale filters based on smart thresholding and noise filtering, as well as five image characteristics that are all byproducts of various thresholding techniques. Second. we have implemented additional ML algorithms, including a neural network ensemble and several "all-pairs" classifiers. Third, we have introduced a measure that evaluates overall performance of the system in terms of cumulative improvement of OCR accuracy, Our experiments indicate that OCR accuracy on enhanced grayscale images is hi-her than that of both the original grayscale images and the corresponding bitonal images obtained by scanning the same documents. We have noticed that the system's performance may suffer when document characteristics are correlated.

The selection of effective chromatic combinations and the relation of colour to the perceived aesthetic and emotional value of a web site is the focus of this paper. The subject of the reported research has been to define a model through which to be able to associate colour combinations with specific desirable emotional and aesthetic values. The presented approach involves application of machine learning techniques on a rich data set collected during a number of empirical studies. The data obtained were used to train a Bayesian Belief Network which associated a simple chromatic model to perceived aesthetic and emotional dimensions. A set of tools that have been build in the process to support the methodological framework and ensure its reusability with minimal effort, are also described.

We demonstrate a system for automatically reformulating CSP solver models by combining the capabilities of machine learning and automated theorem proving with CSP systems. Our system is given a basic CSP formulation and outputs a set of reformulations, each of which includes additional constraints. The additional constraints are generated through a machine learning process and are proven to follow from the basic formulation by a theorem prover. Experimenting with benchmark problem classes from finite algebras, we show how the time invested in reformulation is often recovered many times over when searching for solutions to more difficult problems from the problem class.

This approach combines machine learning from examples with concepts from the field of argumentation. The idea is to provide expert's arguments, or reasons, for some of the learning examples. We require that the theory induced from the examples explains the examples in terms of the given reasons. Thus arguments constrain the combinatorial search among possible hypotheses, and also direct the search towards hypotheses that are more comprehensible in the light of expert's background knowledge. In this paper we implement ABCN2 as an extension of the CN2 rule learning algorithm, and analyze its advantages in comparison with the original CN2 algorithm.

We present a complementary approach that utilizes expert knowledge to overcome the scarceness of annotated data. In our framework KAFTIE, the expert could easily create a large number of rules in a systematic manner without the need of a knowledge engineer. Using KAFTIE, a knowledge base was built based on a small data set that outperforms machine learning algorithms trained on a much bigger data set for the task of recognizing temporal relations. Furthermore, our knowledge acquisition approach could be used in synergy with machine learning algorithms to both increase the performance of the machine learning algorithms and to reduce the expert's knowledge acquisition effort.

In this paper we present a spam filtering system that uses example-based machine learning techniques to train a classifier from examples of spam and legitimate email. This approach has the advantage that it can personalise to the specifics of the user's filtering preferences. This classifier can also automatically adjust over time to account for the changing nature of spam (and indeed changes in the profile of legitimate email). A significant software engineering challenge in developing this system was to ensure that it could interoperate with existing email systems to allow easy managment of the training data over time. This system has been deployed and evaluated over an extended period and the results of this evaluation are presented here.

The open interactive nature of these environments results in users experiencing difficulties in coping with the plethora of available functions, especially during their initial efforts to use the system. In addition, - from the tutors' perspective - the problem solving strategies of the students are often particularly difficult to identify. In this paper, we argue that such problems could be tackled using machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Networks. We show how we can take advantage of log files obtained during field studies to build an adaptive help system providing the most useful support to the student, according to the state of interaction. On the other hand, we attempt to support the tutor, by automating the process of diagnosing students' problem solving strategies using Bayesian Networks. The presented approaches are discussed through examples of two prototypes that have been developed and corresponding evaluation studies. These studies have shown that the proposed approach can effectively support the tasks of students and tutors in such open learning environments.

Such connections between blogs form blog networks, which can be a useful information source in recommending information to the user. In this study, we analyze which pages the users in a blog network read most frequently from the viewpoint of the relationship among blogs, and interpret the result. The factors influencing reading by users are analyzed by a machine learning algorithm, and it is shown that reading through links occupies a large percentage of all reading activity in a blog network. The acquired data also suggest that a blog that is the destination of comments or trackback actions by the manager of the blog which a user is reading is also highly likely to be a blog of interest to the user.

There are several challenges to be covered. This paper focuses on context reasoning, which means deducing higher context from raw sensor data. The context reasoning problem is discussed on two different levels: context inference/recognition concerning the generation of context atoms from raw sensor data, and context reasoning concerning the composition of context atoms and deduction of higher-level context. In this paper, we discuss some commonly used reasoning technologies in context-aware systems, including rule-based logics and machine learning methods. Besides, a clustering algorithm, the Symbol Clustering Map, is introduced to learn the current context.

The aim of the present work is to provide the existing system with an intelligent module that will capture, store and apply user preferences in order to eventually automate the task of solution selection. A combination of two components based on decision support and artificial intelligence methodologies respectively are currently being implemented. A method is also proposed for the fair and efficient comparison of the results.

Given a machine segmentation and a ground-truth segmentation, performance measures are needed. We propose to consider the image segmentation problem as one of data clustering and, as a consequence, to use measures for comparing clusterings developed in statistics and machine learning. By doing so, we obtain a variety of performance measures which have not been used before in image processing. In particular, some of these measures have the highly desired property of being a metric. Experimental results are reported on both synthetic and real data to validate the measures and compare them with others. Copyright (C) 2006 Hindawi Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

Learning-based nonparametric image super-resolution	EURASIP JOURNAL ON APPLIED SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGE; REGISTRATION	We present a novel learning-based framework for zooming and recognizing images of digits obtained from vehicle registration plates, which have been blurred using an unknown kernel. We model the image as an undirected graphical model over image patches in which the compatibility functions are represented as nonparametric kernel densities. The crucial feature of this work is an iterative loop that alternates between super-resolution and restoration stages. A machine-learning-based framework has been used for restoration which also models spatial zooming. Image segmentation is done by a column-variance estimation-based "dissection" algorithm. Initially, the compatibility functions are learned by nonparametric kernel density estimation, using random samples from the training data. Next, we solve the inference problem by using an extended version of the nonparametric belief propagation algorithm, in which we introduce the notion of partial messages. Finally, we recognize the super-resolved and restored images. The resulting confidence scores are used to sample from the training set to better learn the compatibility functions.

J	Yao, CC; Yu, PT				Yao, Chih-Chia; Yu, Pao-Ta			The optimal design of weighted order statistics filters by using support vector machines	EURASIP JOURNAL ON APPLIED SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							ADAPTIVE IMAGE-RESTORATION; STACK FILTERS; MEDIAN FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; REPRESENTATION	Support vector machines (SVMs), a classification algorithm for the machine learning community, have been shown to provide higher performance than traditional learning machines. In this paper, the technique of SVMs is introduced into the design of weighted order statistics (WOS) filters. WOS filters are highly effective, in processing digital signals, because they have a simple window structure. However, due to threshold decomposition and stacking property, the development of WOS filters cannot significantly improve both the design complexity and estimation error. This paper proposes a new designing technique which can improve the learning speed and reduce the complexity of designing WOS filters. This technique uses a dichotomous approach to reduce the Boolean functions from 255 levels to two levels, which are separated by an optimal hyperplane. Furthermore, the optimal hyperplane is gotten by using the technique of SVMs. Our proposed method approximates the optimal weighted order statistics filters more rapidly than the adaptive neural filters.

The support vector machine (SVM) method is a well-known and reliable machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks. Based on a recently developed shared memory decomposition algorithm for support vector machine classifier design we increased the level of parallelism by implementing a cross validation routine based on message passing. With this extention we obtained a flexible parallel SVM software that can be used on high-end machines with SMP architectures to process the large data sets that arise more and more in bioinformatics and other fields of research.

Multiple Property Tolerance Analysis for the Evaluation of Missense Mutations	EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Computational prediction of the impact of a mutation on protein function is still not accurate enough for clinical diagnostics without additional human expert analysis. Sequence alignment-based methods have been extensively used but their results highly depend on the quality of the input alignments and the choice of sequences. Incorporating the structural information with alignments improves prediction accuracy. Here, we present a conservation of amino acid properties method for mutation prediction, Multiple Properties Tolerance Analysis (MuTA), and a new strategy, MuTA/S, to incorporate the solvent accessible surface (SAS) property into MuTA. Instead of combining multiple features by machine learning or mathematical methods, an intuitive strategy is used to divide the residues of a protein into different groups, and in each group the properties used is adjusted. The results for LacI, lysozyme, and HIV protease show that MuTA performs as well as the widely used SIFT algorithm while MuTA/S outperforms SIFT and MuTA by 2%-25% in terms of prediction accuracy. By incorporating the SAS term alone, the alignment dependency of overall prediction accuracy is significantly reduced. MuTA/S also defines a new way to incorporate any structural features and knowledge and may lead to more accurate predictions.

In spite of these considerable results, the existing methods lack the ability to explain the process of how a learning result is reached and why a prediction decision is made. The explanation of a decision made is important for the acceptance of machine learning technology in bioinformatics applications such as protein structure prediction. While support vector machines (SVNI) have shown strong generalization ability in a number of application areas, including protein structure prediction, they are black box models and hard to understand. On the other hand, decision trees provide insightful interpretation, however, they have lower prediction accuracy. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to rule generation for understanding prediction of transmembrane segments by integrating the merits of both SVMs and decision trees. This approach combines SVMs with decision trees into a new algorithm called SVNI - DT. The results of the experiments for prediction of transmembrane segments on 165 low-resolution test data set show that not only the comprehensibility of SVM-DT is much better than that of SVMs, but also that the test accuracy of these rules is high as well. Rules with confidence values over 90% have an average prediction accuracy of 93.4%. We also found that confidence and prediction accuracy values of the rules generated by SVM-DT are quite consistent. We believe that SVNI - DT can be used not only for transmembrane segments prediction, but also for understanding the prediction. The prediction and its interpretation obtained can be used for guiding biological experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although relatively high accuracy has been achieved by existing methods, most of these prediction methods are computationally extensive. Due to the enormous amount of DNA sequences to be processed, the computational speed is an important issue to consider. In this paper, we present a new machine learning method for predicting DNA splice sites, which first applies a Bayes feature mapping (kernel) to project the data into a new feature space and then uses a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier to recognize the true splice sites. The computation time is linear to the number of sequences tested, while the performance is notably improved compared with the Naive Bayes classifier in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and recall. Our classification results are also comparable to the solution quality obtained by the SVMs with polynomial kernels, while the speed of our proposed method is significantly faster. This is a notable improvement in computational modeling considering the huge amount of DNA sequences to be processed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To this end, biomedical named entity recognition (NER) from natural language text is indispensable. Current NER approaches include: dictionary based, rule based, or machine learning based. Since, there is no consolidated nomenclature for most biomedical NEs, any NER system relying on limited dictionaries or rules does not seem to perform satisfactorily. In this paper, we consider a machine learning model, CRF, for the construction of our NER framework. CRF is a well-known model for solving other sequence tagging problems. In our framework, we do our best to utilize available resources including dictionaries, web corpora, and lexical analyzers, and represent them as linguistic features in the CRF model. In the experiment on the JNLPBA 2004 data, with minimal post-processing, our system achieves an F-score of 70.2%, which is better than most state-of-the-art systems. On the GENIA 3.02 corpus, our system achieves an F-score of 78.4% for protein names, which is 2.8% higher than the next-best system. In addition, we also examine the usefulness of each feature in our CRF model. Our experience could be valuable to other researchers working on machine learning based NER. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Aggressive destabilisation/restabilisation sequences are used for training, such that a wide state-space envelope is covered during training. The performance of heading, roll, pitch, height and lateral velocity control learning is presented using our Xcell 60 experimental platform. The helicopter is demonstrated to be stabilised on all axes using the "learning from a pilot" technique. To our knowledge, this is the first time a "learning from a pilot" technique has been successfully applied to all axes.

This paper presents a kind of fuzzy information retrieve method based on soft computing (SCFIR for short). SCFIR adopts fuzzy clustering analysis and artificial neural networks to organize databases in systems so as to increase the efficiency of fuzzy retrieve. At the same time, SCFTR realizes the understanding of query sentences in natural language by means of heuristic induct leading mechanism, interactional grammar analysis and semantic analysis. Finally, SCFTR applies several machine learning mechanisms (such as connective learning, evolutive learning, rough sets and so on) in the maintenance of system knowledge base, and thus the effectiveness and feasibility of retrieve systems are improved availably.

As a binary classifier of GPI-(like)anchored proteins and non GPI-(like)-anchored proteins, a supervised machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and simple representation of C-terminus of protein primary sequences with mean hydrophobicity were used Not merely does the classifier show high accuracy of 96.00% under 5-fold cross validation test, but also the AUC as a good summary of the performance of the classifier reaches to 0.97. In virtue of being based on SVM, computational efficiency and remarkable generalization ability of our classifier will he helpful for protein annotation in whole genomic-wide.

Many criteria have been proposed and used in such a process. Each criterion measures some facets of classifiers. However, none is good enough for all cases. In this communication, we justify the use of discrimination measures for evaluating classifiers. The justification is mainly based on a hierarchical model for discrimination measures, which was introduced and used in the induction of decision trees.

A granular computing model is suggested for learning two basic issues of concept formation and concept relationship identification. A classification problem can be considered as a search for suitable granules organized under a, partial order. The structures of search space, solutions to a consistent classification problem, and the structures of solution space are discussed. A classification rule induction Method is proposed. Instead of searching for a suitable partition, we concentrate on the search for a suitable covering of the given universe. This method is more general than partition-based methods. For the design of covering granule selection heuristics, several measures on granules are suggested.

In this sense, argument-based machine learning (ABML) is defined as a refinement of the usual definition of ML. In ABML, some learning examples are accompanied by arguments, that are expert's reasons for believing why these examples are as they are. Thus ABML provides a natural way of introducing domain-specific prior knowledge in a way that is different from the traditional, general background knowledge. The task of ABML is to find a theory that explains the "argumented" examples by making reference to the given reasons. ABML, so defined, is motivated by the following advantages in comparison with standard learning from examples: (1) arguments impose constraints over the space of possible hypotheses, thus reducing search complexity, and (2) induced theories should make more sense to the expert. Ways of realising ABML by extending some existing ML techniques are discussed, and the aforementioned advantages of ABML are demonstrated experimentally.

The basic algorithms of Formal Concept Analysis then allow an intelligent information retrieval system to cluster documents according to keyword views. This paper investigates the scalability of this idea. In particular we present the results of applying spatial data structures to large datasets in formal concept analysis. Our experiments are motivated by the application of the Formal Concept Analysis idea of a virtual filesystem [11,17,15]. In particular the libferris [1] Semantic File System. This paper presents customizations to an RD-Tree Generalized Index Search Tree based index structure to better support the application of Formal Concept Analysis to large data sources.

This problem, known as regression, requires that samples of past experience with known continuous answers are examined and generalized in a regression model to be used in predicting future examples. Regression algorithms deeply investigated in statistics, machine learning and data mining usually lack measures to give an indication of how "good" the predictions are. Tolerance regions, i.e., a range of possible predictive values, can provide a measure of reliability for every bare prediction. In this paper, we focus on tree-based prediction models, i.e., model trees, and resort to the inductive inference to output tolerance regions in addition to bare prediction. In particular, we consider model trees mined by SMOTI (Stepwise Model Tree Induction) that is a system for data-driven stepwise construction of model trees with regression and splitting nodes and we extend the definition of trees to build tolerance regions to be associated with each leaf. Experiments evaluate validity and quality of output tolerance regions.

Optimal multivariate discretization is in general computationally intractable. We have proposed approximation algorithms with performance guarantees for training error minimization by axis-parallel hyperplanes. This work studies their efficiency and practicability. We give efficient implementations to both greedy set covering and linear programming approximation of optimal multivariate discretization. We also contrast the algorithms empirically to an efficient heuristic discretization method.

Current approaches often rely on an environment expert to correlate the situations that occur with the available sensor data, while other machine learning based approaches require long training periods before the system can be used. This paper presents a novel approach to situation determination that attempts to overcome these issues by providing a reusable library of general situation specifications that can be easily extended to create new specific situations, and immediately deployed without the need of an environment expert. A proposed architecture of an accompanying situation determination middleware is provided, as well as an analysis of a prototype implementation.

ESPI (Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry) is a non-contacting measuring method, which can measure the small static and dynamitic surface deformations and reveal the flaws by looking for flaw-induced deformation anomalies. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theory, and it has recently been established as a powerful tool for classification and regression problems. To develop the precision of processing the pattern fringe data, the SVM is introduced to process the patterns corrupted by the laser speckle effect. The SVM is trained with fringe patterns generated from a finite element model and a simple model of the laser speckle effect. The output pattern is obtained to flag whether the damage exists or not.

The two most promising control tools for freeway corridors are traffic-responsive ramp metering and dynamic traffic diversion using variable message signs (VMSs). The use of these control methods independently could limit, their usefulness. Therefore, integrated corridor control by using ramp metering and VMS diversion simultaneously could be beneficial. Administration of freeways and adjacent arterials often falls under different jurisdictional authorities. Lack of coordination among those authorities caused by lack of means for information exchange or "institutional gridlock" could hinder the full potential of technically possible, integrated control. Fully automating corridor control could alleviate this problem. Research was conducted to develop a self-learning adaptive integrated freeway-arterial corridor control for both recurring and nonrecurring congestion. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence method for machine learning, is used to provide a single, multiple, or integrated optimal control agent for a freeway or freeway-arterial corridor for both recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion. The microsimulation tool Paramics, which has been used to train and evaluate the agent in an offline mode within a simulated environment, is described. Results from various simulation case studies in the Toronto, Canada, area are encouraging and have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the technique.

Through a playful interaction with the surrounding environment, they test their own capabilities, explore novel situations, and understand how their actions affect the world. During this kind of exploration, interesting situations may be discovered. By learning to reach these situations, a child incrementally develops more and more complex skills. Inspired by studies from psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning, we designed SMILe (Self-Motivated Incremental Learning), a learning framework that allows artificial agents to autonomously identify and learn a set of abilities useful to face several different tasks, through an iterated three phase process: by means of a random exploration of the environment (babbling phase), the agent identifies interesting situations and generates an intrinsic motivation (motivating phase) aimed at learning how to get into these situations (skill acquisition phase). This process incrementally increases the skills of the agent, so that new interesting configurations can be experienced. We present results on two gridworld environments to show how SMILe makes it possible to learn skills that enable the agent to perform well and robustly in many different tasks.

While Boosting has been originally proposed in the machine learning community (Freund and Schapire (1996)), l(1)-penalization has been developed in numerical analysis and statistics (Tibshirani (1996)). Both of the methods are attractive for very high-dimensional data: they are computationally feasible and statistically consistent (e.g. Bayes risk consistent) even when the number of covariates (predictor variables) p is much larger than sample size n and if the true underlying function (mechanism) is sparse: e.g. we allow for arbitrary polynomial growth p = p(n) = O(n(gamma)) for any gamma > 0. We demonstrate high-dimensional classification, regression and graphical modeling and outline examples from genomic applications.

Active learning strives to reduce the required labeling effort while retaining the accuracy by intelligently selecting the examples to be labeled. However, very little comparison exists between different active learning methods. The effects of the ratio of positive to negative examples on the accuracy of such algorithms also received very little attention.

The previous approaches have mainly focused on feature selection of audit data and parameters optimization of intrusion detection models. However, feature selection and parameters optimization have been performed in separate way. Several hybrid approaches based on soft computing techniques are able to perform both of them together but they have more computational overheads. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Simultaneous Intrinsic Model Identification (SIMI), which enable one to perform both feature selection and parameters optimization together without any additional computational overheads. SIMI adopts Random Forest (RF) which is a promising machine learning algorithm and has been shown similar or better classification rates compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM). SIMI is able to model lightweight intrinsic intrusion detection model with optimized parameters and features. After determination of the intrinsic intrusion detection model, we visualize normal and attack patterns in 2 dimensional space using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). We carry out several experiments on KDD 1999 intrusion detection dataset and validate the feasibility of our approach.

Traditional site maps do not provide enough information about the site, and are often outdated. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based algorithm, which, combined with natural language processing, automatically constructs high quality descriptive site maps. In contrast to the previous work, our approach does not rely on heuristic rules to build site maps, and does not require specifying the number of items in a site map in advance. It also generates concise, but descriptive summaries for every site map item. Preliminary experiments with a set of educational web sites show that our method can construct site maps of high quality. An important application of our method is a new paradigm for accessing information on the Web, which integrates searching and browsing.

Ontology serves as the metadata for defining the information on semantic web. Ontology based semantic information retrieval (semantic retrieval) is becoming more and more important. Many research and industrial works have been made so far on semantic retrieval. Ontology based retrieval improves the performance of search engine and web mining. In semantic retrieval, a great number of accesses to ontologies usually lead the ontology servers to be very low efficient. To address this problem, it is indeed necessary to cache concepts and instances when ontology server is running. Existing caching methods from database community can be used in the ontology cache. However, they are not sufficient for dealing with the problem. In the task of caching in database, usually the most frequently accessed data are cached and the recently less frequently accessed data in the cache are removed from it. Different from that, in ontology base, data are organized as objects and relations between objects. User may request one object, and then request another object according to a relation of that object. He may also possibly request a similar object that has not any relations to the object. Ontology caching should consider more factors and is more difficult. In this paper, ontology caching is formalized as a problem of classification. In this way, ontology caching becomes independent from any specific semantic web application. An approach is proposed by using machine learning methods. When an object (e.g. concept or instance) is requested, we view its similar objects as candidates. A classification model is then used to predict whether each of these candidates should be cached or not. Features in classification models are defined. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the baseline methods for ontology caching. The proposed method has been applied to a research project that is called SWARMS.

Table is one of the commonest modes for presenting information. Table extraction has applications in information retrieval, knowledge acquisition, and text mining. Automatic information extraction from table is a challenge. Existing methods was mainly focusing on table extraction from web pages (formatted table extraction). So far the problem of table extraction on plain text, to the best of our knowledge, has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, unformatted table extraction is formalized as unformatted table block detection and unformatted table row identification. We concentrate particularly on the table extraction from Chinese documents. We propose to conduct the task of table extraction by combining machine learning methods and document structure. We first view the task as classification and propose a statistical approach to deal with it based on Naive Bayes. We define features in the classification model. Next, we use document structure to improve the detection performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the baseline methods for unformatted table extraction.			ljz@keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn; j-tang02@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; sq02@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; xp@keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn					CHEN HH, 2002, P 18 INT C COMP LING; COHEN W, 2002, P WWW2002 HON HAW; Klein B., 2001, Proceedings of Sixth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, DOI 10.1109/ICDAR.2001.953842; Ng H., 1999, P 37 ANN M ASS COMP, P443, DOI 10.3115/1034678.1034746; Pinto D., 2003, P 26 ANN INT ACM SIG; PYREDDY P, 1997, P 2 INT C DIG LIBR; Wang HM, 2004, CHINESE EDUC SOC, V37, P7; TANG J, 2005, J DATA SEMANTICS; TENGLI A, P 20 INT C COMP LING; ZHANG K, 2005, J TSINGHUA SCI TECHN, V45	10	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	3-540-31142-4	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2006	3841						818	823				6	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BDV60	WOS:000235658000079

Functional genomics and proteomics in the clinical neurosciences: data mining and bioinformatics	FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS IN THE CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES	PROGRESS IN BRAIN RESEARCH		English	Review							MICROARRAY EXPRESSION DATA; TANDEM MASS-SPECTRA; CROSS-VALIDATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; IDENTIFICATION; NORMALIZATION; ERROR	The goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the available computational methods for expression analysis. Genomic and proteomic experimental techniques are briefly discussed to help the reader understand these methods and results better in context with the biological significance. Furthermore, a case study is presented that will illustrate the use of these analytical methods to extract significant biomarkers from high-throughput microarray data. Genomic and proteomic data analysis is essential for understanding the underlying factors that are involved in human disease. Currently, such experimental data are generally obtained by high-throughput microarray or mass spectrometry technologies among others. The sheer amount of raw data obtained using these methods warrants specialized computational methods for data analysis. Biomarker discovery for neurological diagnosis and prognosis is one such example. By extracting significant genomic and proteomlic biomarkers in controlled experiments, we come closer to understanding how biological mechanisms contribute to neural degenerative diseases such as Alzheimers' and how drug treatments interact with the nervous system. In the biomarker discovery process, there are several computational methods that must be carefully considered to accurately analyze genomic or proteomic data. These methods include quality control, clustering, classification, feature ranking, and validation. Data quality control and normalization methods reduce technical variability and ensure that discovered biomarkers are statistically significant. Preprocessing steps must be carefully selected since they may adversely affect the results of the following expression analysis steps, which generally fall into two categories: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised or clustering methods can be used to group similar genomic or proteomic profiles and therefore can elucidate relationships within sample groups. These methods can also assign biomarkers to sub-groups based on their expression profiles across patient samples. Although clustering is useful for exploratory analysis, it is limited due to its inability to incorporate expert knowledge. On the other hand, classification and feature ranking are supervised, knowledge-based machine learning methods that estimate the distribution of biological expression data and, in doing so, can extract important information about these experiments. Classification is closely coupled with feature ranking, which is essentially a data reduction method that uses classification error estimation or other statistical tests to score features. Biomarkers can subsequently be extracted by eliminating insignificantly ranked features. These analytical methods may be equally applied to genetic and proteomic data. However, because of both biological differences between the data sources and technical differences between the experimental methods used to obtain these data, it is important to have a firm understanding of the data sources and experimental methods. At the same time, regardless of the data quality, it is inevitable that some discovered biomarkers are false positives. Thus, it is important to validate discovered biomarkers. The validation process may be slow; yet, the overall biomarker discovery process is significantly accelerated due to initial feature ranking and data reduction steps. Information obtained from the validation process may also be used to refine data analysis procedures for future iteration. Biomarker validation may be performed in a number of ways - bench-side in traditional labs, web-based electronic resources such as gene ontology and literature databases, and clinical trials.

Using anatomical standardization technique and voxel based statistics of the images, we analyzed age-related structural change of the brain. Simple volumetry or voxel based volumetry analyses of the database revealed the following results. 1) Gray matter volume linearly decreased with age, while the white matter did not show significant changes. 2) Hypertension, alcohol intake, and smoking correlated with gray matter volume decrease in regional specific brain regions. 3) Gray matter volume decreased in the subjects with subthreshold depression in the medial part of bilateral frontal lobes and the right precentral gyros than that of the normal male subjects. 4) We developed an algorism for automatic detection of ischemic changes in the white matter. 5) By using anatomical standardization technique, we defined a standard brain shape for each age group. We also constructed a database for cerebral blood flow image (CBF) of the normal subjects, as well as the subject with degenerative brain diseased and developed an automated diagnosis system for brain CBF using anatomical standardization technique and machine learning system.

Complete fingerprints are often reduced to a compressed format-of typical dimension n = 512 or n = 1024-by using a simple congruence operation. The statistical properties of complete or compressed fingerprints representations are important since fingerprints are used to rapidly search large databases and to develop statistical machine learning methods in chemoinformatics. Here we present an empirical and mathematical analysis of the distribution of complete and compressed fingerprints. In particular, we derive formulas that provide good approximation for the expected number of bits set to one in a compressed fingerprint, given its uncompressed version, and vice versa.

Furthermore, some visualization facilities are provided. The data mining framework consists of two main parts: preprocessing and clustering-agglomerating phases. To the first phase belong a noise filtering procedure and a non-linear PCA Neural Network for feature extraction. The second phase is used to accomplish an unsupervised clustering based on a hierarchy of two approaches: a Probabilistic Principal Surfaces to obtain the rough regions of interesting points and a Fisher-Negentropy information based approach to agglomerate the regions previously found in order to discover substructures present in the data. Experiments on gene microarray data are made. Several experiments are shown varying the threshold, needed by the agglomerative clustering, to understand the structure of the analyzed data set.

Simulation shows that embedding often loses relevance under improper parameters configures. But current embedding residual criterions of neighborhood parameters selection are not independent to neighborhood parameters. Therefore it cannot work universally. To improve the availability of nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms in the field of self-adaptive machine learning, it is necessary to find some transcendent criterions to achieve unsupervised parameters selection. This paper begins with a discussion of optimal embedding principles and proposes a statistics based on spatial mutual information and normalized dependency index spectrum to determine reasonable parameters configuration. The simulation supports our proposal effectively.

Our main motivation is to try to boost the co-reference resolution performance only by leveraging multiple shallow syntactic and semantic features, which can escape from tough problems such as deep syntactic and semantic structural analysis. Also, reconstruction of surface features based on contextual semantic similarity is conducted to approximate the syntactic and semantic parallel preferences in resolution linguistic theories. Furthermore, we consider two classifiers in the machine learning framework for the co-reference resolution, and performance comparison and combination between them are conducted and investigated. We experimentally evaluate our approaches on standard ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) corpus with promising results.			ffliu@nlpr.ia.ac.cn; jzhao@nlpr.ia.ac.cn					BRYANT J, 2004, COMBINING FEATURE BA; Florian R., 2004, P HUM LANG TECHN C N, P1; IIDA R, 2003, P EACL WORKSH COMP T, P23; Jurafsky D., 2000, SPEECH LANGUAGE PROC; Liu Qun, 2002, COMPUTATIONAL LINGUI, V7, P59; Mitkov R., 2002, ANAPHORA RESOLUTION; Ng V, 2002, P 40 ANN M ASS COMP, P104, DOI DOI 10.3115/1073083.1073102; NG V, 2005, P 43 ANN M ASS COMP, P157, DOI 10.3115/1219840.1219860; Soon WM, 2001, COMPUT LINGUIST, V27, P521, DOI 10.1162/089120101753342653; Strube M, 2002, P 2002 C EMP METH NA, P312, DOI DOI 10.3115/1118693.1118733; Vilain M, 1995, P 6 MESS UND C MUC 6, P45, DOI 10.3115/1072399.1072405; YANG X, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V3248, P22; *NIST, 2005, OFF EV PLAN ACE 2005	13	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	3-540-45916-2	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2006	4223						1249	1258				10	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BFD14	WOS:000241106000156

In this paper, we present an empirical study of some well known Machine Learning techniques, including various versions of Genetic Programming, which have been trained to this aim using a dataset of molecules with known bioavailability. Genetic Programming has proven the most promising technique among the ones that have been considered both from the point of view of the accurateness of the solutions proposed, of the generalization capabilities and of the correlation between predicted data and correct ones. Our work represents a first answer to the demand for quantitative bioavailability estimation methods proposed in literature, since the previous contributions focus on the classification of molecules into classes with similar bioavailability.

Does overfitting affect performance in estimation of distribution algorithms	GECCO 2006: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Vol 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 08-12, 2006	Seattle, WA	ACM SIGEVO		overfitting; estimation of distribution algorithms; Bayesian optimization algorithm; random 3-SAT		Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a class of evolutionary algorithms that use machine learning techniques to solve optimization problems. Machine learning is used to learn probabilistic models of the selected population. This model is then used to generate next population via sampling. An important phenomenon in machine learning from data is called overfitting. This occurs when the model is overly adapted to the specifics of the training data so well that even noise is encoded. The purpose of this paper is to investigate. whether overfitting happens in EDAs, and to discover its consequences. What is found is: overfitting does occur in EDAs; overfitting correlates to EDAs performance; reduction of overfitting using early stopping can improve EDAs performance.

The focus is fast learning in a real-time environment. An incremental approach combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with hill climbing is proposed. This combination interacts in an efficient way to generate precise walking patterns in less than 15 generations. Our proposal is compared to various versions of GA and stochastic search, and finally tested on a pneumatic biped walking robot.

The LEM3 implementation of learnable evolution model and its testing on complex function optimization problems	GECCO 2006: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Vol 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUL 08-12, 2006	Seattle, WA	ACM SIGEVO		evolutionary computation; learnable evolution model; function optimization; machine learning		Learnable Evolution Model (LEM) is a form of non-Darwinian evolutionary computation that employs machine learning to guide evolutionary processes. Its main novelty are new type of operators for creating new individuals, specifically, hypothesis generation, which learns rules indicating subareas in the search space that likely contain the optimum, and hypothesis instantiation, which populates these subspaces with new individuals. This paper briefly describes the newest and most advanced implementation of learnable evolution, LEM3, its novel features, and results from its comparison with a conventional, Darwinian-type evolutionary computation program (EA), a cultural evolution 'algorithm (CA), and the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) on selected function optimization problems (with the number of variables varying up to 1000). In every experiment, LEM3 outperformed the compared programs in terms of the evolution length (the number of fitness evaluations needed to achieved a desired solution), sometimes more than by one order of magnitude.

However, since few rigorous empirical comparisons have been conducted, there are no general guidelines describing the methods' relative strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents the results of a detailed empirical comparison between a GA and a TD method in Keepaway, a standard RL benchmark domain based on robot soccer. In particular, we compare the performance of NEAT [19], a GA that evolves neural networks, with Sarsa [16, 17], a popular TD method. The results demonstrate that NEAT can learn better policies in this task, though it requires more evaluations to do so. Additional experiments in two variations of Keepaway demonstrate that Sarsa learns better policies when the task is fully observable and NEAT learns faster when the task is deterministic. Together, these results help isolate the factors critical to the performance of each method and yield insights into their general strengths and weaknesses.

Semi-supervised clustering, in particular, explicitly integrates both information about the data distribution and about class memberships into the clustering process. In this paper, the potential of a multiobjective formulation of the semi-supervised clustering problem is explored, and two evolutionary multiobjective approaches to the problem are outlined. Experimental results demonstrate practical performance benefits of this methodology, including an improved classification performance and an increased robustness towards annotation errors.

It is well known that, across all possible problems, one algorithm is no better than any other. Accordingly, the traditional approach in machine learning is to choose an appropriate representation making use of some domain-specific knowledge, and this representation is then used exclusively during the learning process. To reduce reliance on domain-knowledge and its appropriate use it would be desirable for the learning algorithm to select its own representation for the problem. We investigate this with XCS, a Michigan-style Learning Classifier System. We begin with an analysis of two representations from the literature: hyperplanes and hyperspheres. We then apply XCS with either one or the other representation to two Boolean functions, the well-known multiplexer function and a function defined by hyperspheres, and confirm that planes are better suited to the multiplexer and spheres to the sphere-based function. Finally, we allow both representations to compete within XCS, which learns the most appropriate representation for problem thanks to the pressure against overlapping rules which its niche CA supplies. The result is an ecology in which the representations are species.

We show that unsupervised feature selection is inherently multi-objective and behaves differently from supervised feature selection in that the number of features must be maximized instead of being minimized. Although this might sound surprising from a supervised learning point of view, we exemplify this relationship on the problem of data clustering and show that existing approaches do not pose the optimization problem in an appropriate way. Another important consequence of this paradigm change is a method which segments the Pareto sets produced by our approach. Inspecting only prototypical points from these segments drastically reduces the amount of work for selecting a final solution. We compare our methods against existing approaches on eight data sets.

First, we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems. We then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods, namely into Support Vector Machines (SVM). In contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to SVMs we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters. We rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem. Transforming the problem into the Wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions. Exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved. We will show that evolutionary SVMs are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real-world benchmark data sets. The evolutionary SVM variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non-positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several, possibly competing, performance criteria.

One of the challenging problems in using learning classifier systems for numerical problems is the knowledge representation. The voice samples are a series of real numbers that must be encoded in a classifier format. We investigate several different methods for representing voice samples for classifier systems and study the efficacy of the methods. We also identify several challenges for learning, classifier systems in the speaker identification problem and introduce new methods to improve the learning and classification abilities of the systems. Experimental results show that our system successfully learns 200 voice features at the accuracies of 60% to 80%, which is considered a strong result in the speaker identification community.

On the other hand, the set of actions available to an MDP agent can have a significant impact on the ability of the agent to gain optimal rewards. Last year at GECCO'05, the first automated action set selection tool powered by genetic algorithms was presented. The demonstration of its capabilities, though intriguing, was limited to a single domain. In this paper, we apply the tool to a more challenging problem of oil sand image interpretation. In the new experiments, genetic algorithms evolved a compact high-performance set of image processing operators, decreasing interpretation time by 98% while improving image interpretation accuracy by 55%. These results exceed the original performance and suggest certain cross-domain portability of the approach.

In this paper, we present a CI method based in Genetic Programming (GP). This method is able to evolve projections that transform the dataset, constructing a new coordinates space in which the data can be more easily predicted. This coordinates space can be smaller than the original one, achieving two main goals at the same time: on one hand, improving classification tasks; on the other hand, reducing dimensionality of the problem. Also, our method can handle classification and regression problems. We have tested our approach in two financial prediction problems because their high dimensionality is very appropriate for our method. In the first one, GP is used to tackle prediction of bankruptcy of companies (classification problem). In the second one, an IPO Underpricing prediction domain (a classical regression problem) is confronted. Our method obtained in both cases competitive results and, in addition, it drastically reduced dimensionality of the problem.

Our unsupervised approach uses an Expectation Maximization (EM) based clustering algorithm and the supervised approach uses the Naive Bayes classifier. We find the unsupervised clustering technique has an accuracy up to 91% and outperform the supervised technique by up to 9%. We also find that the unsupervised technique can be used to discover traffic from previously unknown applications and has the potential to become an excellent tool for exploring Internet traffic.

Recognition and classification of figures in PDF documents	GRAPHICS RECOGNITION: TEN YEARS REVIEW AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Graphic Recognition	AUG 25-26, 2005	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	City Univ Hong Kong, IAPR, K C Wong Educ Fdn, Hong Kong Web Soc		graphics recognition; PDF; graphemes; vector graphics; machine learning; boosting		Graphics recognition for raster-based input discovers primitives such as lines, arrowheads, and circles. This paper focuses on graphics recognition of figures in vector-based PDF documents. The first stage consists of extracting the graphic and text primitives corresponding to figures. An interpreter was constructed to translate PDF content into a set of self-contained graphics and text objects (in Java), freed from the intricacies of the PDF file. The second stage consists of discovering simple graphics entities which we call graphemes, e.g., a pair of primitive graphic objects satisfying certain geometric constraints. The third stage uses machine learning to classify figures using grapheme statistics as attributes. A boosting-based learner (LogitBoost in the Weka toolkit) was able to achieve 100 % classification accuracy in hold-out-one training/testing using 16 grapheme types extracted from 36 figures from BioMed Central journal research papers. The approach can readily be adapted to raster graphics recognition.

Currently, predictions are performed using two approaches: machine learning techniques and structural analysis. The latter often requires a large amount of computation in performing molecular simulations and post-process analysis. In this study, our objective is to create a vast number of hypothetical structural variations of HLA-peptide complexes. We present a prototype large-scale molecular modeling system to generate molecular structures that can then be used to determine binding efficiencies of HLA-peptide pairs. Understanding the binding potential of various epitopes allows us to suggest potential vaccine candidates for downstream validation. The system was implemented using Grid Services that embed functionalities of various software tools used for the molecular modeling of protein structures.

In this paper we study techniques for determining the state of an evolving collaborative process, while the activity is in progress, making the users aware of this state. For this reason, a State of Collaboration (SoC) indicator has been defined, which is calculated using a combination of machine-learning and statistical techniques. Subsequently a study was performed during which SoC was presented to a number of groups of collaborating partners engaged in problem-solving activities. It was found that this group awareness mechanism influenced in a significant way the behavior of the groups in which it was used. This study has wider implications to the design of groupware and in particular towards gaining an insight into the effect of group awareness mechanisms on computer-mediated collaborative learning.

Two of the three samples, POPGEN (n = 720) and SHIP (n = 709), are from north and north-east Germany, respectively, and one sample, KORA (n = 730), is from southern Germany. Methods: Population genetic differentiation was measured by classical F-statistics for different marker sets, either consisting of genome-wide selected coding SNPs located in functional genes, or consisting of selectively neutral SNPs from 'genomic deserts'. Quantitative estimates of the degree of stratification were performed comparing the genomic control approach [Devlin B, Roeder K: Biometrics 1999;55:997-1004], structured association [Pritchard JK, Stephens M, Donnelly P: Genetics 2000;155:945959] and sophisticated methods like random forests [Breiman L: Machine Learning 2001;45:5-32]. Results: F-statistics showed that there exists a low genetic differentiation between the samples along a north-south gradient within Germany (F-ST(KORA/POPGEN): 1.7 . 10(-4); F-ST(KORA/SHIP): 5.4 . 10(-4); F-ST(POPGEN/SHIP): -1.3 . 10(-5)). Conclusion: Although the F-ST-values are very small, indicating a minor degree of population structure, and are too low to be detectable from methods without using prior information of subpopulation membership, such as STRUCTURE [Pritchard JK, Stephens M, Donnelly P: Genetics 2000;155:945-959], they may be a possible source for confounding due to population stratification.

Recently large-scale classification problems in real world have attracted much attention where decomposition methods play an important role in solving SVMs. Although several decomposition algorithms have been applied in practice and proven to be convergent, the convergence speed is not easy to obtain which is important to analysis of different algorithms. The newly proposed algorithms based on rate certifying pair/set give us light to get the convergence speed in theory, but they suffer from high computational cost either due to more iterations to reach a tolerance of solution or to complexity in working set selection. A new simple decomposition algorithm based on a new philosophy is proposed in this paper. It has been proven that the working set selected by the new algorithm is a rate certifying set. Furthermore, compared with existing algorithms based on rate certifying pair/set, our algorithm provides a very good feature in combination of lower computational complexity in working set selection and faster convergence.

The context of negation, a negative finding, is of special importance, since many of the most frequently described findings are such. Hence, when searching free-text narratives for patients with a certain medical condition, if negation is not taken into account, many of the documents retrieved will be irrelevant. We present a new cascaded pattern learning method for automatic identification of negative context in clinical narratives reports. Studying the training corpuses, the classification errors and patterns selected by the classier; we noticed that it is possible to create a more powerful ensemble structure than the structure obtained from general-purpose ensemble method (such as Adaboost). We compare the new algorithm to previous methods proposed for the same task of similar medical narratives, and show its advantages: accuracy improvement compared to other machine learning methods, and much faster than manual knowledge engineering techniques with matching accuracy.

Sampling has often been suggested as an effective way to circumvent memory limitations as well as to improve processing speed. In this paper, we study the learning-curve sampling method, an approach for applying machine learning algorithms to massive amount of data sets. We show that a naive application of progressive sampling on data sets with highly imbalanced class distributions is often not very effective for training a learning algorithm. We then present a refinement for progressive sampling which works well in practice and is able to converge to the desired sample size very quickly and accurately. Empirical results on a number of large data sets show that our approach is able to enhance its performance.

One of the most important mining tasks is clustering. Clustering has attracted extensive research by both the community of machine learning and data mining. Many stream clustering methods have been proposed. These methods have proven to be efficient on specific problems. However, most of there methods are on continuous clustering and few of them care about to solve the heterogeneous clustering problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the CluStream framework for clustering data stream with heterogeneous features. The centroid of continuous attributes and the histogram of the discrete attributes are used to represent the Micro clusters, and k-prototype clustering algorithm is used to create the Micro clusters and Macro clusters. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show its efficiency.

The answer is obviously not. If not, when can we trust the discovery then? What are the factors that affect the reliability of the discovery? How do they affect the reliability of the discovery? These are some interesting questions to be investigated. In this paper we will firstly provide a definition and the measurements of reliability, and analyse the factors that affect the reliability. We then examine the impact of model complexity, weak links, varying sample sizes and the ability of different learners to the reliability of graphical model discovery. The experimental results reveal that (1) the larger sample size for the discovery, the higher reliability we will get; (2) the stronger a graph link is, the easier the discovery will be and thus the higher the reliability it can achieve; (3) the complexity of a graph also plays an important role in the discovery. The higher the complexity of a graph is, the more difficult to induce the graph and the lower reliability it would be.

Intrusion detection, which aims at identifying and predicting network attacks, is a fast developing area that has attracted attention from both industry and academia. Technologies have been developed to detect network intrusions using theories and methods from statistics, machine learning, soft computing, mathematics, and many other fields. We have previously proposed multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and multiple criteria nonlinear programming (MCNP) models for two-group intrusion detection. Although these models achieve good results in two-group classification problems, they perform poorly on multi-group situations. In order to solve the problem, we introduce the kernel concept into multiple criteria models in this paper. Experimental results show that the new model provides both high classification accuracies and low false alarm rates in three-group and four-group intrusion detection.

However traditional clustering methods concentrate on producing a single solution, even though multiple alternative clusterings may exist. It is thus difficult for the user to validate whether the given solution is in fact appropriate, particularly for large and complex datasets. In this paper we explore the critical requirements for systematically finding a new clustering, given that an already known clustering is available and we also propose a novel algorithm, COALA, to discover this new clustering. Our approach is driven by two important factors; dissimilarity and quality. These are especially important for finding a new clustering which is highly informative about the underlying structure of data, but is at the same time distinctively different from the provided clustering.

The goal is then to judiciously choose which examples in U to have labeled in order to optimize some performance criterion, e.g. classification accuracy. We study how active learning affects AUC We examine two existing algorithms from the literature and present our own active learning algorithms designed to maximize the AUC of the hypothesis. One of our algorithms was consistently the top performer, and Closest Sampling from the literature often came in second behind it. When good posterior probability estimates were available, our heuristics were by far the best.

On the lower bound of local optimums in K-means algorithm	ICDM 2006: SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				The k-means algorithm is a popular clustering method used in many different fields of computer science, such as data mining, machine learning and information retrieval. However the k-means algorithm is very likely to converge to some local optimum which is much worse than the desired global optimal solution. To overcome this problem, current k-means algorithm and its variants usually run many times with different initial centers to avoid being trapped in local optimums that are of unacceptable quality. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to compute a lower bound on the cost of the local optimum from the current center set. After every k-means iteration, k-means algorithm can halt the procedure if the lower bound of the cost at the future local optimum is worse than the best solution that has already been computed so far Although such a lower bound computation incurs some extra time consumption in the iterations, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that this method can greatly prune the unnecessary iterations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm in most of the data sets, especially with high dimensionality and large k.

Often, the exact structure of the patterns of interest is not known. This happens, for example, when molecular structures are mined to discover fragments useful as features in chemical compound classification task, or when web sites are mined to discover sets of web pages representing logical documents. Such patterns are often generated from a few small subgraphs (cores), according to certain generalization rules (GRs). We call such patterns "generalized patterns" (GPs). While being structurally different, GPs often perform the same function in the network. Previously proposed approaches to mining GPs either assumed that the cores and the GRs are given, or that all interesting GPs are frequent. These are strong assumptions, which often do not hold in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an approach to mining GPs that is free from the above assumptions. Given a small number of GPs selected by the user, our algorithm discovers all GPs similar to the user examples. First, a machine learning-style approach is used to find the cores. Second, generalizations of the cores in the graph are computed to identify GPs. Evaluation on synthetic data, generated using real cores and GRs from biological and web domains, demonstrates effectiveness of our approach.

Other more heuristic methods seek to utilize more general features, with some degree of success. In this paper, we present a data mining approach that conducts an exhaustive feature search on a set of computer viruses and strives to obviate over-fitting. We also evaluate the predictive power of a classifier by taking into account dependence relationships that exist between viruses, and we show that our classifier yields high detection rates and can be expected to perform as well in real-world conditions.

This algorithm constructs artificial datasets that are diverse with the current training dataset in terms of ranking. We conduct experiments with real-world data sets to compare RankDE with some traditional and state-of-the-art ensembling algorithms of Bagging, Adaboost, DECORATE and Rankboost in terms of ranking. The experiments show that RankDE outperforms Bagging, DECORATE, Adaboost, and Rankboost when limited data is available. When enough training data is available, it is competitive with DECORATE and Adaboost.

A vital consideration in obtaining good results with this technique is the choice of distance function, and correspondingly which features to consider when computing distances between samples. In this paper a new ensemble technique is proposed to improve the performance of NN classifier The proposed approach combines multiple NN classifiers, where each classifier uses a different distance function and potentially a different set of features (feature vector). These feature vectors are determined for each distance metric using Simple Voting Scheme incorporated in Tabu Search (TS). The proposed ensemble classifier with different distance metrics and different feature vectors (TS-DF/NN) is evaluated using various benchmark data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Results have indicated a significant increase in the performance when compared with various well-known classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed ensemble method is also compared with ensemble classifier using different distance metrics but with same feature vector (with or without Feature Selection (FS)).

Many different semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed to tackle this difficulty by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data. However, most Of them focus on semi-supervised classification. In this paper we propose a semi-supervised regression algorithm named Semi-Supervised Kernel Regression (SSKR). While classical kernel regression is only based on labeled examples, our approach extends it to all observed examples using a weighting factor to modulate the effect of unlabeled examples. Experimental results prove that SSKR significantly outperforms traditional kernel regression and graph-based semi-supervised regression methods.

In this work, these interactions are viewed as a cooperative game (from the idea of two-person game theory, nonzerosum game), where the players try to reach an agreement about a certain negotiation object that is offered by one player to another. The final agreement is assumed to be satisfactory to both parts. To achieve effectively this goal, we modelled each player as a multi-agent system with its respective environment. In doing so, we aim at providing an effective means to collect relevant information to help agents to make good decisions, that is, how to choose the "best way to play" among a set of alternatives. Then we define a mechanism to model the opponent player and other mechanisms for monitoring relevant variables from the player' environment. Also, we maintain the context of the current game and keep the most relevant information of previous games. Additionally, we integrate all the information to be used in the refinement of the game strategies governing the multi-agent system.

However, a low percentage of women who suffer it can be detected using mammography methods. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new strategies to detect its formation in early stages. Many machine learning techniques have been applied in order to help doctors in the diagnosis decision process, but its definition and application are complex, getting results which are not often the desired. In this article we present an automatic way to build decision support systems by means of the combination of several machine learning techniques using a Meta-learning approach based on Grammar Evolution (MGE). We will study its application over different mammographic datasets to assess the improvement of the results.

Databases containing free-text clinical narratives reports often need to be retrieved to find relevant information for clinical and research purposes. Terms that appear in these documents tend to appear in different contexts. The context of negation, a negative finding, is of special importance, since many of the most frequently described findings are those denied by the patient or subsequently "ruled out." Hence, when searching free-text narratives for patients with a certain medical condition, if negation is not taken into account, many of the documents retrieved will be irrelevant. In this paper we examine the applicability of machine learning methods for automatic identification of negative context patterns in clinical narratives reports. We suggest two new simple algorithms and compare their performance with standard machine learning techniques such as neural networks and decision trees. The proposed algorithms significantly improve the performance of information retrieval done on medical narratives.

This paper presents a machine learning approach to allocate parallel workload in a cost-aware manner. This instance-based learning approach uses static program features to classify programs, before deciding the best workload allocation scheme based on its prior experience with similar programs. Experimental results on 76 Java benchmarks show that it can find the optimal workload allocation schemes for 36 out of them and over 85% of the best speedups on the other 19. It shows that this approach can efficiently allocate parallel workload among Java threads and achieve optimal or suboptimal performance.

This paper presents a genetic-based approach for finding symbolic formulas for transforming coordinate signals received from GPS. In this way, the receiver's position can be obtained much faster with less computational complexity. We test this concept on different areas in Taiwan and find several new equations that can effectively and better produce accurate coordinates.

But the weakness such as the poor performance in classification and the high dependence on the statistical knowledge of the pre-experimentation is unconquerable. So we introduce the Support Vector Machine which is a powerful machine-learning scheme and has been used in the classifiers of the multidimensional non-linear successfully. In this paper, we present a speech recognition system based on the hybrid HMM/SVM architecture. Additional, several issues that arise as a result of the hybrid framework have been addressed, including estimation of posterior probability and the use of segment-level data.. Having been proved in the experiment, the hybrid system has combined the predominance of both HMM and SVM and has a better performance than traditional one.

However, such directories are generally constructed manually and have disadvantages of narrow coverage and inconsistency. In this work, we propose a machine learning approach that automatically constructs a navigational structure for the WWW to help information finding. A self-organizing map is constructed to train the web pages and obtain two feature maps, which reveal the relationships among web pages and thematic keywords respectively. We then use these maps to develop a structure that may assist the users finding the information they need. We used a small set of web pages in the experiments and obtained promising result.

Most existing Web search tools work only with individual users and do not help a user benefit from previous search experience of others. In this paper, a collaborative Web Mining System, Collector Engine System is presented, a multiagent system designed to provide post-retrieval analysis and enable across-user collaboration in web search and mining. This system allows the user to annotate search sessions and share them with other users. The prototype system and component of Collector Engine System is discussed and described, and especially designs the web Agent, the knowledge discovery of web Agent is extracted based on a combination of web usage mining and machine learning. The system model is established and realized by J2EE technology. The system's application shows that subjects' search performance is degraded, compared to individual search scenarios, in which users have no access to previous searches, when they have access to a limited of earlier search session done by other users.

In this paper, we present a machine learning based shot detection approach using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), in which both the color and shape clues are utilized. Its advantages are twofold. First, the temporal characteristics of different shot transitions are exploited and an HMM is constructed for each type of shot transitions, including cut and gradual transitions. As trained HMMs are used to recognize the shot transition patterns automatically, it does not suffer from any trouble of threshold selection problem.

The former summarizes the shape well whereas the latter summarizes the appearance well. Experimental results on a set of test videos demonstrate the efficacy of this shot detection approach.

As many as 106 datasets from the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository were used as comparison benchmarks. The framework provides a clear definition of the experimental setup so that it can be unambiguously reproduced or verified by others. Multiple runs of cross-validation and tuning were employed to minimize the possibility of random effects causing much biases in the results obtained. The metrics used to compare among different classifiers are based solely on simple readings obtained through classification tests. This allows future comparisons to be made readily adaptable for inclusion of new metrics.

And based on this new method, the interharmonic detection system is designed and implemented with the prevailing and powerful software platform of LabVIEW with graphical nature.

End milling is one of the most commonly used cutting operations to produce surfaces with various profiles. The quality of the manufactured parts not only depends on their geometries but also surfaces texture such as roughness. Several factors such as feed rate, spindle speed, depth of cut, tool geometry, tool wear, and properties of both tool and workpiece influence roughness. Only some of them can be controlled in advance. The selection of cutting parameters which control surface finish is traditionally conducted by trial and error, experience, and machining handbooks. This results in conservative cutting condition which in turn may compromise part quality and/or efficiency of the end milling operation. To achieve a desirable roughness, the procedure is normally repeated with different sets of cutting condition. Such empirical process is time consuming. The formation of roughness is very complicated and process dependent. Thus, analytical approach for its modeling is very difficult due to high nonlinearity nature. A well generalization machine learning technique called support vector machine is used to learn from abundant experimental data and capture characteristics of roughness and its parameters so that it can accurately predict the surface finish.

Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is a method of solving this problem by using a partially observable Markov decision process to find the robot's state based on its sensor readings, given a static map of the environment. MCL requires a model of each sensor in order to work properly. One of the most important sensors involved is the estimation of the robot's motion, based on its encoders that report what motion the robot has performed. Since these encoders are inaccurate, MCL involves using other sensors to correct the robot's location. Usually, a motion model is created that predicts the robot's actual motion, given a reported motion. The parameters of this model must be determined manually using exhaustive tests. Although an accurate motion model can be determined in advance, a single model cannot optimally represent a robot's motion in all cases. With a terrestrial robot the ground surface, slope, motor wear, and possibly tire inflation level will all alter the characteristics of the motion model. Thus, it is necessary to have a generalized model with enough error to compensate for all possible situations. However, if the localization algorithm is working properly, the result is a series of predicted motions, together with the corrections determined by the algorithm that alter the motions to the correct location. In this case, we demonstrate a technique to process these motions and corrections and dynamically determine revised motion parameters that more accurately reflect the robot's motion. We also link these parameters to different locations so that area dependent conditions, such as surface changes, can be taken into account. These parameters might even be used to identify surface changes by examining the various parameters. By using the fact that MCL is working, we have improved the algorithm to adapt to changing conditions so as to handle even more complex situations.

This approach to goal coordination is a novel tool to incorporate a deep coordination ability to pure reactive agents. The framework is based on the notion of multi-objective optimization. We propose a kind of "aggregating functions" formulation with the particularity that the aggregation is weighted by means of a dynamic weighting unitary vector (omega) over right arrow (S) which is dependant on the system dynamic state allowing the agent to dynamically coordinate the priorities of its single goals. This dynamic weighting unitary vector is represented as a set of n-1 angles. The dynamic coordination must be established by means of a mapping between the state of the agent's environment S to the set of angles Phi i(S) using any sort of machine learning tool. In this work we investigate the use of Reinforcement Learning as a first approach to learn that mapping.

The literature is abound with motif search methods. But as the motifs of a promoter are consensus patterns of very short length and the chance of finding putative promoters is high, global feature methods gain importance. In this paper a simple global feature extraction method is proposed for the recognition of sigma-70 promoters in E.coli. It is shown that a simple feedforward neural network classifier achieves a precision of nearly 80% in contrast to the high end classifiers and heavy features proposed in the literature achieving a similar performance. Additionally, a scheme is proposed for locating promoter regions in a given DNA segment.

Basically, given a training data set, this technique estimates a function where its value is calculated using the distance between points and two sets of straight line segments. A training algorithm has been developed to find these sets of straight line segments that minimizes the mean square error. This technique has been applied on two real pattern recognition problems: (1) breast cancer data set to classify tumors as benign or malignant; (2) wine data set to classify wines in one of the three different cultivators from which they could be derived. This technique was also tested with two artificial data sets in order to show its ability to solve approximation function problems. The obtained results show that this technique has a good performance in all of these problems and they indicate that it is a good candidate to be used in Machine Learning applications.

Most of the existing solutions for the problem only use image processing methods to identify a horizon line in an image. This results in good accuracy for many cases and is fast in computation. However, for some images with difficult environmental conditions like a foggy or cloudy sky these image processing methods are inherently inaccurate in identifidng the correct horizon. This paper investigates how to detect the horizon line in a set of images using a machine learning approach. The performance of the SVM, J48, and Naive Bayes classifiers, used for the problem, has been compared Accuracy of 90-99% in identifying horizon was achieved on image data set of 20 images.

The study focuses on short-handed small stakes Texas Hold'em, and the data set used contains 105 human players, each having played more than 500 hands. Techniques used are decision trees and G-REX a rule extractor based on genetic programming. The overall result is that the rules induced are rather compact and have very high accuracy, thus providing good explanations of successful play. It is of course quite hard to assess the quality of the rules; i.e. if they provide something novel and non-trivial. The main picture is, however, that obtained rules are consistent with established poker theory. With this in mind, we believe that the suggested techniques will in future studies, where substantially more data is available, produce clear and accurate descriptions of what constitutes the difference between winning and losing in poker.

In addition to classic p-norm distance, numerous other distance measures exist and the most popular is Dynamic Time Warping. Here we propose a new distance measure, called Adaptable Time Warping (ATW), which generalizes all previous time warping distances. We present a learning process using a genetic algorithm that adapts ATW in a locally optimal way, according to the current classification issue we have to resolve. It's possible to prove that ATW with optimal parameters is at least equivalent or at best superior to the other time warping distances for all classification problems. We show this assertion by performing comparative tests on two real datasets. The originality of this work is that we propose a whole learning process directly based on the distance measure rather than on the time series themselves.

TF-ICF: A new term weighting scheme for clustering dynamic data streams	ICMLA 2006: 5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 14-16, 2006	Orlando, FL	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Armstrong Atlantic State Univ, Florida Int Univ, IEEE, Univ Louisville				In this paper, we propose a new term weighting scheme called Term Frequency - Inverse Corpus Frequency (TF-ICF). It does not require term frequency information from other documents within the document collection and thus, it enables us to generate the document vectors of N streaming documents in linear time. In the context of a machine learning application, unsupervised document clustering, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to five widely used term weighting schemes through extensive experimentation. Our results show that TF-ICF can produce document clusters that are of comparable quality as those generated by the widely recognized term weighting schemes and it is significantly faster than those methods.

If the objective is fault detection, an inappropriate execution order might reveal most faults late, thus delaying the bug fixing activity and eventually the delivery of the software. Prioritizing the test cases so as to optimize the achievement of the testing goal has potentially a positive impact on the testing costs, especially when the test execution time is long. Test engineers often possess relevant knowledge about the relative priority of the test cases. However this knowledge can be hardly expressed in the form of a global ranking or scoring. In this paper, we propose a test case prioritization technique that takes advantage of user knowledge through a machine learning algorithm, Case-Based Ranking (CBR). CBR elicits just relative priority information from the user, in the form of pair wise test case comparisons. User input is integrated with multiple prioritization indexes, in an iterative process that successively refines the test case ordering. Preliminary results on a case study indicate that CBR overcomes previous approaches and, for moderate suite size, gets very close to the optimal solution.

LEM's main novelties are operators for creating new individuals that include hypothesis generation, which learns rules indicating subareas in the search space likely containing the optimum, and hypothesis instantiation, which populates these subareas with new candidate solutions. LEM3, the newest and most advanced implementation of learnable evolution, is briefly described and experimentally compared with other evolutionary computation programs on selected function optimization problems. We also describe two specialized LEM-based systems for heat exchanger optimization.

They are fundamental to plan test activities and to ensure the quality of the software being developed. Two kind of models are generally used: time or test coverage based models. In our previous work, we successfully explored Genetic Programming (GP) to derive reliability models. However, nowadays Boosting techniques (BT) have been successfully applied with other Machine Learning techniques, including GP. BT merge several hypotheses of the training set to get better results. With the goal of improving the GP software reliability models, this work explores the combination GP and BT The results show advantages in the use of the proposed approach.

There are a number of shortcomings of such value-neutral software engineering. Value-based software engineering is to integrate value considerations into the full range of existing and emerging software engineering principles and practices. Machine learning has been playing an increasingly important role in helping develop and maintain large and complex software systems. However, machine learning applications to software engineering have been largely confined to the value-neutral software engineering setting. In this paper, we advocate a shift to applying machine learning methods to value-based software engineering. We propose a framework for value-based software test data generation. The proposed framework incorporates some general principles in value-based software testing and can help improve return on investment.

In this paper, we empirically study traditional decision-tree learning models and their variants in terms of probability estimation, measured by Conditional Log Likelihood (CLL). Furthermore, we also compare decision tree learning with other kinds of representative learning: naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Tree, Bayesian Network, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine with respect to probability estimation. From our experiments, we have several interesting observations. First, among various decision-tree learning models, C4.4 is the best in yielding precise probability estimation measured by CLL, although its performance is not good in terms of other evaluation criteria, such as accuracy and ranking. We provide an explanation for this and reveal the nature of CLL. Second, compared with other popular models, C4.4 achieves the best CLL. Finally CLL does not dominate another well-established relevant measurement AUC (the Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristics), which suggests that different decision-tree learning models should be used for different objectives. Our experiments are conducted on the basis of 36 UCI sample sets that cover a wide range of domains and data characteristics. We run all the models within a machine learning platform - Weka.

Generally, the problem is known in the literature as the vehicle motion planning. In this paper the behavioural cloning approach is applied to design the vehicle controller. In behavioural cloning, the system learns from control traces of a human operator. To learn from control traces the machine learning algorithm and neural network algorithms are used. The goal is to find the controller for the autonomous vehicle motion planning in situation with infinite number of obstacles.

In contrast, we instead dynamically select among a set of DPM policies with a machine learning algorithm. We leverage the fact that different policies outperform each other under different workloads and devices. Our algorithm adapts to changes in workloads and guarantees quick convergence to the best performing policy for each workload. We performed experiments with a policy set representing state of the art DPM policies on a hard disk drive and a WLAN card. Our results show that our algorithm adapts really well with changing device and workload characteristics and achieves an overall performance comparable to the best performing policy at any point of time.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is often used for strategy learning in RoboCup, which is a method to learn an optimal control policy for sequential decision-making problems. But it is difficult to apply RL, to continuous state space problems because of the exponential growth of states in the number of state variables. An effective method is to combine RL with function approximation. However, this combination sometimes leads to diverge. In this paper, we analyze the main reason that cause the non-convergent of the current approximation RL algorithms and propose an optimal strategy learning method. The two processes - value evaluation and policy improvement in RL have been separated. Policy search process is controlled strictly in the direction of improving performance according the evaluation value provided by the value function. And we apply this algorithm to a standard RoboCup sub-problem-Keepaway successfully. Experiment result has verified the effective of the method and showed the algorithm could converge to a local optimal policy.

First, the image is decomposed by wavelet, and then the texture characteristic of text is extracted by using SVM on low-frequency approximate sub-space and high-frequency energy sub-space. Combining wavelet transform and SVM not only reduces the number of input training samples but also accelerates the speed of SVM for learning and classification. This method utilizes the characteristic that SVM is suited to high-dimension space work and improves the efficiency of extracting text. Experimental results show that the current proposed method can correctly and effectively locate text region in the digital image.

A machine learning approach to differentiating bacterial from viral meningitis	IEEE John Vincent Atanasoff 2006 International Symposium on Modern Computing, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE John Vincent Atanasoff International Symposium on Modern Computing	OCT 03-06, 2006	Sofia, BULGARIA	IEEE Comp Soc		automated diagnosis; meningitis; probabilistic neural networks; and rough sets	CHILDREN; MODEL	Clinical reports indicate that differentiating bacterial from viral (aseptic) meningitis is still a difficult issue, compounded by factors such as age and time of presentation. Clinicians routinely rely on the results from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to discriminate bacterial from viral meningitis. Tests such as the CSF Gram stain performed prior to broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment yield sensitivities between 60 and 92%. Sensitivity can be increased by performing additional laboratory testing, but the results are never completely accurate and are not cost effective in many cases. In this study, we wished to determine if a machine learning approach, based on rough sets and a probabilistic neural network could be used to differentiate between viral and bacterial meningitis. We analysed a clinical dataset containing records for 581 cases of acute bacterial or viral meningitis. The rough sets approach was used to perform dimensionality reduction in addition to classification. The results were validated using a probabilistic neural network. With an overall accuracy of 98%, these results indicate rough sets is a useful approach to differentiating bacterial from viral meningitis.

The strength of our approach is that it,does not require prior musical source separation. Thanks to a hierarchical clustering algorithm exploiting robust probabilistic distances,. we obtain a taxonomy of musical ensembles which is used to efficiently classify possible combinations of instruments played simultaneously. Moreover, a wide set of acoustic features is studied including some new proposals. In particular, signal to mask ratios are found to be useful features for audio classification. This study focuses on a single music genre (i.e., jazz) but combines a variety of instruments among which are percussion and singing voice. Using a varied database of sound excerpts from commercial recordings, we show that the segmentation of music with respect to the instruments played can be achieved with an average accuracy of 53%.

Over the past decade, a variety of practical goal-oriented spoken dialog systems have been built for limited domains. SLU in these systems ranges from understanding predetermined phrases through fixed grammars, extracting some predefined named entities, extracting users' intents for call classification, to combinations of users' intents and named entities. In this paper, we present the SLU system of VoiceTone((R)) (a service provided by AT&T where AT&T develops, deploys and hosts spoken dialog applications for enterprise customers). The SLU system includes extracting both intents and the named entities from the users' utterances. For intent determination, we use statistical classifiers trained from labeled data, and for named entity extraction we use rule-based fixed grammars. The focus of our work is to exploit data and to use machine learning techniques to create scalable SLU systems which can be quickly deployed for new domains with minimal human intervention. These objectives are achieved by 1) using the predicate-argument representation of semantic content of an utterance; 2) extending statistical classifiers to seamlessly integrate hand crafted classification rules with the rules learned from data; and 3) developing an active learning framework to minimize the human labeling effort for quickly building the classifier models and adapting them to changes. We present an evaluation of this system using two deployed applications of VoiceTone((R)).

The ability to delineate geologic facies and to estimate their properties from sparse data is essential for modeling physical and biochemical processes occurring in the subsurface. We demonstrate that the support vector machine is a viable and efficient tool for lithofacies delineation, and we compare it with a geostatistical approach. To illustrate our approach, and to demonstrate its advantages, we construct a synthetic porous medium consisting of two heterogeneous materials and then estimate boundaries between these materials from a few selected data points. Our analysis shows that the error in facies delineation by means of support vector machines decreases logarithmically with increasing sampling density. We also introduce and analyze the use of regression support vector machines to estimate the parameter values between points where the parameter is sampled.

Scoliosis is a condition that involves abnormal lateral curvature and rotation of the spine that usually causes noticeable trunk deformities. Based on the hypothesis that combining surface topography and clinical data using a SVM would produce better assessment results, we conducted a study using a dataset of 111 IS patients. Twelve surface and clinical indicators were obtained for each patient. The result of testing on the dataset showed that. the system achieved 69-85% accuracy in testing. It outperformed a linear discriminant function classifier and a decision tree classifier on the dataset.

J	Zhou, ZH; Liu, XY				Zhou, ZH; Liu, XY			Training cost-sensitive neural networks with methods addressing the class imbalance problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						machine learning; data mining; neural networks; cost-sensitive learning; class imbalance learning; sampling; threshold-moving; ensemble learning		This paper studies empirically the effect of sampling and threshold-moving in training cost-sensitive neural networks. Both oversampling and undersampling are considered. These techniques modify the distribution of the training data such that the costs of the examples are conveyed explicitly by the appearances of the examples. Threshold-moving tries to move the output threshold toward inexpensive classes such that examples with higher costs become harder to be misclassified. Moreover, hard-ensemble and soft-ensemble, i.e., the combination of above techniques via hard or soft voting schemes, are also tested. Twenty-one UCI data sets with three types of cost matrices and a real-world cost-sensitive data set are used in the empirical study. The results suggest that cost-sensitive learning with multiclass tasks is more difficult than with two-class tasks, and a higher degree of class imbalance may increase the difficulty. It also reveals that almost all the techniques are effective on two-class tasks, while most are ineffective and even may cause negative effect on multiclass tasks. Overall, threshold-moving and soft-ensemble are relatively good choices in training cost-sensitive neural networks. The empirical study also suggests that some methods that have been believed to be effective in addressing the class imbalance problem may, in fact, only be effective on learning with imbalanced two-class data sets.

J	Lu, JW; Plataniotis, KN; Venetsanopoulos, AN; Li, SZ				Lu, JW; Plataniotis, KN; Venetsanopoulos, AN; Li, SZ			Ensemble-based discriminant learning with boosting for face recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						boosting; face recognition (FR); linear discriminant analysis; machine learning; mixture of linear models; small-sample-size (SSS) problem; strong learner	SAMPLE-SIZE PROBLEM; ALGORITHMS; KERNEL; CLASSIFIERS; REDUCTION; SUBSPACES	In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble-based approach to boost performance of traditional Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)-based methods used in face recognition. The ensemble-based approach is based on the recently emerged technique known as "boosting:' However, it is generally believed that boosting-like learning rules are not suited to a strong and stable learner such as LDA. To break the limitation, a novel weakness analysis theory is developed here. The theory attempts to boost a strong learner by increasing the diversity between the classifiers created by the learner, at the expense of decreasing their margins 9 so as to achieve a tradeoff suggested by recent boosting studies for a low generalization error. In addition, a novel distribution accounting for the pairwise class discriminant information is introduced for effective interaction between the booster and the LDA-based learner. The integration of all these methodologies proposed here leads to the novel ensemble-based discriminant learning approach, capable of taking advantage of both the boosting and LDA techniques. Promising experimental results obtained on various difficult face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We believe that this work is especially beneficial in extending the boosting framework to accommodate general (strong/weak) learners.

J	Agarwal, A; Triggs, B				Agarwal, A; Triggs, B			Recovering 3D human pose from monocular images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						computer vision; human motion estimation; machine learning; multivariate regression		We describe a learning-based method for recovering 3D human body pose from single images and monocular image sequences. Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6 degrees are obtained for a variety of walking motions.

J	Zheng, J; Hu, MZ				Zheng, J; Hu, MZ			An anomaly intrusion detection system based on vector quantization	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						anomaly intrusion detection; usage profile; vector quantization; codebook; quantization error	COMPUTER	Machine learning and data mining algorithms are increasingly being used in the intrusion detection systems (IDS), but their performances are laggard to some extent especially applied in network based intrusion detection: the larger load of network traffic monitoring requires more efficient algorithm in practice. In this paper, we propose and design an anomaly intrusion detection (AID) system based on the vector quantization (VQ) which is widely used for data compression and high-dimension multimedia data index. The design procedure optimizes the performance of intrusion detection by jointly accounting for accurate usage profile modeling by the VQ codebook and fast similarity measures between feature vectors to reduce the computational cost. The former is just the key of getting high detection rate and the later is the footstone of guaranteeing efficiency and real-time style of intrusion detection. Experiment comparisons to other related researches show that the performance of intrusion detection is improved greatly.

Usually, misclassification rates are not uniformly distributed in off-diagonal elements of the matrix. Some categories are easily classified from the others, and some are not. The loss function used by AdaBoost ignores the difference. If we derive a classifier which is efficient to classify categories close to the remaining categories, the overall accuracy may be improved. In this paper, the exponential loss function with different costs for misclassification is proposed in multiclass problems. Costs due to misclassification should be pre-assigned. Then, we obtain an emprical cost risk function to be minimized, and the minimizing procedure is established (Cost AdaBoost). Similar treatments for logit loss functions are discussed. Also, Spatial Cost AdaBoost is proposed. Out purpose is originally to minimize the expected cost. If we can define costs appropriately, the costs are useful for reducing error rates. A simple numerical example shows that the proposed method is useful for reducing error rates.

Annotating news video with locations	IMAGE AND VIDEO RETRIEVAL, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval (CIVR 2006	JUL 13-15, 2006	Tempe, AZ		Arizona State Univ			The location of video scenes is an important semantic descriptor especially for broadcast news video. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach to annotate shots of news video with locations extracted from. video transcript, based on features from,multiple video modalities including syntactic structure of transcript sentences, speaker identity, temporal video structure, and so on. Machine learning algorithms are adopted to combine multi-modal features to solve two sub-problems: (1) whether the location of a video shot is mentioned in the transcript, and if so, (2) among many locations in the transcript, which are correct one(s) for this shot. Experiments on TRECVID dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves approximately 85% accuracy in correctly labeling the location of any shot in news video.

We use class-specific keywords in an image search engine to create a noisily labeled training corpus of images for each class. NPIC then extracts both content-based image retrieval (CBIR) features and metadata-based textual features for each image for machine learning. We evaluate this approach on three different granularities: 1) natural vs. synthetic, 2) map vs. figure vs. icon vs. cartoon vs. artwork 3) and further subclasses of the map and figure classes. The NPIC framework achieves solid performance (99%, 97% and 85% in cross validation, respectively). We find that visual features provide a significant boost in performance, and that textual and visual features vary in usefulness at the different levels of granularities of classification.

Feature selection is of great importance in pattern classification, medical data processing, machine learning, and data mining applications. Therefore, a good feature selection method based on the number of features investigated for sample classification is needed in order to speed up the processing rate, predictive accuracy, and to avoid incomprehensibility. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machines (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for the classification problem. The proposed method is applied to five classification problems from the literature. Experimental results show that our method simplifies features effectively and obtains a higher classification accuracy compared to the other feature selection methods.

Despite the growing awareness of the importance of such measures, they are rarely considered in biomedical simulation. This study introduces an input generator for soft data (input generator SD) that makes soft data applicable to simulation. Materials and Methods: Machine learning approaches and standard regression techniques were applied to simulate odour intensity ratings. Results: The performance of all the applied methods was satisfactory and the results can be used to modify systems biological mathematical models. Conclusion: Soft data should no longer be discounted in systems biological simulations. Exemplarily, it can be demonstrated that the input generator SD produces results that are similar to those that the simulated system can generate. Machine learning and/or appropriate conventional mathematical approaches may be applied to simulate non-crisp processes that can be used to modify mathematical models of any granularity.

However, only one percent of them are caused by a congenital heart defect; others are physiological. Auscultation of the heart is still the primary diagnostic tool for judging the type of cardiac murmur. An automated system for an initial recording and analysis of the cardiac sounds could enable the primary care physicians to make the initial diagnosis and thus decrease the workload of the specialised health care system. The first step in any automated murmur classifier is the identification of different components of cardiac cycle and separation of the murmurs. Here we propose a new methodological framework to address this issue from a machine learning perspective, combining Independent Component Analysis and Denoising Source Separation. We show that such a method is rather efficient in the separation of cardiac murmurs. The framework is equally capable of separating heart sounds S1 and S2 and artifacts such as voices recorded during the measurements.

However, the generalization of decision support systems (DSS) is still far away from everyday use by managers and academicians. This paper aims to present a framework of analysis based on Bayesian networks (BN) whose accuracy is measured in order to assess scientific evidence. Design/methodology/approach - Different learning algorithms based on BN are applied to extract relevant information about the relationship between operations strategy and flexibility in a sample of engineering consulting firms. Feature selection algorithms automatically are able to improve the accuracy of these classifiers. Findings - Results show that the behaviors of the firms can be reduced to different rules that help in the decision-making process about investments in technology and production resources. Originality/value - Contrasting with methods from the classic statistics, Bayesian classifiers are able to model a variety of relationships between the variables affecting the dependent variable. Contrasting with other methods from the artificial intelligence field, such as neural networks or support vector machines, Bayesian classifiers are white-box models that can directly be interpreted. Together with feature selection techniques from the machine learning field, they are able to automatically learn a model that accurately fits the data.

In contrast to conventional Darwinian type evolutionary computation algorithm that uses various forms of mutation and/or recombination operators, LEM uses machine learning to guide the process of generating new individuals. It employs the AQ learning to generate hypotheses discriminating between groups of high and low fitness individuals, and then uses these hypotheses to generate new individuals. On the other hand pattern search is a class of direct search for derivative-free optimization with accurately established global convergence properties. Pattern search makes no use of derivative information, which might be unavailable, too expensive, o r misleading. This paper focuses on measuring the performance of LEM3 and pattern search from the point of view of execution time in experiments on optimizing the Rastrigin function with different number of variables.

J	Lee, CK; Lee, GG				Lee, CK; Lee, GG			Information gain and divergence-based feature selection for machine learning-based text categorization	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						text categorization; feature selection; information gain and divergence-based feature selection		Most previous works of feature selection emphasized only the reduction of high dimensionality of the feature space. But in cases where many features are highly redundant with each other, we must utilize other means, for example, more complex dependence models such as Bayesian network classifiers. In this paper, we introduce a new information gain and divergence-based feature selection method for statistical machine learning-based text categorization without relying on more complex dependence models. Our feature selection method strives to reduce redundancy between features while maintaining information gain in selecting appropriate features for text categorization. Empirical results are given on a number of dataset, showing that our feature selection method is more effective than Koller and Sahami's method [Koller, D., & Sahami, M. (1996). Toward optimal feature selection. In Proceedings of ICML-96, 13th international conference on machine learning], which is one of greedy feature selection methods, and conventional information gain which is commonly used in feature selection for text categorization. Moreover, our feature selection method sometimes produces more improvements of conventional machine learning algorithms over support vector machines which are known to give the best classification accuracy.

The goal is to make the final ranked list of documents accurately represent users' preferences reflected in the click-through data. Our approach combines the ranking result of a traditional IR algorithm (BM25) with that given by a machine learning algorithm (Naive Bayes). The machine learning algorithm is trained on click-through data (queries and their associated documents), while the IR algorithm runs over the document collection. We consider several alternative strategies for combining the result of using click-through data and that of using document data. Experimental results confirm that any method of using click-through data greatly improves the preference ranking, over the method of using BM25 alone. We found that a linear combination of scores of Naive Bayes and scores of BM25 performs the best for the task. At the same time, we found that the preference ranking methods can preserve relevance ranking, i.e., the preference ranking methods can perform as well as BM25 for relevance ranking.

However, these techniques heavily depend on the availability of large amounts of training data, and may suffer many difficulties while facing various new questions from the real users on the Web. To mitigate the problem of lacking sufficient training data, in this paper, we present a simple learning method that explores Web search results to collect more training data automatically by a few seed terms (question answers). In addition, we propose a novel semantically related feature model (SRFM), which takes advantage of question focuses and their semantically related features learned from the larger number of collected training data to support the determination of question type. Our experimental results show that the proposed new learning method can obtain better classification performance than the bigram language modeling (LM) approach for the questions with untrained question focuses.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one such algorithm based on swarm intelligence and is derived from a model inspired by the collective foraging behavior of ants. Taking advantage of the ACO in traits such as self-organization and robustness, this paper proposes a novel document clustering approach based on ACO. Unlike other ACO-based clustering approaches which are based on the same scenario that ants move around in a 2D grid and carry or drop objects to perform categorization. Our proposed ant-based clustering approach does not rely on a 2D grid structure. In addition, it can also generate optimal number of clusters without incorporating any other algorithms such as K-means or AHC. Experimental results on the subsets of 20 Newsgroup data show that the ant-based clustering approach outperforms the classical document clustering methods such as K-means and Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering. It also achieves better results than those obtained using the Artificial Immune Network algorithm when tested in the same datasets.

However, these methods cannot avoid classifying normal mail as spam mail for probability characteristics. The evident difference between spam mail and normal mail is that one spam mail will be delivered to many users, while most normal mails have only one single receiver, Based on this observation, this paper presents a server-based massive mail classifier incorporating counting-based classifier, bitmap-based white list (BWL) and grey list to filter massive spam mails. Results show that the spam mail classifier using our method can filter spam with a very low degree of false positive and also preserves performance while coping with large volumes of spam mail. With optimized parameter configuration, our method achieves a precision of 100% and recall of 75.3% in spam mail classification.

The system integrates product design in a workflow-oriented solution, and is built over a workflow management system that delegates activities execution to a problem-solving layer. An accurate estimation of the manufacturing cost of a custom furniture client order allows competitive prices, better profits adjustment, and increments the client portfolio too. Nevertheless, task scope is even broader. On one hand, it fixes future material and storage capacity requirements. On the other hand, it defines the manufacturing plan and logistic requirements to fulfil the client order in time. However, these objectives cannot be achieved without an adequate product design, which relates client order requirements with a manufacturing and assembly-oriented design.

A scheduling agent with a classifier system (CS) that is a GBML system is introduced to generate suitable rules to decide the timing to release new products onto a production floor according to the distribution of work in process (WIP) number. Feasibility of the proposed lot release control method is assessed based on results of computer simulations modeling a multi-product semiconductor manufacturing system. Comparisons with existing lot release control methods in terms of throughput, turn around time (TAT) and WIP were performed. Analyses of lot release rules that were acquired by the scheduling agent were also performed.

This results on the one hand from the continuously changing and hardly predictable state of an environment that is populated with humans and robots. On the other hand, a task knowledge description of a robot which cooperates with humans has to be adaptable and extendable. This paper presents a task knowledge representation for service robots called Flexible Programs (FP) and the environment for execution of FPs.

Both approaches have complementary advantages-and drawbacks depending on the structure of the knowledge that should be represented. Implicative rule bases are less sensitive to incompleteness of knowledge. However, implication-based inference has not been widely used. This disregard is probably due to the lack of suitable methods for the automated acquisition of implicative fuzzy rules. In this paper a genetic programming based approach for the data-driven extraction of implicative fuzzy rules is presented. The proposed algorithm has been applied to the acquisition of rule bases for the design of reinforced concrete structural members. Finally an outlook on the application of the presented approach within a machine learning environment for evolutionary design and optimization of complex structural systems is given.

"Intelligent" implies that the room is considered to behave in an intelligent manner or includes some aspect of artificial intelligence in its implementation. The focus of this paper is intelligent sensed environments, including rooms or interactive spaces that display adaptive behaviour through learning and motivation. We present motivated agent models that incorporate machine learning in which the motivation component eliminates the need for a benevolent teacher to prepare problem specific reward functions or training examples. Our model of motivation is based on concepts of "curiosity", "novelty" and "interest". We explore the potential for this model through the implementation of a curious place.

However, there are two problems to be solved in this field: one is the multi-class classification problem, and the other is the sensitivity to the noisy data. In order to overcome these difficulties, a novel method of fuzzy compensation multi-class support vector machine, named as FC-SVM, is proposed in this paper. This method imports a fuzzy compensation function to the penalty in the straightly construction multi-class SVM classification problem proposed by Weston and Watkins. Aim at the dual affects to classification results by each input data, this method has punish item be fuzzy, compensates weight to classification, reconstructs the optimization problem and its restrictions, reconstructs Langrage formula, and presents the theories deduction. This method is applied to the benchmark data sets. The experiment presents our method is feasible.

The classification rule mining algorithm based-on ant colony optimization (ACO) is researched in this paper. Some improvements are implemented based on existing research to enhance classification predictive accuracy and simplicity of rules. Multi-population parallel strategy is proposed, the cost-based discretization method is adopted, and parameters in the algorithm are adjusted step by step. With these improvements, performance of the algorithm is advanced, and classification predictive accuracy is enhanced. Finally, SIMiner, a self-development data mining software system based on swarm intelligence, is applied to experiment on six data sets taken from UCI Repository on Machine Learning. The results illuminate the algorithm proposed in this paper has better performance in predictive accuracy and simplicity of rules.

A string vector is defined as a finite ordered set of words. Almost all of machine learning algorithms including traditional versions of SVM use numerical vectors as their input data. In order to apply such machine learning algorithms to classification or clustering, any type of raw data should be encoded into numerical vectors. In text categorization or text clustering, representing documents into numerical vectors leads to two main problems: huge dimensionality and sparse distribution. Although traditional versions of SVM are tolerable to huge dimensionality, they are not robust to sparse distribution in their training and classification. Therefore, in order to avoid this problem, this research proposes another version of SVM, which uses string vectors given as an alternative type of structured data to numerical vectors. For applying the proposed version of SVM to text categorization, documents are encoded into string vectors by defining conditions of words as their features and positioning words corresponding to the conditions into each string vector. A similarity matrix, word by word, which defines semantic similarities of words, should be built from a given training corpus, before using the proposed version of SVM for text categorization. Each semantic similarity given as an element of the matrix is computed based on collocations of two words within their same documents over a given corpus. In this paper, inner product of two string vectors as the proposed kernel function indicates an average semantic similarity over their elements. In order to validate the proposed version of SVM, it will be compared with a traditional version of SVM using linear kernel functions in text categorization on two test beds.

We evaluate two variants of this approach in comparison to the standard Stacking algorithm, one of which is a static approach that prunes back the ensemble to the same constant size, the other of which is a variable approach prunes the ensemble to an appropriate level based on measures of accuracy and diversity of the ensemble members. We show that on average both techniques are robust in performance to their non-pruned counterpart, while having the advantage of producing smaller and less complex ensembles. In the latter respect, the static approach proved more effective, but we show that the variable approach lends itself better for further optimization.

A neural network based CBIR system using STI features and relevance feedback	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						content-based image retrieval; multimedia data mining; machine learning; neural networks; relevance feedback	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; COLOR; SHAPE	Multimedia mining primarily involves, information analysis and retrieval based on implicit knowledge. The ever increasing digital image databases on the Internet has created a need for using multimedia mining on these databases for effective and efficient retrieval of images. Contents of an image can be expressed in different features such as Shape, Texture and Intensity-distribution(STI). Content Based Image Retrieval(CBIR) is an efficient retrieval of relevant images from large databases based on features extracted from the image. Most of the existing systems either concentrate on a single representation of all features or linear combination of these features. The paper proposes a CBIR System named STIRF (Shape, Texture, Intensity-distribution with Relevance Feedback) that uses a neural network for nonlinear combination of the heterogenous STI features. Further the system is self-adaptable to different applications and users based upon relevance feedback. Prior to retrieval of relevant images, each feature is first clustered independent of the other in its own space and this helps in matching of similar images. Testing the system on a database of images with varied contents and intensive backgrounds showed good results with most relevant images being retrieved for a image query. The system showed better and more robust performance compared to existing CBIR systems.

Sequential patterns for text categorization	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						text mining; categorization; sequential patterns; SPaC		Text categorization is a well-known task based essentially on statistical approaches using neural networks, Support Vector Machines and other machine learning algorithms. Texts are generally considered as bags of words without any order. Although these approaches have proven to be efficient, they do not provide users with comprehensive and reusable rules about their data. Such rules are, however, very important for users to describe trends in the data they have to analyze. In this framework, an association-rule based approach has been proposed by Bing Liu (CBA). We propose, in this paper, to extend this approach by using sequential patterns in the SPaC method (Sequential Patterns for Classification) for text categorization. Taking order into account allows us to represent the succession of words through a document without complex and time-consuming representations and treatments such as those performed in natural language and grammatical methods. The original method we propose here consists in mining sequential patterns in order to build a classifier. We experimentally show that our proposal is relevant, and that it is very interesting compared to other methods. In particular, our method outperforms CBA and provides better results than SVM on some corpus.

J	Vens, C; Blockeel, H				Vens, Celine; Blockeel, Hendrik			A simple regression based heuristic for learning model trees	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						model trees; regression; heuristics; machine learning		The term "model trees" is commonly used for regression trees that contain some non-trivial model in their leaves. Popular implementations of model tree learners build trees with linear regression models in their leaves. They use reduction of variance as a heuristic for selecting tests during the tree construction process. In this article, we show that systems employing this heuristic may exhibit pathological behaviour in some quite simple cases. This is not visible in the predictive accuracy of the tree, but it reduces its explanatory power. We propose an alternative heuristic that yields equally accurate but simpler trees with better explanatory power, and this at little or no additional computational cost. The resulting model tree induction algorithm is experimentally evaluated and compared with simpler and more complex approaches on a variety of synthetic and real world data sets.

We describe Backward-Chaining Rule Induction (BCRI) as a semi-supervised mechanism for biasing the search for IF-THEN rules that express plausible feature interactions. BCRI adds to a relatively limited tool-chest of hypothesis generation software and is an alternative to purely unsupervised association-rule learning. We illustrate BCRI by using it to search for gene-to-gene causal mechanisms that underlie lung cancer. Mapping hypothesized gene interactions against prior knowledge offers support and explanations for hypothesized interactions, and suggests gaps in current knowledge that induction might help fill. Our assumption is that "good" hypotheses incrementally extend/revise existing knowledge. BCRI is implemented as a wrapper around a base supervised-rule-leaming algorithm. We summarize our prior work with an adaptation of C4.5 as the base algorithm (C45-BCRI), extending this in the current study to use Brute as the base algorithm (Brute-BCRI). In contrast to C4.5's greedy strategy, Brute extensively searches the rule space. Moreover, Brute returns many more rules (i.e., hypothesized feature interactions) than does C4.5. To remain an effective hypothesis-generation tool requires that Brute-BCRI more carefully rank and prune hypothesized interactions than does C45-BCRI. Prior knowledge serves to evaluate final Brute-BCRI rules just as it does with C45-BCRI, but prior knowledge also serves to evaluate and prune intermediate search states, thus maintaining a manageable number of rules for evaluation by a domain expert.

In this paper, we are concerned with ambiguous label classification (ALC), an extension of this setting in which several candidate labels may be assigned to a single example. By extending three concrete classification methods to the ALC setting (nearest neighbor classification, decision tree learning, and rule induction) and evaluating their performance on benchmark data sets, we show that appropriately designed learning algorithms can successfully exploit the information contained in ambiguously labeled examples.

Analyzing a class of pseudo-random bit generator through inductive machine learning paradigm	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						machine learning; classificatory prediction problem; next-bit prediction; stream cipher; linear feedback shift register; pseudo random bit generator	PREDICTION	Random number generation is an integral part of strong cipher systems. If a pseudo-random sequence can be predicted with better than chance probability then the generator is considered to be cryptographically weak. This paper deals with next bit prediction of pseudo-random binary sequences generated by Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) and LFSR-based Pseudo-Random Bit Generators (PRBG), using inductive Machine Learning (ML) paradigm, namely C4.5 the most common and widely used inductive data mining algorithm. This machine learning technique has been introduced to convert the theoretical prediction problem into a classification problem, which we coined as Classificatory Prediction problem. We further extended the use of this technique to predict next bit without having any knowledge of subsequent bits of the PRBG and can be termed as true Next Bit Predictor. The technique used is independent of the parameters and domain knowledge of the pseudo-random bit generators. The present study is a comprehensive extension of the work done by Hernandez et al. [15]. We performed meticulous experiments (over wide range of LFSRs) and came out with a more explanatory analysis. Our classificatory prediction results paved the way for the evolution of the next bit prediction model.

The Naive Bayes Classifier is based on the assumption of independence among the values of the attributes given the class value. Consequently, its effectiveness may decrease when the attributes are interdependent. We present FBL, a wrapper that uses information about dependencies to guide the search for the optimal subset of features and we use the Naive Bayes Classifier as the black-box Machine Learning algorithm. Experimental results show that FBL allows the Naive Bayes Classifier to achieve greater accuracies, and that FBL performs better than other classical filters and wrappers.

The underlying hybrid filtering method is based on e-mail origin and content. The system classifies each of the three parts of e-mails separately by using a sinole Bayesian filter together with a heuristic knowledge base. The system extracts heuristic knowledge from a set of labelled words as the basis on which to begin filtering instead of conducting a training stage using a historic body of pre-classified e-mails. The classification resulting from each part is then integrated to achieve optimum effectiveness. The heuristic knowledge base allows the system to carry out intelligent management of the increase in filter vocabularies and thus ensures efficient classification. The system is dynamic and interactive and the role of the user is essential to keep the evolution of the system up to date by incremental machine learning with the evolution of spam. The user can interact with the system over a customized, friendly interface, in real time or at intervals of the user's choosing.

The aim is to take advantages of both knowledge represented by class association rules and the power of SVM algorithm to construct an efficient and accurate classifier model. Instead of using the original training set, a set of rule-based feature vectors, which are generated based on the discriminative ability of class association rules over the training samples, are presented to the learning process of the SVM algorithm. The reported test results demonstrate the applicability, efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model.

We implement cost-complexity pruning algorithms with general size-dependent penalties to confirm the results of [1]. Namely, that the family of pruned subtrees selected by pruning with a subadditive penalty of increasing strength is a subset of the family selected using additive penalties. Consequently, this family of pruned trees is unique, it is nested and it can be computed efficiently. However, in spite of the better theoretical grounding of cost-complexity pruning with subadditive penalties, we found no systematic improvements in the generalization performance of the final classification tree selected by cross-validation using subadditive penalties instead of the commonly used additive ones.

Therefore, the ensemble of methods makes categorization predictions with knowledge observed from different perspectives. In addition, we explore the application of a variety of combination techniques to improve the overall performance of the ensemble of classifiers. In our experiments a refined version of the WIPO-alpha(1) document collection was used to train and evaluate the classifiers. The combination ensemble that achieved the best performance obtained an improvement of 6.51% compared to the best performing classifier participating in the combination.

The uncertainties treated by HIPU include the probabilistic distribution of the operators effects and a distribution of probabilities on the possible initial states of the domain. HIPU automatically creates the abstraction hierarchy that will be used during planning, and for this it uses an extension of the Alpine method, adapted to act under uncertainty conditions. The planning process in HIPU happens initially in the highest level of abstraction, and the solution found in this level is refined by lower levels, until reaching the lowest level. During the search the plan evaluation is carried out, indicating if the plan achieves the goal with a success probability larger or equal to a previously defined value.

Using fuzzy patterns for gene selection and data reduction on microarray data	INTELLIGENT DATA ENGINEERING AND AUTOMATED LEARNING - IDEAL 2006, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL 2006)	SEP 20-23, 2006	Burgos, SPAIN		Univ Burgos		CLASSIFICATION; EXPRESSION	The advent of DNA microarray technology has supplied a large volume of data to many fields like machine learning and data mining. Intelligent support is essential for managing and interpreting this great amount of information. One of the well-known constraints specifically related to microarray data is the large number of genes in comparison with the small number of available experiments. In this context, the ability of design methods capable of overcoming current limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms is crucial to the development of successful applications. In this paper we demonstrate how a supervised fuzzy pattern algorithm can be used to perform DNA microarray data reduction over real data. The benefits of our method can be employed to find biologically significant insights relating to meaningful genes in order to improve previous successful techniques. Experimental results on acute mycloid leukemia diagnosis show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Decision making association rules for recognition of differential gene expression profiles	INTELLIGENT DATA ENGINEERING AND AUTOMATED LEARNING - IDEAL 2006, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL 2006)	SEP 20-23, 2006	Burgos, SPAIN		Univ Burgos		REGULATORY NETWORK; MICROARRAYS; GENOME	The rapid development of methods that select over/under expressed genes from RNA microarray experiments have not yet satisfied the need for tools that identify differential profiles that distinguish between experimental conditions such as time, treatment and phenotype. We evaluate several microarray analysis methods and study their performance, finding that none of the methods alone identifies all observable differential profiles, nor subsumes the results obtained by the other methods. Therefore, we propose a machine learning based methodology that identifies and combines the abilities of microarray analysis methods to recognize differential profiles. We encode the results of this methodology in decision making association rules able to decide which method or method-aggregation is optimal to retrieve a set of genes exhibiting a common profile. These solutions are optimal in the sense that they constitute partial ordered subsets of all method-aggregations bounded by the most specific and the most sensitive available solution. This methodology was successfully applied to a study of inflammation and host response to injury data set derived from the analysis of longitudinal blood microarray profiles of human volunteers treated with intravenous endotoxin compared to placebo. Our approach was able to uncover a cohesive set of differentially expressed genes and novel members exhibiting previously studied differential profiles. This guideline serves as a means to support decisions on new microarray problems.

It has been frequently shown that combining so called unstable predictors has a stabilizing effect on and improves the performance of the prediction system generated in this way. In this paper we use the resampling techniques in the context of a topology preserving map which can be used for scale invariant classification, taking into account the fact that it models the residual after feedback with a family of distributions and finds filters which make the residuals most likely under this model. This model is applied to artificial data sets and compared with a similar version based on the Self Organising Map (SOM).

Therefore, it is often hardly possible to model the problem in symbolical form using the domain knowledge or to find acceptable solution on the basis of it. In many practical problems there is a requirement for the decision support system to opearte in a dynamically changing environment. The system has to deal with continues data flow, beeing self situated in spatio-temporal environment. In such cases, it could be considered to apply AI techniques and machine learning methods. In this paper we propose an approach that aims to respond to this challenge by the construction of a learning system based on multiagent paradigm. The focus of the paper concentrates on a single-agent level where the local lazy learning method has been analysed. The results of the experiments indicate the satisfactory efficiency of the proposed solution.

This implementation is a second year entrance for Brigham Young University students to the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. The objective of the robot was to navigate a course constructed of white boundary lines and orange obstacles for the autonomous competition. A used electric wheelchair was used as the robot base. The wheelchair was purchased from a local thrift store for $28. The base was modified to include Kegresse tracks using a friction drum system. This modification allowed the robot to perform better on a variety of terrains, resolving issues with last year's design. In order to control the wheelchair and retain the robust motor controls already on the wheelchair the wheelchair joystick was simply removed and replaced with a printed circuit board that emulated joystick operation and was capable of receiving commands through a serial port connection. Three different algorithms were implemented and compared: a purely reactive approach, a potential fields approach, and a machine learning approach. Each of the algorithms used color segmentation methods to interpret data from a digital camera in order to identify the features of the course. This paper will be useful to those interested in implementing an inexpensive vision-based autonomous robot.

This technique grades students by comparing their actions to a model of expert behavior. The expert model is constructed with machine learning techniques, avoiding the costly and time-consuming process of manual knowledge elicitation and expert system implementation. A brief summary of after action review (AAR) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) provides background for a prototype AAR application with a learning expert model. A validation experiment confirms that the prototype accurately grades student behavior on a tactical aircraft maneuver application. Finally, several topics for further research are proposed.

However, the educational data sets are so small that machine learning methods cannot be applied directly. In this paper, we tackle this problem, and give general outlines for creating accurate classifiers for educational data. We describe our experiment, where we were able to predict course success with more than 80% accuracy in the middle of course, given only hundred rows of data.

To develop and evaluate the model for each emotion from the chosen subset, both the prosodic and acoustic features were used to extract the intonational patterns and correlates of emotion from speech samples. The computed features were projected using a combination of linear projection techniques for compact and clustered representation of features. The projected features were used to build models of emotions using a set of classifiers organized in hierarchical fashion. The performances of the models were obtained using number of classifiers from the WEKA machine learning toolbox. Empirical analysis indicated that the lexical information computed from both the prosodic and acoustic features at word level yielded robust classification of emotions.

A fundamental issue is how people visually perceive the affect of a speaking agent. In this paper we present the first study evaluating the relation between objective and subjective visual perception of emotion as displayed on a speaking human face, using both full video and sparse point-rendered representations of the face. We found that objective machine learning analysis of facial marker motion data is correlated with evaluations made by experimental subjects, and in particular, the lower face region provides insightful emotion clues for visual emotion perception. We also found that affect is captured in the abstract point-rendered representation.

Even if the range of gestures is limited, deciding when to play which gesture may be considered both an engineering or an artistic task. We want to strike a balance by presenting a system where gesture selection and timing can be human authored in a script, leaving full artistic freedom to the author. However, to make authoring faster we offer a rule system that generates gestures on the basis of human authored rules. To push automation further, we show how machine learning can be utilized to suggest further rules on the basis of previously annotated scripts. Our system thus offers different degrees of automation for the author, allowing for creativity and automation to join forces.

We innovate in the ordinary parameter identification process and introduce the fabric data (Kawa-bata Evaluation System data) to combine the expert's knowledge with fuzzy system. With our method the parameters of virtual garment can be calculated automatically which are assigned by the animator's experience and hard to tune in the past years. The statistic analysis and machine learning method are used to build the fuzzy system to present the fabric expert's knowledge. With interactively inputting the human subjective variables to our method, the animator who knows little knowledge in physical attributes of fabric material can also create and tune the virtual garment application. The experimental results indicate that this method can be used in practical virtual environments and has the expansibility to other applications.

This method creates initial classifiers by bagging, and then builds base classifiers by boosting using the previously created classifiers. IBB has two new techniques, a reweighting technique and data adaptation. The reweighting technique increases a weight of a sample which is misclassifled by both the ensemble classifier and previously created base classifier The data adaptation is realized by controlling the number of iteration in boosting. Experimental results using the datasets of UCI machine learning repository show that IBB resulted better accuracy than the other ensemble learning methods on several datasets and on average.

Only previously misclassifted patterns by existing component networks are used for training coming component networks sequentially. This training strategy forces coming component networks to work only on the unsolved portion of the input space. As a result coming component networks could easily maintain diversity with existing component networks in the ensemble. Finally all component networks are trained simultaneously, while maintaining error interaction among them through a penalty function. This new method has been tested extensively on several benchmark problems of machine learning and neural networks. Experimental result shows that it can produce compact ensemble structure that exhibits good generalization ability.

Many researchers have been trying to separate spam from legitimate emails using machine learning algorithms based on statistical learning methods. In this paper, an innovative and intelligent spam filtering model has been proposed based on support vector machine (SVM). This model combines both linear and nonlinear SVM techniques where linear SVM performs better for text based spam classification that share similar characteristics. The proposed model considers both text and image based email messages for classification by selecting an appropriate kernel function for information transformation.

In this paper we propose a multi-class classification algorithm based on ordinal regression algorithm using 3-class classification. This algorithm is similar to Algorithm K-SVCR and Algorithm v-K-SVCR, but it includes fewer parameters. Another advantage of our algorithm is that, for the K-class classification problem, our algorithm can be extended to using p-class classification with 2 <= p <= K. Numerical experiments on artificial data sets and benchmark data sets show that the algorithm is reasonable and effective.

The prediction of stock markets is regarded as a challenging task of financial time series prediction. In this paper, we present recent developments in stock market prediction models, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we investigate various global events and their issues on predicting stock markets. From this survey, we found that incorporating event information with prediction model plays very important roles for more accurate prediction. Hence, an accurate event weighting method and a stable automated event extraction system are required to provide better performance in financial time series prediction.

State and action spaces are assumed to be continuous. Time is assumed to be discrete, yet the discretization may be arbitrarily fine. Within the proposed algorithm, a piece of information that leads to a policy improvement, is inferred from an experiment that lasts for several consecutive steps, rather than from a single step, as in more traditional RL methods. Simulations reveal that the algorithm is able to optimize the control policies for plants for which it is very difficult to apply the traditional methods.

These rules are extracted from the set of coefficients in the ARIMA model, so they consider the autocorrelation structure of the time series, but a nonlinear approach is adopted The proposed procedure is intended to help the user in the task of specifying as simple models as possible, providing an unambiguous methodology to construct machine learning models for time series forecasting. A generalization to time series with interventions is also proposed The performance of these procedures is empirically studied by means of a comparative analysis involving time series from several domains and the multilayer perceptron is employed to approximate the non-linear models.

This paper describes multi-layer incremental inference algorithm (MLII) based on non-incremental inductive inference algorithm CN2. The MLII algorithm consists of three steps: data partitioning (divide initial data in subsets of approximately same size, shuffling data randomly); generalization of rules learned from the first subset; reduction of a set of previously obtained rules in order to produce more accurate and consistent rules. The paper provides practical experiments with the MLII algorithm that consider e-mail messages classification task. To prepare training data Levenshtein Distance processes initial e-mail database for most frequently used words in e-mail Subject and Body. The practical experiments are done to study working principles of the MLII algorithm, to check whether MLII generates more accurate rules than interface agent in e-mail messages filtering task and to see if the number of layers in MLII affects the final result.

The geographical location of the sensed event is usually important to the application. Hence, dynamically determining the physical location of every sensor node in space is crucial. In this paper, we present a new hybrid localization system (ALS) developed based on three existing localization algorithms: Ad-Hoc Positioning System (APS), Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), and Semi-Definite Programming (SDP). We consider five network properties that affect localization performance and use machine learning to obtain parameter values of ALS. Simulation shows that the new method achieves more accurate position estimation than the individual algorithms across broad network conditions.

Traditionally, data-mining systems are designed to work on a single data set. However, with the increasing number of distributed database dispersed over many machines in WANS with geographically spread locations it is necessary to adopt new techniques to improve the overall system response. The development of Bayesian belief networks and associated algorithms made possible that probabilistic reasoning becomes a real option for a large variety of Artificial Intelligence applications.

An essential step in SVMs is to devise a kernel function to compute the similarity between two data points. In this paper we review recent advances of using SVMs for RNA classification. In particular we present a new kernel that takes advantage of both global and local structural information in RNAs and uses the information together to classify RNAs. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the new kernel and show that it outperforms existing kernels when applied to classifying non-coding RNA sequences.

In the present paper, along with ANN, we select genetic programming (GP) for modelling and prediction of algal blooms in Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong. The study of the weights of the trained ANN and also the GP-evolved equations shows that they correctly identify the ecologically significant variables. Analysis of various ANN and GP scenarios indicates that good predictions of long-term trends in algal biomass can be obtained using only chlorophyll-a as input. The results indicate that the use of biweekly data can simulate long-term trends of algal biomass reasonably well, but it is not ideally suited to give short-term algal bloom predictions.

It is problem-oriented in the sense that it directly answers the question of whether the advised spatial location is important for the classification model. The method can be used to increase the accuracy of classification models by taking a small number of additional measurements. Traditionally, network optimisation is performed by means of the analysis of the kriging variances. The comparison of the method with the traditional approach is presented on a real case study with climate data.

If these latent semantic fabrics of taste could be harvested formally, the resultant resource would afford completely novel ways for representing and reasoning about web users and people in general. This paper narrates the theory and technique of such a feat - the natural language text of 100, 000 social network profiles were captured, mapped into a diverse ontology of music, books, films, foods, etc., and machine learning was applied to infer a semantic fabric of taste. Taste fabrics bring us closer to improvisational manipulations of meaning, and afford us at least three semantic functions - the creation of semantically flexible user representations, cross-domain taste-based recommendation, and the computation of taste-similarity between people - whose use cases are demonstrated within the context of three applications - the InterestMap, Ambient Semantics, and IdentityMirror Finally, we evaluate the quality of the taste fabrics, and distill from this research reusable methodologies and techniques of consequence to the semantic mining and Semantic Web communities.

The hybrid system is composed by the Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (FIR) methodology and a genetic algorithm (GA) that is the responsible of determining in an automatic way the fuzzification parameters involved in the fuzzy system, i.e. the number of fuzzy sets (classes) per variable and the membership functions. The results obtained are compared with some of the most popular classical statistical modeling methods, neural networks and other hybrid evolutionary data analysis techniques.

Rank aggregation is the mapping of inputs that rank subsets of a set of objects into a consistent ranking that represents in some meaningful way the various inputs. In the ranking of sports competitors, or academic citations or ranking of web pages the inputs are in the form of pairwise comparisons. We present here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major shortcomings in current models of aggregate ranking. Ranking methods are often criticized for being subjective and ignoring some factors or emphasizing others. In the ranking scheme here subjective considerations can be easily incorporated while their contributions to the overall ranking are made explicit. The inverse equal paths problem is introduced here, and is shown to be tightly linked to the problem of aggregate ranking "optimally". This framework is useful in making an optimization framework available and by introducing specific performance measures for the quality of the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the input rankings provided. Presented as inverse equal paths problem we devise for the aggregate ranking problem polynomial time combinatorial algorithms for convex penalty functions of the deviations; and show the NP-hardness of some forms of nonlinear penalty functions. Interestingly, the algorithmic setup of the problem is that of a network flow problem. We compare the equal paths scheme here to the eigenvector method, Coogle PageRank for ranking web sites, and the academic citation method for ranking academic papers.

Our study examined a corpus of spoken tutorial dialogues collected for development of ITSpoke, an Intelligent Tutoring Spoken Dialogue System. The authors extracted prosodic, lexical, syntactic, and student and task dependent information from student turns. Results of running 5-fold cross validation machine learning experiments using AdaBoosted C4.5 decision trees show prediction of student question-bearing turns at a rate of 79.7%. The most useful features were prosodic, especially the pitch slope of the last 200 milliseconds of the student turn. Student pre-test score was the most-used feature. Findings indicate that using turn-based units is acceptable for incorporating question detection capability into practical Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

However, different scenarios and speakers may be harder or easier to judge. In this paper we compare human to machine performance detecting deception on a single corpus, the Columbia-SRI-Colorado Corpus of deceptive speech. On average, our human judges scored worse than chance - and worse than current best machine learning performance on this corpus. However, not all judges scored poorly. Based on personality tests given before the task, we find that several personality factors appear to correlate with the ability of a judge to detect deception in speech.

Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks, such as speech and text understanding, machine translation, information retrieval, and statistical language modeling. Twelve research groups participated in the challenge and had submitted segmentation results obtained by their algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the application of these segmentation algorithms to large vocabulary speech recognition using statistical n-gram language models based on the proposed word segments instead of entire words. Experiments were done for two agglutinative and morphologically rich languages: Finnish and Turkish. We also investigate combining various segmentations to improve the performance of the recognizer.

The proposed method uses a trained support vector machine (SVM) that defines an optimized non-linear decision rule over different sets of speech features. Two alternative feature extraction processes based on: i) subband SNR estimation after denoising, and ii) long-term SNR estimation were compared. Both methods show the ability of the SVM-based classifier to learn how the signal is masked by the acoustic noise and to define an effective non-linear decision rule. However, it is shown that a feature vector incorporating contextual information yielded better speech/non-speech discrimination even when no denoising is applied. The experimental analysis carried out on the Spanish SpeechDat-Car database shows clear improvements over standard VADs including ITU G.729, ETSI AMR and ETSI AFE for distributed speech recognition (DSR), and other recently reported VADs.

The use of a greedy training algorithm is meant to alleviate the infeasible memory and computational demands that arises during the learning phase when the amount of training data increases. We show that using only a subset of the training data, chosen in a greedy manner, we can achieve as good as or better performance as when using the full training set. We can also train dPLRMs using data sets that are significantly larger than what our current computational resources can accommodate when using non-greedy approaches.

It has been stressed in the descriptive literature that such decisions must involve prediction, as they often seem to be made before a transition place has been reached. In computational systems, however, turn-taking is normally a reaction to parameters like pause length. In this paper, we report on experiments that try to bridge this gap. We describe an experiment (using controlled stimuli) that shows human performance at prediction of turn-taking decisions and then show that a model automatically induced from data can reach a similar level of performance. We then describe a series of experiments on spontaneous dialogue data where we combine pause thresholds with syntactic and prosodic information to make turn-taking decisions, successively reducing the pause threshold until reaction becomes prediction. All our classifiers improve significantly over the baselines; prediction however is shown to be the hardest task, and we discuss additional information sources that could improve it.

The introduction encompasses various application examples representing the actual AGENDER project context. Then hypotheses, method and a representative selection of results from extensive corpus analyses are presented, that build the empirical basis for the machine learning. Finally, the AGENDER approach on speaker classification is outlined, involving the comparison of different classification methods as well as evaluation results. The paper finishes with an outlook on extensions that are scheduled for the next project phase.

Mostly, three prosody components are modeled: segmental duration, pitch contour and intensity. In this study, we present our work on modeling segmental duration in Turkish using machine-learning algorithms, especially Classification and Regression Trees (CART). The models predict phone durations based on attributes such as phone identity, neighboring phone identities, lexical stress, position of syllable in word, part-of-speech (POS) information, word length in number of syllables and position of word in utterance extracted from a speech corpus of approximately 700 sentences. Obtained models predict segment durations better than mean duration approximations (similar to 0.77 Correlation Coefficient, CC, and 20.4 ms Root-Mean Squared Error, RMSE). Attributes phone identity, neighboring phone identities, lexical stress, syllable type, POS, phrase break information, and location of word in the phrase constitute best predictor set for phoneme duration modeling.

Manual rules so widely used before are now leaving the way open for the machine learning techniques and language independent tools. In this paper we present an extension of the use of transformation-based error-driven algorithm to G2P task. A set of explicit rules was inferred to correct the pronunciation for U.S. English, Spanish and Catalan using well-known machine-learning techniques in combination with transformation based algorithm. All methods applied in combination with transformation rules significantly outperform the results obtained by these methods alone.

The method of choice is a sparse non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, which in an unsupervised manner can learn sparse representations of the data. This is applied to the learning of personalized dictionaries from a speech corpus, which in turn are used to separate the audio stream into its components. We show that computational savings can be achieved by segmenting the training data on a phoneme level. To split the data, a conventional speech recognizer is used. The performance of the unsupervised and supervised adaptation schemes result in significant improvements in terms of the target-to-masker ratio.

A Probabilistic Graphical Model for Microphone Array Source Separation using Rich Pre-Trained Source Models	INTERSPEECH 2006 AND 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPOKEN LANGUAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Spoken Language Processing/INTERSPEECH 2006	2006	Pittsburgh, PA	Int Speech Commun Assoc		source separation; array processing; speech enhancement; machine learning; probabilistic models	BLIND SEPARATION	Voice based computing applications, such as phone communication and speech recognition, use microphone arrays to capture voice from a human speaker. In many environments of interest, however, sounds from other sources interfere with the speaker's voice, posing severe problems for subsequent processing. This paper describes a new framework for treating this problem, and presents and demonstrates a new algorithm for the cancellation of interfering sounds. Our framework combines techniques from statistical machine learning with ideas from speech and audio processing. An important feature involves training rich probabilistic models on data from different types of relevant sound sources. Those source models are then incorporated into a larger probabilistic model of the observed microphone data. Using that model we derive our algorithm, which is of the expectation-maximization type and infers from data the clean sound of separate individual sources. We report very good results on data recorded in different environments.

Vectors near the boundaries were pre-extracted from the training samples based on vector projection, the values of the class-conditional probability density of the boundary vectors were approximately computed by k-nearest-neighbors estimation. To approximate the class-conditional probability density function of each class of the objects in the training data set, radial basis function networks were constructed using the boundary vectors as the network centers. The classification was realized by the minimum error rate Bayesian decision rule. Simulation results for machine learning data sets show that the proposed algorithm can deliver the same level of accuracy as the support vector machines in data classification applications, and can effectively carry out data classification with more than two classes of objects.

In this paper, reciprocating engine pattern recognition based on SVM is discussed. To improve SVM recognition and reduce rejection area, several binary SVMs combined together for multi-class recognition are investigated As for better description of engine vibration signal feature, Hilbert spectrum entropy (HSE) has been used as a tool for feature extraction. The effectiveness of the method is testified by the application to the pattern recognition for a reciprocating engine. It can be concluded that this method can contribute to reciprocating engine preventative maintenance development according to the result.

Compared with conventional learning algorithms, SVM enhances the generalization ability of the models by employing structural risk minimization criterion to minimize the sample errors and simultaneously decrease the upper bound of the predict error of the models. The global optimal solution can be uniquely obtained owing to that SVM converts machine learning into quadratic programming. Based on the local data from hydrogenation equipment, a predictive model using Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) is established for three important quality targets of diesel oil in this paper, and compared with neural network and stands SVM on precision. Finally, it is proved that the proposed predictive models based on LS-SVM can predict the quality target more efficiently and rapidly than stands SVM and neural network. It provided a method for online diagnosing fault of quality targets.

Possible applications of auto-annotation methods range from Internet search engines to medical analysis software. The important aspect is that efficient image auto-annotation systems can eliminate the need of annotating huge image collections manually, which is the only solution today. Most of methods available in the literature do not use supervised machine learning as the key component. Recent researches show that supervised machine learning can successfully compete with existing approaches. This paper presents a novel image auto-annotation algorithm based of supervised machine learning with the use of C4.5 classifiers.

In this paper, we propose a new method to design classifier based on multiple granularities immune network. Firstly a multiple granularities immune network (MGIN) algorithm is employed to reduce the data and get the candidate hidden neurons and construct an original RBF network including all candidate neurons. Secondly, the removing redundant neurons procedure is used to get a smaller network. Experimental results on the real network data set show that the new classifier has higher detection and lower false positive rate than traditional RBF classifier.

We extract the signal intensity and frequency energy of audio as the attributes of input instances for the machine learning techniques. The audio is synthesized from MDI files, providing exact information of onset events. We test three state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (AW), and Naive Bayes (NB) with Ada boosting, for learning and classifying audio onsets. We found that SVMs perform best in general, based on the average of training and 10-fold cross validation errors as the evaluation criterion. We then test the SVM and NN, the two best performing methods, on Bach's Prelude in C major BWV 943, transposed to different keys and time-stretched to various tempi. The error rates ranged from 23.91% (when training set key and tempo equals those of the test set) to 37.22% (when the key is off by four accidentals) and 37.91% (when tempo is 20 beats per minute faster). The results show that audio onset detection performs significantly better when the key and tempo attributes of the test and training sets concur, than when they are different, thus supporting the utility of tempo and key knowledge in designing onset detection systems, or in prescribing confidence statistics to onset detection outcomes.

SimPoint uses data clustering algorithms from machine learning to automatically find repetitive (similar) patterns in a program's execution, and it chooses one sample to represent each unique repetitive behavior. Together these samples represent an accurate picture of the complete execution of the program. SimPoint is based on the k-means clustering algorithm: recent work proposed using a different clustering method based on multinomial models, but only provided a preliminary comparison and analysis. In this work we provide a detailed comparison of using k-means and multinomial clustering for SimPoint. We show that k-means performs better than the recently proposed multinomial clustering approach. We then propose two improvements to the prior multinomial clustering approach in the areas of feature reduction and the picking of simulation points which allow multinomial clustering to perform as well as k-means. We then conclude by examining how to potentially combine multinomial clustering with k-means.

Support vector machines (SVM) employ complex analysis techniques to solve classification and regression problems. A SVM, a machine learning technique, can be used for analysis and classification of shoulder strength data. The goals of this study were to determine the diagnostic competency of SVM based on shoulder strength data and to apply SVM analysis in efforts to derive a single representative shoulder strength score. Data were taken from fourteen isometric shoulder strength measurements of each shoulder (involved and uninvolved) in 45 rotator cuff tear patients. SVM diagnostic proficiency was found to be comparable to reported ultrasound values. Improvement of shoulder function was accurately represented by a single score in pairwise comparison of the pre-operative and the 12 month post-operative group (P < 0.004). Thus, the SVM-based score may be a promising metric for summarizing rotator cuff strength data. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Descriptors calculated from the molecular structures alone were used to represent the characteristics of the peptides. The four molecular descriptors selected by the heuristic method (HM) in COmprehensive DEscriptors for Structural and Statistical Analysis (CODESSA) were used as inputs for support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function neural networks (RNFNN). The results obtained by the novel machine learning technique, SVM, were compared with those obtained by HM and RBFNN. The root mean squared errors (RMS) of the training, predicted and overall data sets are 2.192, 2.541 and 2.267 unit (kJ/mol) for HM, 1.604, 2.478 and 1.817 unit (kJ/mol) for RBFNN and 1.5621, 2.364 and 1.756 unit (kJ/mol) for SVM, respectively. The prediction results were in agreement with the experimental values. This paper provided a potential method for predicting the physiochemical property (Delta G(theta)) of various small peptides.

J	Golub, K				Golub, K			Automated subject classification of textual web documents	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Review						automation; classification; Internet; document management; controlled languages	FEATURE-SELECTION; LIBRARY	Purpose - To provide an integrated perspective to similarities and differences between approaches to automated classification in different research communities (machine learning, information retrieval and library science), and point to problems with the approaches and automated classification as such. Design/methodology/approach - A range of works dealing with automated classification of full-text web documents are discussed. Explorations of individual approaches are given in the following sections: special features (description, differences, evaluation), application and characteristics of web pages. Findings - Provides major similarities and differences between the three approaches: document pre-processing and utilization of web-specific document characteristics is common to all the approaches; major differences are in applied algorithms, employment or not of the vector space model and of controlled vocabularies. Problems of automated classification are recognized. Research limitations/implications - The paper does not attempt to provide an exhaustive bibliography of related resources. Practical implications - As an integrated overview of approaches from different research communities with application examples, it is very useful for students in library and information science and computer science, as well as for practitioners. Researchers from one community have the information on how similar tasks are conducted in different communities. Originality/value - To the author's knowledge, no review paper on automated text classification attempted to discuss more than one community's approach from an integrated perspective.

J	Demsar, J				Demsar, J			Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						comparative studies; statistical methods; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; Friedman test; multiple comparisons tests	CLASSIFICATION LEARNING ALGORITHMS; TESTS	While methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. This article reviews the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD ( critical difference) diagrams.

J	Huang, TK; Weng, RC; Lin, CJ				Huang, TK; Weng, RC; Lin, CJ			Generalized Bradley-Terry models and multi-class probability estimates	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						Bradley-Terry model; probability estimates; error correcting output codes; support vector machines	REDUCING MULTICLASS; PAIRED COMPARISONS; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; BINARY	The Bradley-Terry model for obtaining individual skill from paired comparisons has been popular in many areas. In machine learning, this model is related to multi-class probability estimates by coupling all pairwise classification results. Error correcting output codes (ECOC) are a general framework to decompose a multi-class problem to several binary problems. To obtain probability estimates under this framework, this paper introduces a generalized Bradley-Terry model in which paired individual comparisons are extended to paired team comparisons. We propose a simple algorithm with convergence proofs to solve the model and obtain individual skill. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the algorithm is useful for obtaining multi-class probability estimates. Moreover, we discuss four extensions of the proposed model: 1) weighted individual skill, 2) home-field advantage, 3) ties, and 4) comparisons with more than two teams.

ML-TIPN: An algorithm for automated acquisition of domain models based on time interval Petri Nets	JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article								Extended Petri Nets have been applied to artificial intelligence reasoning processes, in areas such as planning, uncertainty reasoning, knowledge-based intelligent systems, and qualitative simulation. Creating Petri Net domain models faces the same challenges that confront all knowledge-intensive At performance systems: model specification, knowledge acquisition, and refinement. Thus, a fundamental question to investigate is the degree to which automation can be used. This paper formulates the learning task and presents the first machine learning method for Time Interval Petri Net (TIPN) domain models. In a preliminary evaluation within a damage control domain, the method learned a nearly perfect model of fire spread augmented with temporal and spatial data.

However, not many Web search engines-and content filtering applications learn the user preferences over time. In this study, we proposed two machine-learning approaches that can be used to learn consumer preferences to identify documents that are most relevant to the consumer. We test the proposed machine learning approaches on a few simulated data sets. The results of our study illustrate that data mining approaches can be used to design intelligent adaptive agents that can select the relevant Web pages, given query terms, for the user.

J	Afifi, N; Diederich, J; Shanableh, T				Afifi, Noura; Diederich, Joachim; Shanableh, Tamer			Computational methods for the detection of facial palsy	JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Successes and Failures in Telehealth (SFT-6)	AUG 24-25, 2006	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA					We are developing a telemedicine application which offers automated diagnosis of facial (Bell's) palsy through a Web service. We used a test data set of 43 images of facial palsy patients and 44 normal people to develop the automatic recognition algorithm. Three different image pre-processing methods were used. Machine learning techniques (support vector machine, SVM) were used to examine the difference between the two halves of the face. If there was a sufficient difference, then the SVM recognized facial palsy. Otherwise, if the halves were roughly symmetrical, the SVM classified the image as normal. It was found that the facial palsy images had a greater Hamming Distance than the normal images, indicating greater asymmetry. The median distance in the normal group was 331 (interquartile range 277-435) and the median distance in the facial palsy group was 509 (interquartile range 334-703). This difference was significant (P < 0.001). The machine learning technique had an accuracy of more than 70%. Hence, the method may be suitable for clinical applications.

Design and Measurements: A direct comparison of eight algorithms: simple PubMed queries, clinical queries (sensitive and specific versions), vector cosine comparison, citation count, journal impact factor, PageRank, and machine learning based on polynomial support vector machines. The objective was to prioritize important articles, defined as being included in a pre-existing bibliography of important literature in surgical oncology. Results: Citation-based algorithms were more effective than noncitation-based algorithms at identifying important articles. The most effective strategies were simple citation count and PageRank, which on average identified over six important articles in the first 100 results compared to 0.85 for the best noncitation-based algorithm (p < 0.001). The authors saw similar differences between citation-based and noncitation-based algorithms at 10, 20, 50, 200, 500, and 1,000 results (p < 0.001). Citation lag affects performance of PageRank more than simple citation count. However, in spite of citation lag, citation-based algorithms remain more effective than noncitation-based algorithms. Conclusion: Algorithms that have proved successful on the World Wide Web can be applied to biomedical information retrieval. Citation-based algorithms can help identify important articles within large sets of relevant results. Further studies are needed to determine whether citation-based algorithms can effectively meet actual user information needs.

The main contribution of the BBCI, which is a non-invasive EEG-based BCI system, is the use of advanced machine learning techniques that allow to adapt to the specific brain signatures of each user with literally no training. In BBCI a calibration session of about 20min is necessary to provide a data basis from which the individualized brain signatures are inferred. This is very much in contrast to conventional BCI approaches that rely on operand conditioning and need extensive subject training of the order 50-100 hours. Our machine learning concept thus allows to achieve high quality feedback already after the very first session. This work reviews a broad range of investigations and experiments that have been performed within the BBCI project. In addition to these general paradigmatic BCI results, this work provides a condensed outline of the underlying machine learning and signal processing techniques that make the BBCI succeed. In the first experimental paradigm we analyze the predictability of limb movement long before the actual movement takes place using only the movement intention measured from the pre-movement (readiness) EEG potentials. The experiments include both off-line studies and an online feedback paradigm. The limits with respect to the spatial resolution of the somatotopy are explored by contrasting brain patterns of movements of left vs. right hand rsp. foot. In a second complementary paradigm voluntary modulations of sensorimotor rhythms caused by motor imagery (left hand vs. right hand vs. foot) are translated into a continuous feedback signal. Here we report results of a recent feedback study with 6 healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control: half of the subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm). Furthermore one subject used the BBCI to operate a mental typewriter in free spelling mode.

Support vector machine provides a new pathway for clustering, however, it behaves bad in handling massive data. As an emergent theory, artificial immune system can effectively recognize antigens and produce the memory antibodies. This mechanism is constantly used to achieve representative or feature data from raw data. A combinational clustering method is proposed in this paper based on artificial immune system and support vector machine, Experimentation in functionality and performance is done in detail. Finally a more challenging application in elevator industry is conducted. The results strongly indicate that this combinational clustering in this paper is of feasibility and of practice.

The increased number of solutions produced has called for an intelligent module selecting those closer to user's preferences. We have proposed and implemented such a module, featuring two components: a Decision Support Component, capturing user preferences based on attribute weight assignment techniques (used in SMART, AHP and via RR), and a Machine Learning Component, learning preferences by incrementally training a neural network committee based on user evaluated solutions. Alternative configurations must be compared before actual use of the ML Component takes place. Due to the practical limitation on the number of solutions that can be inspected and evaluated by human users, an automated mechanism plays the role of a group of virtual users. The best performing configuration, regarding virtual users' preferences, will be integrated to the system and evaluated against actual human evaluation results.

To ease this limitation, we present an adaptation of the Regularized Least-Squares (RLS) algorithm for ranking pieces of nursing notes with respect to their relevance to breathing, blood circulation, and pain. We assessed the ranking results by using Kendall's tau(b) as a measure of association between the output of the RLS algorithm and the desired ranking. The values of tau(b) were 0.62, 0.69, and 0.44 for breathing, blood circulation, and pain, respectively. These values indicate that a machine learning approach can successfully be used to rank nursing notes, and encourage further research on the use of ranking techniques when developing intelligent tools for the utilization of nursing narratives.

In our approach, first a prespecified number of candidate fuzzy rules are extracted from numerical data in a heuristic manner using rule evaluation criteria. Then multiobjective genetic rule selection is applied to the extracted candidate fuzzy rules to find a number of non-dominated rule sets with respect to the classification accuracy and the complexity. The obtained non-dominated rule sets form an accuracy-complexity tradeoff surface. The performance of each non-dominated rule set is evaluated in terms of its classification accuracy and its complexity. Computational experiments show that our approach finds simple fuzzy rules with high interpretability for some benchmark data sets in the UC Irvine machine learning repository.

Furthermore, the nature of this machine learning algorithm allows extending its applications to deal with other kinds of systems with no vectorial information such as facial images, hand written texts, micro-array gene expressions, or protein chains. The behavior of a number of systems could be better explained if artificial infinite-precision variables were replaced by qualitative variables. Hence, the use of ordinal or interval scales on input variables would allow kernels to be defined for nature-inspired systems directly.

We propose to apply feature evaluation measure broadly used in the machine learning field and not so popular in the DNA microarray field. Besides, the application of sequential gene subset selection approaches is included. In our study, we propose some well-known criteria (filters and wrappers) to rank attributes, and a greedy search procedure combined with three subset evaluation measures. Two completely different machine learning classifiers are applied to perform the class prediction. The comparison is performed on two well-known DNA microarray data sets. We notice that most of the top-ranked genes appear in the list of relevant-informative genes detected by previous studies over these data sets.

The repository method for chance discovery in financial forecasting	KNOWLEDGE-BASED INTELLIGENT INFORMATION AND ENGINEERING SYSTEMS, PT 3, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems	OCT 09-11, 2006	Bournemouth, ENGLAND					The aim of this work is to forecast future opportunities in financial stock markets, in particular, we focus our attention on situations where positive instances are rare, which falls into the domain of Chance Discovery. Machine learning classifiers extend the past experiences into the future. However the imbalance between positive and negative cases poses a serious challenge to machine learning techniques. Because it favours negative classifications, which has a high chance of being correct due to the nature of the data. Genetic Algorithms have the ability to create multiple solutions for a single problem. To exploit this feature we propose to analyse the decision trees created by Genetic Programming. The objective is to extract and collect different rules that classify the positive cases. It lets model the rare instances in different ways, increasing the possibility of identifying similar cases in the future. To illustrate our approach, it was applied to predict investment opportunities with very high returns. From experiment results we showed that the Repository Method can consistently improve both the recall and the precision.

It has been frequently shown that combining so called unstable predictors has a stabilizing effect on and improves the performance of the prediction system generated in this way. In this paper we use the resampling techniques in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We show that the proposed PCA ensembles exhibit a much more robust behaviour in the presence of outliers which can seriously affect the performance of an individual PCA algorithm. The performance and characteristics of the proposed approaches are illustrated on a number of experimental studies where an individual PCA is compared to the introduced PCA ensemble.

There are two possibilities: either to resort to the existing and published templates suitable for the problem under consideration or to construct the templates by one of well-known training methods, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc. In this paper, a novel approach which utilizes the formalism of support vector machines (SVMs) is introduced. We found the CNN template optimisation done by this machine learning technique superior to other training methods. The learning time reduced from several hours to less than a minute. Testing our novel approach on ultrasound ovarian images, the obtained segmentation results and recognition rates for ovarian follicles were significantly better than with comparable solutions.

The use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of stochastic approximation makes the Bayesian DT averaging feasible. In this paper we describe a new Bayesian MCMC technique exploiting a sweeping strategy allowing the posterior distribution to be estimated accurately under a lack of prior information. In our experiments with the solar flares data, this technique has revealed a better performance than that obtained with the standard Bayesian DT technique.

Indeed, software metrics provide a quantitative approach allowing the control and the improvement of the development process including the maintenance. The ISO/IEC international standard (14598) on software product quality states, "Internal metrics are of little value unless there is evidence that they are related to external quality". Many empirical prediction models are presented in the literature; their goal is to investigate the relationship between internal metrics and external qualities, in order to assess software quality. In this paper, we explore different machine-learning (ML) algorithms provided by an open source data-mining environment. We analyse their capacities to produce accurate and usable predictive models.

We present an approach for combining element-level evidence of similarity for matching XML schemas with a composite approach. By combining high recall algorithms in a composite system we reduce the number of real matches missed. By performing experiments on a number of machine learning models for combination of evidence in a composite approach and choosing the SMO for the high precision and recall, we increase the reliability of the final matching results. The precision is therefore enhanced (e.g., with data sets used by Cupid and suggested by the author of LSD, our precision is respectively 13.05% and 31.55% higher than COMA and Cupid on average).

Previous empirical work has convincingly shown that adding constraints to clustering improves performance, with respect to the true data labels. However, in most of these experiments, results are averaged over different randomly chosen constraint sets, thereby masking interesting properties of individual sets. We demonstrate that constraint sets vary significantly in how useful they are for constrained clustering; some constraint sets can actually decrease algorithm performance. We create two quantitative measures, informativeness and coherence, that can be used to identify useful constraint sets. We show that these measures can also help explain differences in performance for four particular constrained clustering algorithms.

(2003) pointed out that the k-means cluster centers in subsequence time-series clustering become sinusoidal pseudo-patterns for almost all kinds of input time-series data. Understanding this mechanism is an important open problem in data mining. Our new theoretical approach (based on spectral clustering and translational symmetry) explains why the cluster centers of k-means naturally tend to form sinusoidal patterns.

We present a time-and-memory-efficient discretization technique based on computing epsilon-approximate exponential frequency quantiles, and prove bounds on the worst-case error introduced in computing information entropy in data streams compared to an offline algorithm that has no efficiency constraints. We compare the empirical performance of the technique, using it for feature selection, with (streaming adaptations of) two popular methods of discretization, equal width binning and equal frequency binning, under a variety of streaming scenarios for real and artificial datasets. Our experiments show that E-approximate exponential frequency quantiles are remarkably consistent in their performance, in contrast to the simple and efficient equal width binning that perform quite well when the streams are from stationary distributions, and quite poorly otherwise.

However, compared to other ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting, BOC is less known and rarely used in data mining. This is partly due to BOC being perceived as being inefficient and because bagging and boosting consistently outperforms a single model, which raises the question: "Do we even need BOC in datamining?". We show that the answer to this question is "yes" by illustrating several recent efficient model averaging approximations to BOC can significantly outperform bagging and boosting in realistic situations such as extensive class label noise, sample selection bias and many-class problems. That model averaging techniques outperform bagging and boosting in these situations has not been published in the machine learning, mining or statistical communities to our knowledge.

However, such experiments are often not as extensive and systematic as they ideally would be, and therefore the experimental results must be interpreted with caution. In this paper we present a new experimental methodology that is based on the concept of "experiment databases". An experiment database can be seen as a special kind of inductive database, and the experimental methodology consists of filling and then querying this database. We show that the novel methodology has numerous advantages over the existing one. As such, this paper presents a novel and interesting application of inductive databases that may have a significant impact on experimental research in machine learning and data mining.

We are currently focusing on PubMed abstracts and trying to extract named entities and their relationships, especially protein names and protein-protein interactions. We are adopting methods including natural language processing, machine learning, and text processing. But we are not developing a new tagging or parsing technique. Developing a new tagger or a new parser specialized in life science literature is a very complex job. And it is not easy to get a good result by tuning an existing parser or by training it without a sufficient corpus. These all are another research topics and we are trying to extract information, not to develop something to help the extracting job or else. In this paper, we introduce our method to use an existing full parser without training or tuning. After tagging sentences and extracting proteins, we make sentences simple by substituting some words like named entities, nouns into one word. Then parsing errors are reduced and parsing precision is increased by this sentence simplification, We parse the simplified sentences syntactically with an existing syntactic parser and extract protein-protein interactions from its results. We show the effects of sentence simplification and syntactic parsing.

Learning to extract proper names in natural language text is a named entity recognition (NER) task. Previous studies focus on combining abundant human made rules, trigger words, to enhance the system performance. However these methods require domain experts to build up these rules and word set which relies on lots of human efforts. In this paper, we present a robust named entity recognition system based on support vector machines (SVM). By integrating with rich feature set and the proposed mask method, the system performance is satisfactory on the MUC-7 and biology named entity recognition tasks which outperforms famous machine learning-based method, such as hidden markov model (HMM), and maximum entropy model (MEM). We compare our method to previous systems that were performed on the same data set. The experiments show that when training with the MUC-7 data set, our system achieves 86.4 in F-(beta=1) rate and 81.57 for the biology corpus. Besides, our named entity system is able to handle real time processing applications, the turn around time on a 63 K words document set is less than 30 seconds.

Decision tree technique was employed to induce useful information hidden within a vast collection of data. The major objective of this study was to classify the existing data into certain types of segmentations and then predict the behaviour of a ball joint assembly. The intervals of the rolling time and achieved rolling force leading to occurrence of the high moment values of the ball joint during testing stage have been found.

Currently, performance verification during the staging process is accomplished through either an expensive, cumbersome manual approach or ad hoc automation. This paper describes an automation approach as part of the Elba project supporting monitoring and performance analysis of distributed multi-tiered applications that helps in bottleneck detection. We use machine-learning to determine service-level objectives (SLOs) satisfaction and locate bottlenecks in candidate deployment scenarios. We evaluate our tools with TPC-W, an on-line bookstore, and RUBiS, an on-line auction site.

We show that this problem can be naturally formulated as a shortest-distance problem over an intersection automaton defined on an appropriate semiring. We describe simple and efficient novel algorithms for its computation and report the results of experiments demonstrating the practicality of our algorithms for very large weighted automata. Our algorithms apply to unambiguous weighted automata, a class of weighted automata that strictly includes deterministic weighted automata. These are also the first algorithms extending the computation of entropy or of relative entropy beyond the class of deterministic weighted automata.

The author presents a vision of future for CE and CAE where computational intelligence (CI) will play an increasingly significant role. Various disciplines within CE such as design, manufacturing, knowledge management, collaborative computing, Web processes and services, and distributed infrastructures must rely heavily on CI to achieve the increasing sophistication demand. The author has been advocating and advancing a multi-paradigm approach for solution of complicated and noisy computational intelligence problems. In 1995 he co-authored Machine Learning - Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Fuzzy Systems [1] the first authored book that presented and integrated the three principal soft computing and computational intelligence approaches. It was shown that such integration would provide a more powerful approach than any of the three approaches used individually. Since the publication of that ground-breaking book the author and his associates have demonstrated that chaos theory and wavelets can be used to further enhance computational intelligence especially for complicated and noisy pattern recognition problems. In this lecture it is shown how wavelets can be used as a powerful tool to complement and enhance other soft computing techniques such as neural networks and fuzzy logic as well as the chaos theory for solution of complicated and seemingly intractable Cl problems. Examples of research performed by the author and his research associates in the areas of intelligent transportation systems [2-4], vibrations control [5-8], and nonlinear system identification [9-10] are presented.

While ILP initially focussed on automated program synthesis from examples, it has recently expanded its scope to cover a whole range of data analysis tasks (classification, regression, clustering, association analysis). ILP algorithms can this be used to find patterns in relational data, i.e., for relational data mining (RDM). This paper briefly introduces the basic concepts of ILP and RDM and discusses some recent research trends in these areas.

The Challenge was set up to evaluate the ability of Machine Learning algorithms to provide good "probabilistic predictions", rather than just the usual "point predictions" with no measure of uncertainty, in regression and classification problems. Participants had to compete on a number of regression and classification tasks, and were evaluated by both traditional losses that only take into account point predictions and losses we proposed that evaluate the quality of the probabilistic predictions.

We describe the methods we used in regression challenges, including our winning method for the Outaouais data set. We then turn our attention to the more general problem of scoring in probabilistic machine learning challenges. It is widely accepted that scoring rules should be proper in the sense that the true generative distribution has the best expected score; we note that while this is useful, it does not guarantee finding the best methods for practical machine learning tasks. We point out some problems in local scoring rules such as the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD), and illustrate with examples that many of these problems can be avoided by a distance-sensitive rule such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).

As in many other NLP tasks, Machine Learning may offer important tools to better understand the problem. In this paper, we will investigate the usefulness of Machine Learning algorithms to address an apparently simple and well defined classification problem: the recognition of Textual Entailment. Due to its specificity, we propose an original feature space, the distance feature space, where we model the distance between the elements of the candidate entailment pairs. The method has been tested on the data of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge.

However, the performance of theorem proving on its own turns out to be highly dependent on a wide range of background knowledge, which is not necessarily included in publically available knowledge sources. Therefore, we achieve robustness via two extensions. Firstly, we incorporate model building, a technique borrowed from automated reasoning, and show that it is a useful robust method to approximate entailment. Secondly, we use machine learning to combine these deep semantic analysis techniques with simple shallow word overlap. The resulting hybrid model achieves high accuracy on the RTE testset, given the state of the art. Our results also show that the various techniques that we employ perform very differently on some of the subsets of the RTE corpus and as a result, it is useful to use the nature of the dataset as a feature.

In contrast to the huge literature on learning in games where an agent's model is deduced from its previous actions in a multi-stage game, we propose the idea of inferring correlations between agents' actions in different one-shot games in order to predict an agent's action in a game which she did not play yet. We define the approach and show, using real data obtained in experiments with human subjects, the feasibility of this approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method can be used to increase payoffs of an adequately informed agent. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first proposed and tested approach for learning in one-shot games, which is the most basic form of multiagent interaction.

To date, the only method to assess confidence of ROC curves is to construct ROC bands. In the case of severe class imbalance with few instances of the minority class, ROC bands become unreliable. We propose a generic framework for classifier evaluation to identify a segment of an ROC curve in which misclassifications are balanced. Confidence is measured by Tango's 95%-confidence interval for the difference in misclassification in both classes. We test our method with severe class imbalance in a two-class problem. Our evaluation favors classifiers with low numbers of misclassifications in both classes. Our results show that the proposed evaluation method is more confident than ROC bands.

In the case of planning, examples are usually extracted from the search tree generated when solving problems. Therefore, examples depend on the problems used for training. Traditionally, these problems are randomly generated by selecting some difficulty parameters. In this paper, we discuss several active learning schemes that improve the relationship between the number of problems generated and planning results in another test set of problems. Results show that these schemes are quite useful for increasing the number of solved problems.

We propose to exploit API for the closed-loop learning of mappings from images to actions. This approach requires a family of function approximators that maps visual percepts to a real-valued function. For this purpose, we use Regression Extra-Trees, a fast, yet accurate and versatile machine learning algorithm. The inputs of the Extra-Trees consist of a set of visual features that digest the informative patterns in the visual signal. We also show how to parallelize the Extra-Tree learning process to further reduce the computational expense, which is often essential in visual tasks. Experimental results on real-world images are given that indicate that the combination of API with Extra-Trees is a promising framework for the interactive learning of visual tasks.

Transductive inference tries to improve the predictive accuracy of learning algorithms by making use of the information contained in these test instances. Although this description of transductive inference applies to predictive learning problems in general, most transductive approaches consider the case of classification only. In this paper we introduce a transductive variant of Gaussian process regression with automatic model selection, based on approximate moment matching between training and test data. Empirical results show the feasibility and competitiveness of this approach.

Typically, these structured output scenarios are also characterized by a high cost associated with obtaining supervised training data, motivating the study of active learning for these situations. Starting with active learning approaches for multiclass classification, we first design querying functions for selecting entire structured instances, exploring the tradeoff between selecting instances based on a global margin or a combination of the margin of local classifiers. We then look at the setting where subcomponents of the structured instance can be queried independently and examine the benefit of incorporating structural information in such scenarios. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the semantic role labeling task demonstrate a significant reduction in the need for supervised training data when using the proposed methods.

We describe the two objectives of sharpness and calibration and suggest suitable scoring metrics for both. We use the popular negative log-likelihood as a measure of sharpness and the probability integral transform as a measure of calibration. To optimise density forecasting models under multiple criteria we introduce a multi-objective evolutionary optimisation framework that can produce better density forecasts from a prediction user's perspective. Our experiments show improvements over the state-of-the-art on a risk management problem.

Classification with support hyperplanes	MACHINE LEARNING: ECML 2006, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML 2006)	SEP 18-22, 2006	Berlin, GERMANY	Google, Humboldt Univ Berlin, Deutsch Forsch Gemeinsch, KD-Ubiq, European Off Aerosp Res & Dev, USAF Res Lab, STRATO A G, IBM, PASCAL, Mach Learning		kernel methods; large margin and instance-based classifiers		A new classification method is proposed, called Support Hyperplanes (SHs). To solve the binary classification task, SHs consider the set of all hyperplanes that do not make classification mistakes, referred to as semi-consistent hyperplanes. A test object is classified using that semi-consistent hyperplane, which is farthest away from it. In this way, a good balance between goodness-of-fit and model complexity is achieved, where model complexity is proxied by the distance between a test object and a semi-consistent hyperplane. This idea of complexity resembles the one imputed in the width of the so-called margin between two classes, which arises in the context of Support Vector Machine learning. Class overlap can be handled via the introduction of kernels and/or slack variables. The performance of SHs against standard classifiers is promising on several widely-used empirical data sets.

In particular, it is shown that the similarity between learning in higher-order logic and traditional attributevalue learning allows many results from computational learning theory to be 'ported' to the logical setting with ease. As a direct consequence, a number of non-trivial results in the higher-order setting can be established with straightforward proofs. Our satisfyingly simple analysis provides another case for a more in-depth study and wider uptake of the proposed higher-order logic approach to symbolic machine learning.			kee.siong@nicta.com.au					ANTHONY M, 2002, LSECDAM200211; Anthony M., 1999, NEURAL NETWORK LEARN; BOWERS AF, 2001, KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTA; COHEN WW, 1994, ARTIF INTELL, V68, P303, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(94)90070-1; COHEN WW, 1995, NEW GENERAT COMPUT, V13, P369; DERAEDT L, 1994, ARTIF INTELL, V70, P375, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(94)90112-0; DeRaedt L, 1997, ARTIF INTELL, V95, P187, DOI 10.1016/S0004-3702(97)00041-6; Kearns M, 1999, J COMPUT SYST SCI, V58, P109, DOI 10.1006/jcss.1997.1543; KG KS, 2005, THESIS AUSTR NATL U; Kietz J-U., 1994, SIGART B, V5, P22; KRAMER S, 2001, RELATIONAL DATA MINI, pCH11; Lloyd J.W, 1999, J FUNCTIONAL LOGIC P, V3; Lloyd J.W., 2003, LOGIC LEARNING LEARN; Muggleton S., 1994, Journal of Logic Programming, V19-20, DOI 10.1016/0743-1066(94)90035-3; NG KS, 2005, P 15 INT C IND LOG P, P246; Rivest R.

Greedy search misses useful refinements that yield a significant gain only in conjunction with other conditions. Relational learners, such as inductive logic programming algorithms, are especially susceptible to this problem. Lookahead helps greedy search overcome myopia; unfortunately it causes an exponential increase in execution time. Furthermore, it may lead to overfitting. We propose a heuristic for greedy relational learning algorithms that can be seen as an efficient, limited form of lookahead. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic yields models that are as accurate as models generated using lookahead. It is also considerably faster than lookahead.

The goal of the present work is to develop user-adaptive temporal thresholds with improved performance characteristics over state-of-the-art fixed ones, which can be accomplished by leveraging both empirical user modeling and machine learning techniques to handle the large individual differences in users' multimodal integration patterns. Using simple Naive Bayes learning methods and a leave-one-out training strategy, our model correctly predicted 88% of users' mixed speech and pen signal input as either unimodal or multimodal, and 91% of their multimodal input as either sequentially or simultaneously integrated. In addition to predicting a user's multimodal pattern in advance of receiving input, predictive accuracies also were evaluated after the first signal's end-point detection-the earliest time when a speech/pen multimodal system makes a decision regarding fusion. This system-centered metric yielded accuracies of 90% and 92%, respectively, for classification of unimodal/multimodal and sequential/simultaneous input patterns. In addition, empirical modeling revealed a.92 correlation between users' multimodal integration pattern and their likelihood of interacting multimodally, which may have accounted for the superior learning obtained with training over heterogeneous user data rather than data partitioned by user subtype. Finally, in large part due to guidance from user-modeling, the techniques reported here required as little as 15 samples to predict a "surprise" user's input patterns.

For this task, boosting and three other text based approaches previously described in the literature are used. To further improve the classification performance, three different combination schemes take into account the results of the individual classifiers. All classification methods are evaluated on the ICSI Meeting Corpus based on both reference transcripts and the output of a speech-to-text (STT) system. The results indicate that both the proposed boosting based approach and a method relying on maximum entropy substantially outperform the use of mini language models and a simple scheme relying on cue phrases. The best performance was achieved by combining individual methods with a multilayer perceptron.

Optimizing clutter mitigation for automated feature extraction in multi-spectral images - art. no. 63150F	Mathematics of Data Image Pattern Recognition, Compression, and Encryption with Applications IX	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Mathematics of Data/Image Pattern Recognition, Compression and Encryption with Application IX	AUG 15-16, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE		mathematical morphology; multispectral; optimization; image processing; feature extraction; clutter mitigation	GENIE	Accurate and robust techniques for automated feature extraction (AFE) from remotely-sensed imagery are an important area of research, having many applications in the civilian and military/intelligence arenas. Much work has been undertaken in developing sophisticated tools for performing these tasks. However, while many of these tools have been shown to perform quite well (such as the GENIE(1) and Genie Pro(2) software developed at LANL), these tools are not perfect. The classification algorithms produced often have significant errors, such as false-alarms and missed detections. We describe some efforts at improving this situation in which we add a clutter mitigation layer to our existing AFE software (Genie Pro). This clutter mitigation layer takes as input the output from the previous feature extraction (classification) layer and, using the same training data (pixels providing examples of the classes of interest), uses similar machine-learning techniques to those used in the previous AFE layer to optimise an image-processing pipeline aimed at improving any errors existing in the AFE output. While the AFE layer optimises an image processing pipeline that can combine spectral, logical, textural, morphological and other spatial operators, etc., the clutter mitigation layer is limited to a pool of morphological operators. The resulting clutter mitigation algorithm will not only be optimized for the particular feature of interest but will also be co-optimized with the preceding feature extraction algorithm. We demonstrate these techniques on several feature extraction problems in various multi-spectral, remotely-sensed images.

Triple-region image segmentation finds wide application in the computer aided X-ray, CT, MRI and ultrasound image analysis and diagnosis. Usually multiple level set functions are used consecutively or simultaneously to segment triple-region medical images. These approaches are either time consuming or suffer from the convergence problems. With the new proposed triple-regions level set energy modelling, the triple-region segmentation is handled within the two region level set framework where only one single level set function needed. Since only a single level set function is used, the segmentation is much faster and more robust than using multiple level set functions. Adapted to the clinical setting, individual principal component analysis and a support vector machine classifier based clinical acceleration scheme are used to accelerate the segmentation. The clinical acceleration scheme takes the strengths of both machine learning and the level set method while limiting their weaknesses to achieve automatic and fast clinical segmentation. Both synthesized and practical images are used to test the proposed method. These results show that the proposed method is able to successfully segment the triple-region using a single level set function. Also this segmentation is very robust to the placement of initial contour. While still quickly converging to the final image, with the clinical acceleration scheme, our proposed method can be used during pre-processing for automatic computer aided diagnosis and surgery.

Detection of blue-white veil areas in dermoscopy images using machine learning techniques - art. no. 61445T	Medical Imaging 2006: Image Processing, Pts 1-3	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Medical Imaging 2006 Conference	FEB 12-14, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE		skin cancer; dermoscopy; melanoma; blue-white veil; relative color; decision tree; pixel classification	SKIN; CLASSIFICATION; LESIONS; COLOR	As a result of the advances in skin imaging technology and the development of suitable image processing techniques, during the last decade, there has been a significant increase of interest in the computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Dermoscopy is a non-invasive skin imaging technique which permits visualization of features of pigmented melanocytic neoplasms that are not discernable by examination with the naked eye. One of the useful features in dermoscopic diagnosis is the blue-white veil (irregular, structureless areas of confluent blue pigmentation with an overlying white '' ground-glass '' film) which is mostly associated with invasive melanoma. In this preliminary study, a machine learning approach to the detection of blue-white veil areas in dermoscopy images is presented. The method involves pixel classification based on relative and absolute color features using a decision tree classifier. Promising results were obtained on a set of 224 dermoscopy images.

Bioinformatics and its impact on clinical research methods - Findings from the section on bioinformatics	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						medical informatics; International Medical Informatics Association; yearbook; bioinformatics	BIOMEDICAL TEXT; GENE; DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; CANCER; HEALTH	Objectives: To summarize current excellent research in the field of bioinformatics. Method: Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2006. Results: Current research in the field of bioinformatics clearly shows ongoing unification of experimental findings and clinical outcomes. Microarray data, gene sequences and clinical data are more and more perceived as different but related facet of one entity. Significant work is done in the area of text and data mining in order to bring together patient data and biochemical phenomena by means of ontologies. A strong trend in the clinical field is performance of exhaustive studies on DNA material derived from patient that suffer from diseases that are already known to be inherited. Examination a appropriate methods covers data and text mining, ontologies as well as machine learning and classification. Conclusions: The best paper selection of articles on bioinformatics shows examples of excellent research on methods used for studying inherited diseases and their underlying genetic dispositions. Clinical studies, inclusion of experimental findings like microarray data, and of knowledge representation formats all lead to a better understanding the linkage between gene sequences, biological functions and clinical findings in the form of healthy state or physiological disorders.

Two models for outcome prediction - A comparison of logistic regression and neural networks	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						artificial neural network; regression; benchmaking; prognosis; stroke	ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; PROGNOSTIC MODELS; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABLES; SELECTION; TRIALS; ERRORS; SCALE; RISK	Objectives: Accurately predicting disease progress from a set of predictive variables is an important aspect of clinical work. For binary outcomes, the classical approach is to develop prognostic logistic regression (LR) models. Alternatively, machine learning algorithms were proposed with artificial neural networks (ANN) having become popular over the lost decades. Although some studies have compared predictive accuracies of LR and ANN models, some concerns regarding their methodological quality have been voiced. Our comparison has the advantage of being based on two large independent data sets allowing for elaborate model development and independent validation. Methods: From the German Stroke Database, a learning data set including 1754 prospectively recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke was used. Utilizing LR and ANN, two prognostic models were developed predicting restitution of functional independence and survival after 100 days. The resulting models were applied to classify 1470 patients with acute ischemic stroke; this test data set was collected independently from the learning data. Error fractions in the test data were determined, and differences in error fractions between the algorithms were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Results: For most prognostic models, error fractions in test data were below 40%. There was no difference between the algorithms except for the model predicting completely versus incompletely restituted or deceased patients (difference in error fractions = 4.01% [2.10-5.96%], p = 0.0001). Conclusions: The conscientiously applied LR remains the gold standard for prognostic modelling; however, ANN can be an alternative automated "quick and easy" multivariate analysis.

Recently, exploiting fractal dimension to reduce the features of dataset is a novel method. FDR (Fractal Dimensionality Reduction), proposed by Traina in 2000, is the most famous fractal dimension based feature selection algorithm. However, it is intractable in the high dimensional data space for multiple scanning the dataset and incapable of eliminating two or more features simultaneously. In this paper we combine CA with the Z-ordering based FDR for addressing this problem and present a new algorithm GAZBFDR(Genetic Algorithm and Z-ordering Based FDR). The algorithm proposed can directly select the fixed number features from the feature space and utilize the fractal dimension variation to evaluate the selected features within the comparative lower space. The experimental results show that GAZBFDR algorithm achieves better performance in the high dimensional dataset.

To improve the availability of nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms in the field of machine learning, an adaptive neighbors selection scheme based on locally principal direction reconstruction is proposed in this paper. Our method involves two main computation steps. First, it selects an appropriate neighbors set for each data points such that all neighbors in a neighbors set form a d-dimensional linear subspace approximately and computes locally principal directions for each neighbors set respectively. Secondly, it fits each neighbor by means of locally principal directions of corresponding neighbors set and deletes the neighbors whose fitting error exceeds a predefined threshold. The simulation shows that our proposal could deal with data set with high variation in local manifold effectively. Moreover, comparing with other adaptive neighbors selection strategy, our method could circumvent false connectivity induced by noise or high local curvature.

Recently, support vector machine (SVM) has shown a better performance than conventional learning methods in many applications. This paper proposes a weighted kernel function for support vector machine and its learning method with a fast convergence and a good classification performance. We defined the weighted kernel function as the weighted sum of a set of different types of basis kernel functions such as neural, radial, and polynomial kernels, which are trained by a learning method based on genetic algorithm. The weights of basis kernel functions in proposed kernel are determined in learning phase and used as the parameters in the decision model in classification phase. The experiments on several clinical datasets such as colon cancer, leukemia cancer, and lung cancer datasets indicate that our weighted kernel function results in higher and more stable classification performance than other kernel functions. Our method also has comparable and sometimes better classification performance than other classification methods for certain applications.

A critical issue in a corpus-based approach for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the lack of wide-coverage resources to automatically learn the linguistic information. In particular, all-words sense annotated corpora such as SemCor do not have enough examples for many senses when used in a machine learning method. Using semantic classes instead of senses allows to collect a larger number of examples for each class while polysemy is reduced, improving the accuracy of semantic disambiguation. Cast3LB, a SemCor-like corpus, manually annotated with Spanish WordNet 1.5 senses, has been used in this paper to perform semantic disambiguation based on several sets of classes: lexicographer files of WordNet, WordNet Domains, and SUMO ontology.

The obtained results demonstrate that an ensemble of classifiers achieves higher accuracy than an individual classifier and comparable results to already existing textual entailment systems.

This variability is challenging for many natural language processing applications that try to infer the same meaning from different text variants. In order to treat this problem a generic task has been proposed: Textual Entailment Recognition. In this paper, we present a new Textual Entailment approach based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and the cosine measure. This proposed approach extracts semantic knowledge from different corpora and resources. Our main purpose is to study how the acquired information can be combined with an already developed and tested Machine Learning Entailment system (MLEnt). The experiments show that the combination of MI-Ent, LSI and cosine measure improves the results of the initial approach.

Temporal clauses are regularly marked by subordinators, many of which are ambiguous, being able to introduce clauses of different semantic roles. The paper also describes our work on generating an annotated corpus of sentences embedding clauses introduced by ambiguous subordinators that might have temporal value. Each such clause is annotated as temporal or non-temporal by testing whether it answers the questions when, how often or how long with respect to the action of its superordinate clause. Using this corpus, we then train and evaluate personalised classifiers for each ambiguous subordinator, in order to set apart temporal usages. Several classifiers are evaluated, and the best performing ones achieve an average accuracy of 89.23% across the set of ambiguous connectives.

A major SeeCoast objective is to reduce operator workload while maintaining optimal domain awareness by shifting operators' focus from having to detect events to being able to analyze and act upon the knowledge derived from automatically detected anomalous activities. Analyst-defined vessel activities are recognized from pre-scripted patterns and anomalous vessel activities are detected using machine learning techniques. The baseline SeeCoast system interfaces to the USCG Hawkeye prototype and uses (a) machine vision technology to produce target tracks from streaming video data; (b) multi-INT fusion technology to correlate radar, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and/or video track data into a single coherent track picture; (c) vessel activity analysis and learning technology to provide alerts for events of interest according to user-defined criteria; and (d) visualization of those alerts embedded within the common operating picture. The video processing component tasks and controls Hawkeye cameras to detect vessels in motion and generates vessel track and classification (based on vessel length) information. SeeCoast detects unsafe, illegal, and threatening vessel activities using a rule-based pattern recognizer and detects anomalous vessel activities on the basis of automatically learned behavior normalcy models. Operators can optionally guide the learning system in the form of examples and counter-examples of activities of interest, and refine the performance of the learning system by confirming alerts or indicating examples of false alarms. This paper focuses on the learning-based activity analysis capabilities of SeeCoast.

We will develop the architecture for an Integrated Learning System (ILS) that will enable representation tools to maximize the utility of data collected by distributed sensors. This project will suggest a system for data capture, processing, retrieval and analysis and focus on the development of semantic interoperability for ontology alignment and the ability to learn from experiences, so that performance improves as it accumulates knowledge resulting in the ability to learn new object/event classes and improve its classification accuracy. To illustrate the notion of robust learning from distinct representations of sensor data from a common source, we offer an application where a LCS addresses automatic target recognition (ATR) in extended operating conditions (EOCs). The LCS-based robust ATR system performed well, resulting in powerful ATR rules that generalize over multiple feature types, with accuracy over 99% and robustness over 80%. To illustrate the notion of ontology enabling learning, we outline preliminary experiments with a network of LCSs integrating ATR via a simple vehicle ontology.

We propose a new approach to case-based reasoning. It is based on rough set theory that is a mathematical theory for reasoning about data. More precisely, we adopt Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) that is particularly appropriate in this context for its ability of handling monotonicity relationship between ordinal properties of data related to monotonic relationships between attribute values in the considered data set. In general terms, monotonicity concerns relationship between different aspects of a phenomenon described by data: for example, "the larger the house, the higher its price" or "the closer the house to the city centre, the higher its price". In the perspective of case-based reasoning, we propose to consider monotonicity of the type "the more similar is y to x, the more credible is that y belongs to the same set as x". We show that rough approximations and decision rules induced from these approximations can be redefined in this context and that they satisfy the same fundamental properties of classical rough set theory.

By means of Artificial Intelligence, the system is capable of assessing, diagnosing and suggesting the best operation mode. One important Artificial Intelligence tool for automatic control is the use of fuzzy logic controllers, which are fuzzy rule-based systems comprising the expert knowledge in form of linguistic rules. These rules are usually constructed by an expert in the field of interest who can link the facts with conclusions. However, this way to work sometimes fails to obtain an optimal behavior. To solve this problem, within the framework of Machine Learning, some artificial intelligence techniques could be applied to enhance the controller behavior. In this work, a post-processing method is used to obtain more compact and accurate fuzzy logic. controllers. This method combines a new technique to perform an evolutionary lateral tuning of the linguistic variables with a simple technique for rule selection (that removes unnecessary rules). To do so, the tuning technique considers a new rule representation scheme by using the linguistic 2-tuples representation model which allows the lateral variation of the involved linguistic labels.

For example, in a n-class problem, c clusters are built for each of the classes. This results into n (.) c centroids. Then, new examples can be classified according to the nearest centroid. In this work we consider the problem of building classifiers using fuzzy clustering techniques. In particular, we consider the use of fuzzy c-means, as well as some variations. Namely, fuzzy c-means with variable size and entropy based fuzzy c-means.

DIALOG is organized into three views. The modeling view allows visual IP design. The specification view automatically outputs, from the design, the syntactic specification of the IPs in a declarative-type language called ACSL. This improves IP publication, localization and communication on the Web, as well as IP machine learning by agents. Finally, the implementation view provides a formal structural operational semantics (SOS) for the ACSL language. The paper focuses on the developed SOS, and shows how this semantics allows protocol property verification and eases automatic rule-based code generation from an ACSL specification for the purpose of simulating IP code execution at design time, as well as improving and assuring correct IP compliance at run time.

Computer vision can extend that map of the road ahead but desert road is notoriously similar to the surrounding desert. The CART algorithm (Classification and Regression Trees) provided a machine learning boost to find road while at the same time measuring when that road could not be distinguished from surrounding desert.

The goal is to automatically extract from the raw data the inner structure of a video collection so that a whole new range of applications to browse and search video collections can be derived out of this high-level segmentation. To reach this goal, we exploit techniques that consider the full spectrum of video content; it is fundamental to properly integrate technologies from the fields of computer vision, audio analysis, natural language processing and machine learning. In this paper, a multimodal feature vector providing a rich description of the audio, visual and text modalities is first constructed. Boosted Random Fields are then used to learn two types of relationships: between features and labels and between labels associated with various modalities for improved consistency of the results. The parameters of this enhanced model are found iteratively by using two successive stages of Boosting. We experimented using the TRECvid corpus and show results that validate the approach over existing studies.

We divide our system into two levels: shot level that assigns one of the pre-defined semantic tags to each input shot; and story level that performs story segmentation based on the output of the shot level and other temporal features. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by employing two machine-learning approaches at the story level. The first approach employs a statistical method called Hidden Markov Models (HMM) whereas the second uses a rule induction technique. We tested both approaches on similar to 120 hours of news video provided by TRECVID 2003. The results demonstrate that our 2-level machine-learning framework is effective and is adequate to cope with large-scale practical problems.

The effort concentrates on a novel machine-intelligence hybrid-of-hybrids decision support architecture termed FLASH (Fusion, Learning, Adaptive Super-Hybrid) we proposed. The highlights of FLASH discussed in the paper include its cognitive-processing orientation and the hybrid nature involving heterogeneous multiclassifier machine learning and approximate reasoning paradigms. Selected specifics of the FLASH internals, such as its feature selection techniques, supervised learning, clustering, recognition and reasoning methods, and their integration, are discussed. The results to date are presented, including the background type determination and bioattack detection computational experiments using data obtained with a multisensor fusion testbed we have also developed. The processing of imprecise information originating from sources other than sensors is considered. Finally, the paper discusses applicability of FLASH and its methods to complex battlespace management problems such as course-of-action decision support.

However, the collection of increased sensor data has resulted in an insufficient solution that includes faulty data points. Data analysis is needed to reduce nuisance and false alarms, which will improve officials' decision making and confidence levels in the system's alarms. Moreover, operational costs can be allayed and losses mitigated if authorities are alerted only when a real threat is detected. In the current system, heuristics such as persistence of alarm and type of sensor that detected an event are used to guide officials' responses. We hypothesize that fusing data from heterogeneous sensors in the sensor field can provide more complete situational awareness than looking at individual sensor data. We propose a two stage approach to reduce false alarms. First, we use self organizing maps to cluster sensors based on global positioning coordinates and then train classifiers on the within cluster data to obtain a local view of the event. Next, we train a classifier on the local results to compute a global solution. We investigate the use of machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbor, neural networks, and support vector machines to improve alarm accuracy. On simulated sensor data, the proposed approach identifies false alarms with greater accuracy than a weighted voting algorithm.

The difficulty can be traced to the fact that being accuracy driven, most algorithms lead to classifiers which are biased towards the majority class. Introducing in the learning algorithm misclassification costs, which differentiate between classes, has gone a long way towards improving the performance of the resulting classifiers. Alternatively, experiments have shown that a particular type of fuzzy classifiers apply better for imbalanced data sets. This paper explores the hypothesis that fuzzy classifiers can account to a certain extent for the error costs associated with other learning algorithms.

Our contribution focuses on two matters: first, a discussion about selecting the best features for a machine learning NER system. Second, an error study of this system which lead us to the creation of a set of general post-processing rules. These issues are explained in detail and then evaluated. The selection of features provides an improvement of around 2.3% over the results of our previous system while the application of the set of post-processing rules provides an increment of performance which is around 3.6%, reaching finally 83.37% f-score.

Identifying that two texts express the same meaning with different words is a challenging problem. We discuss the role of entailment for various Natural Language Processing applications and develop a machine learning system for their resolution. In our system, text similarity is based on the number of consecutive and non-consecutive word overlaps between two texts. The system is language and resource independent, as it does not use external knowledge resources such as WordNet, thesaurus, semantic, syntactic or part-of-speech tagging tools. In this paper all tests were done for English, but our system can be used with no restrains by other languages.

A machine-learning technique using advanced evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is developed instead of the more conventional approaches in the literature. This EA-based demand estimation framework is implemented into a model called the Dynamic Origin-Destination (O-D) Estimator (DynODE). The potential of EAs in the dynamic O-D estimation problem lies in their powerful global search and optimization capabilities. DynODE is integrated with an existing dynamic traffic assignment platform (e.g., DYNASMART-P). The EA-based methods in this study are further augmented with EA parallelization to improve the quality and efficiency of the solution. DynODE mainly addresses offline O-D estimation problems. However, online O-D estimation can be achieved with the parallel version of DynODE with sufficient multiprocessing and parallel computing. The developed approach is rigorously evaluated on a medium-sized real network to assess the effects of various parallel structures. For all experiments, savings in computation resources as well as. enhancement in the quality of solution were realized.

To this end, we collected human beauty ratings for data sets of facial images and used various techniques for learning the attractiveness of a face. The trained predictor achieves a significant correlation of 0.65 with the average human ratings. The results clearly show that facial beauty is a universal concept that a machine can learn. Analysis of the accuracy of the beauty prediction machine as a function of the size of the training data indicates that a machine producing human-like attractiveness rating could be obtained given a moderately larger data set.

J	Graf, ABA; Wichmann, FA; Bulthoff, HH; Scholkopf, B				Graf, ABA; Wichmann, FA; Bulthoff, HH; Scholkopf, B			Classification of faces in man and machine	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							OBJECT RECOGNITION; GENDER CLASSIFICATION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL-NETWORK; SHAPE; CATEGORIZATION; REPRESENTATION; MECHANISMS; PERCEPTRON	We attempt to shed light on the algorithms humans use to classify images of human faces according to their gender. For this, a novel methodology combining human psychophysics and machine learning is introduced. We proceed as follows. First, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) on the pixel information of the face stimuli. We then obtain a data set composed of these PCA eigenvectors combined with the subjects' gender estimates of the corresponding stimuli. Second, we model the gender classification process on this data set using a separating hyperplane (SH) between both classes. This SH is computed using algorithms from machine learning: the support vector machine (SVM), the relevance vector machine, the prototype classifier, and the K-means classifier. The classification behavior of humans and machines is then analyzed in three steps. First, the classification errors of humans and machines are compared for the various classifiers, and we also assess how well machines can recreate the subjects' internal decision boundary by studying the training errors of the machines. Second, we study the correlations between the rank-order of the subjects' responses to each stimulus-the gender estimate with its reaction time and confidence rating-and the rank-order of the distance of these stimuli to the SH. Finally, we attempt to compare the metric of the representations used by humans and machines for classification by relating the subjects' gender estimate of each stimulus and the distance of this stimulus to the SH. While we show that the classification error alone is not a sufficient selection criterion between the different algorithms humans might use to classify face stimuli, the distance of these stimuli to the SH is shown to capture essentials of the internal decision space of humans. Furthermore, algorithms such as the prototype classifier using stimuli in the center of the classes are shown to be less adapted to model human classification behavior than algorithms such as the SVM based on stimuli close to the boundary between the classes.

At the same time various machine learning methods have been used on relevance feedback tasks in Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR). One of the problems in typical techniques for relevance feedback is that they treat the relevant feedback and irrelevant feedback equally. In other words, the negative instances largely outnumber the positive instances. Hence, the assumption that they are balanced is incorrect. In this paper we study how MPM can be applied to image retrieval, more precisely, Biased MPM during the relevance feedback iterations. We formulate the relevance feedback based on a modified MPM called Biased Minimax Probability Machine (BMPM). Different from previous methods, this model directly controls the accuracy of classification of the future data to build up biased classifiers. Hence, it provides a rigorous treatment on imbalanced data. Mathematical formulation and explanations are provided for showing the advantages. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, in which encouraging and promising experimental results are obtained.

Clustering is an important tool for diversely intelligent systems. So, many works have been researched in the machine learning algorithms. But, some problems are still shown in the clustering. One of them is to determine the optimal number of clusters. In K-means algorithm, the number of cluster K is determined by the art of researchers. Another problem is an over fitting of learning models. The majority of learning algorithms for clustering are not free from the problem. Therefore, we propose a competitive co-evolving support vector clustering. Using competitive co-evolutionary computing, we overcome the over fitting problem of support vector clustering which is a good learning model for clustering. The number of clusters is efficiently determined by our competitive co-evolving support vector clustering. To verify the improved performances of our research, we compare competitive co-evolving support vector clustering with established clustering methods using the data sets form UCI machine learning repository.

However, the accurate load prediction remains a difficult task due particularly to the non-linear character of the time series and the periodical and seasonal patterns it exhibits. Several machine learning techniques such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been developed that are able to deal with nonlinear time series. However, the patterns of electricity demand change strongly and periodically with seasons, holidays and other factors. Therefore global models such as the SVM are not expected to perform well. In this paper we propose a new segmentation algorithm based on the Self Organizing Maps (SOM) to split the time series into homogeneous regions. Next, a linear SVM is locally trained in each region. The algorithm proposed has been applied to the prediction of the maximum daily electricity demand. The experimental results show that the new segmentation algorithm helps to improve several well known forecasting techniques.

Because cabinet approval rating estimation is an extremely complex process with much non-linearity, neural networks may give much better performance than conventional statistical methods. Though an attempt to infer public opinions seem to be a challenging topic for machine learning, little attempts have been made to infer approval ratings to our best knowledge. In this context, we try to apply information-theoretic competitive learning to the problem of cabinet approval ratings. Information-theoretic competitive learning has been developed so as to simulate competitive processes of neurons. One of the main characteristics of the method is that it is a very soft-type of competitive learning in which conventional competitive learning is only a special case. Though the method seems to be promising due to its general property, we have had a few experimental results to show better performance. Experimental results show that without any teacher information neural networks can appropriately infer the rise and fall of approval ratings through a process of information maximization. This experiment result surely opens up new perspectives for neural networks as well as mass communication studies.

In the proposed model, a BCD classifier is firstly applied to cluster the input data set into several subsets by the dynamics of load series in an unsupervised manner, and then, groups of 24 SVMs for the next day's electricity demand curve are used to fit the training data of each subset.

Breiman proposed Random Forest to classify a pattern based on CART tree algorithm and his method turns out good results compared to other classifiers. Taking advantages of Random Forest and using wrapper approach which was first introduced by Kohavi et. al, we propose an algorithm named Dynamic Recursive Feature Elimination (DRFE) to find the optimal subset of features for reducing noise of the data and increasing the performance of classifiers. In our method, we use Random Forest as induced classifier and develop our own defined feature elimination function by adding extra terms to the feature scoring. We conducted experiments with two public datasets: Colon cancer and Leukemia cancer. The experimental results of the real world data showed that the proposed method has higher prediction rate compared to the baseline algorithm. The obtained results are comparable and sometimes have better performance than the widely used classification methods in the same literature of feature selection.

I consists of two parts. One part is feature extraction by empirical kernel map and the other one is classification by LS-SVM. The main problem of earlier system is that it is not operated realtime because LS-SVM is executed in batch way. In this paper we propose an improved real time intrusion detection system incorporating earlier developed system with incremental LS-SVM. Applying the proposed system to KDD CUP 99 data, experimental results show that it has a remarkable feature feature extraction, classification performance and reducing detection time compared to earlier version of realtime ntrusion detection system.

Typically in the literature results are inconclusive but the investigators always suggest the possibility of further improvements, leaving the conclusion regarding the effectiveness of GP undecided. In this paper, we discuss a series of pretests, based on several variants of random search, aiming at giving more clear-cut answers on whether a GP scheme, or any other machine-learning technique, can be effective with the training data at hand. The analysis is illustrated with GP-evolved strategies for three stock exchanges exhibiting different trends.

The possibility of approximating within a desired precision any Borel measurable function guarantees the generality of the considered approach. The properties of the class of positive Boolean functions, realizable by digital circuits containing only AND and OR ports, is examined by considering a proper coding for ordered and nominal variables, which is able to preserve ordering and distance. In particular, it is shown that positive Boolean functions are universal approximators and can therefore be used in the solution of classification and regression problems.

The first suggestion from the thorough review of literature and our own work is that the use of artificial neural networks could be an effective method to resolve redundancy, time variability of system parameters, nonlinearities, and other biological effects that contribute to extremely high complexity that cannot be modeled by analytical tools with sufficient precision and details. The second suggestion is that the application of artificial neural networks is only one part of solution, and that at the actuator level of control (muscle activation) the dynamics of the biological systems must be included.

In a classifier system, the bucket brigade algorithm is used to solve the problem of credit assignment, which is a critical problem in the field of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a new approach to fuzzy classifier systems and a neuro-fuzzy system referred to as ACSNFIS to implement the proposed fuzzy classifier system. The proposed system is tested by the balancing problem of a cart pole and the back-driving problem of a truck to demonstrate its performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assuming that an opinion can be represented as a tuple (Subject, Attribute, Value), we propose a computational method to extract such tuples from texts. In this method, the main task is decomposed into (a) the process of extracting Attribute-Value pairs from a given text and (b) the process of judging whether an extracted pair expresses an opinion of the author. We apply machine-learning techniques to both subtasks. We also report on the results of our experiments and discuss future directions.

Recently, a number of neuroscience studies have suggested a relationship between reward-related activities in the brain and functions necessary for RL. Regarding the history of RL, we introduce in this article the theory of RL and present two engineering applications. Then we discuss possible implementations in the brain.

Such methods are intended to automate, at least in part, the laborious process of information integration, by which existing data sources are incorporated in a virtual database. Essentially, these methods scan new data sources, attempting to discover possible mappings to the virtual database. Like all discovery processes, this process is intrinsically probabilistic; that is, each discovery is associated with a specific value that denotes assurance of its appropriateness. Consequently, the rows in a discovered virtual table have mixed assurance levels, with some rows being more credible than others. We argue that rows in discovered virtual databases should be ranked, and we describe a ranking method, called TupleRank, for calculating such a ranking order. Roughly speaking, TupleRank calibrates the probabilities calculated during a discovery process with historical information about the performance of the system. The work is done in the framework of the Autoplex system for discovering content for virtual databases, and initial experimentation is reported and discussed.

Databases containing free-text clinical narratives reports often need to be retrieved to find relevant information for clinical and research purposes. Terms that appear in these documents tend to appear in different contexts. The context of negation, a negative finding, is of special importance, since many of the most frequently described findings are those denied by the patient or subsequently "ruled out." Hence, when searching free-text narratives for patients with a certain medical. condition, if negation is not taken into account, many of the documents retrieved will be irrelevant. In this paper we examine the applicability of a new pattern learning method for automatic identification of negative context in clinical narratives reports. We compare the new algorithm to previous methods proposed for the same task of similar medical narratives and show its advantages. The new algorithm can be applied also to further context identification and information extraction tasks.

However, training a SVM is very costly in terms of time and memory consumption when the data set is large. In contrast, the SVM decision function is fully determined by a small subset of the training data, called support vectors. Therefore, removing any training samples that are not relevant to support vectors might have no effect on building the proper decision function. In this paper, an effective hybrid method is proposed to remove from the training set the data that is irrelevant to the final decision function, and thus the number of vectors for SVM training becomes small and the training time can be decreased greatly. Experimental results show that a significant amount of training data can be discarded by our methods without compromising the generalization capability of SVM.

Computational detection of allergenic proteins attains a new level of accuracy with in silico variable-length peptide extraction and machine learning	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							PLANT FOOD ALLERGENS; IGE-BINDING EPITOPES; POTENTIAL ALLERGENICITY; CROSS-REACTIVITY; MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; POLLEN; CLASSIFICATION	The placing of novel or new-in-the-context proteins on the market, appearing in genetically modified foods, certain bio-pharmaceuticals and some household products leads to human exposure to proteins that may elicit allergic responses. Accurate methods to detect allergens are therefore necessary to ensure consumer/patient safety. We demonstrate that it is possible to reach a new level of accuracy in computational detection of allergenic proteins by presenting a novel detector, Detection based on Filtered Length-adjusted Allergen Peptides (DFLAP). The DFLAP algorithm extracts variable length allergen sequence fragments and employs modern machine learning techniques in the form of a support vector machine. In particular, this new detector shows hitherto unmatched specificity when challenged to the Swiss-Prot repository without appreciable loss of sensitivity. DFLAP is also the first reported detector that successfully discriminates between allergens and non-allergens occurring in protein families known to hold both categories. Allergenicity assessment for specific protein sequences of interest using DFLAP is possible via ulfh@slv.se.

This work develops an integrated database, miRNAMap, to store the known miRNA genes, the putative miRNA genes, the known miRNA targets and the putative miRNA targets. The known miRNA genes in four mammalian genomes such as human, mouse, rat and dog are obtained from miRBase, and experimentally validated miRNA targets are identified in a survey of the literature. Putative miRNA precursors were identified by RNAz, which is a non-coding RNA prediction tool based oncomparative sequence analysis. The mature miRNA of the putative miRNA genes is accurately determined using a machine learning approach, mmiRNA. Then, miRanda was applied to predict the miRNA targets within the conserved regions in 3'-UTR of the genes in the four mammalian genomes. The miRNAMap also provides the expression profiles of the known miRNAs, cross-species comparisons, gene annotations and cross-links to other biological databases. Both textual and graphical web interface are provided to facilitate the retrieval of data from the miRNAMap. The database is freely available at http://mirnamap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.

B	Castellani, M			IEEE	Castellani, M.			A neural network approach for remote detection of marine eddies	OCEANS 2006 - ASIA PACIFIC, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	Oceans 2006-Asia Pacific Conference	MAY 16-19, 2006	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE				This paper presents a machine learning approach for detection of Mediterranean water eddies from sea surface temperature maps of the Atlantic Ocean. Two methods based on texture analysis of the satellite imagery are evaluated. Given a map point, the first method extracts information on the surrounding thermal gradient and arranges it as a numerical vector of gradient angles. The second method uses Laws, algorithm to create a vector of numerical measures of structural features. In both the cases, a neural network is trained to recognise those numerical patterns that reveal the presence of eddy structures. Both the algorithms achieve high recognition accuracy and fast and robust learning results. Particularly important are the very low rates of false detections obtained, since eddies occupy only a small portion of the ocean area. Compared to Laws' method, the gradient-based algorithm gives comparable recognition accuracies with a lower design effort and at reduced computational costs. The simple and modular structure of the gradient-based method also compares favorably to the complexity other algorithms for identification of marine phenomena published in the literature. Given the competitive accuracy results obtained, the gradient-based approach may be preferable to the currently employed techniques since it is simpler and more easily reconfigurable.

Hand writting wrappers is tedious and error prone. Constant changes in the web, also implies that wrappers need to be constantly refactored. Machine learning has proven to be useful, but current techniques are either limited in expressivity, require non-intuitive user interaction or do not allow for nary extraction. We study using tree-patterns as an n-ary extraction language and propose an algorithm learning such queries. It calculates the most information-conservative tree-pattern which is a generalization of two input trees. A notable aspect is that the approach allows to learn queries containing both child and descendant relationships between nodes. More importantly, the proposed approach does not require any labeling other than the data which the user effectively wants to extract. The experiments reported show the effectiveness of the approach.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to solve this issue relying on classified instance exchange and inductive reasoning. This approach is based on the idea that, whenever two (or more) software entities need to align their ontologies (which amounts, from the point of view of each entity, to add one or more new concept definitions to its own ontology), it is possible to learn the new concept definitions starting from shared individuals (i.e. individuals already described in terms of both ontologies, for which the entities have statements about classes and related properties); these individuals, arranged in two sets of positive and negative examples for the target definition, are used to solve a learning problem which as solution gives the definition of the target concept in terms of the ontology used for the learning process. The method has been applied in a preliminary prototype for a small multi-agent scenario (where the two entities cited before are instantiated as two software agents). Following the prototype presentation, we report on the experimental results we obtained and then draw some conclusions.

The selected intelligent methodologies are briefly described and explained, and then, the acquired results are presented and discussed for their comprehensibility and usefulness to medical staff, either for fault diagnosis tasks, or for the construction of automated computer-assisted classification of smears. The intelligent methodologies used for the construction of pap-smear classifiers, are different clustering approaches, feature selection, neuro-fuzzy systems, inductive machine learning, genetic programming, and second order neural networks. Acquired results reveal the power of most intelligent techniques to obtain high quality solutions in this difficult problem of medical diagnosis. Some of the methods obtain almost perfect diagnostic accuracy in test data, but the outcome lacks comprehensibility. On the other hand, results scoring high in terms of comprehensibility are acquired from some methods, but with the drawback of achieving lower diagnostic accuracy. The experimental data used in this study were collected at a previous stage, for the purpose of combining intelligent diagnostic methodologies with other existing, computer imaging technologies towards the construction of an automated smear cell classification device.

Genetic programming and inductive machine learning have been applied, in order to produce meaningful diagnostic rules for the medical staff. The data used in the experiments correspond to information acquired from two images of each breast of the patient, along with some associated patient information such as the age at time of study. Similar datasets have been previously used in an attempt to facilitate the development of computer algorithms to aid screening. Experienced screening radiologists have double-read the screening mammograms, they have weighted the malignancy ratings and averaged out the levels of suspiciousness assigned to each finding in the screenings. The diagnostic rules which were obtained from both genetic programming and machine learning have been evaluated in detail and then analyzed and discussed by collaborative medical experts, in parallel to findings from related literature. Results seem encouraging for further use and analysis by medical staff specializing in screening mammography.

Learning to deduplicate	Opening Information Horizons			English	Proceedings Paper	6th ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL)	JUN 11-15, 2006	Chapel Hill, NC	ACM SIGIR, IEEE TC DL		deduplication; digital libraries; genetic programming	INTEGRATION	Identifying record replicas in Digital Libraries and other types of digital repositories is fundamental to improve the quality of their content and services as well as to yield eventual sharing efforts. Several deduplication strategies are available, but most of them rely on manually chosen settings to combine evidence used to identify records as being replicas. In this paper, we present the results of experiments we have carried out with a novel Machine Learning approach we have proposed for the deduplication problem. This approach, based on Genetic Programming (GP), is able to automatically generate similarity functions to identify record replicas in a given repository. The generated similarity functions properly combine and weight the best evidence available among the record fields in order to tell when two distinct records represent the same real-world entity. The results of the experiments show that our approach outperforms the baseline method by Fellegi and Sunter by more than 12% when identifying replicas in a data set containing researcher's personal data, and by more than 7%, in a data set with article citation data.

Current digital libraries do not provide users tools, to retrieve documents based on the information available within the figures. We propose an architecture for retrieving documents by integrating figures and other information. The initial step in enabling integrated document search is to categorize figures into a set of pre-defined types. We propose several categories of figures based on their functionalities in scholarly articles. We have developed a machine-learning-based approach for automatic categorization of figures. Both global features, such as texture, and part features, such as lines, are utilized in the architecture for discriminating among figure categories.

To take advantage of this ability requires software used by physicians to be capable of displaying and accessing volumetric data as well as supporting post processing in order to access important quantitative information such as thickness maps and segmented volumes. We describe our clinical FD-OCT system used to acquire 3D data from the human retina over the macula and optic nerve head. B-scans are registered to remove motion artifacts and post-processed with customized 3D visualization and analysis software. Our analysis software includes standard 3D visualization techniques along with a machine learning support vector machine (SVM) algorithm that allows a user to semi-automatically segment different retinal structures and layers. Our program makes possible measurements of the retinal layer thickness as well as volumes of structures of interest, despite the presence of noise and structural deformations associated with retinal pathology. Our software has been tested successfully in clinical settings for its efficacy in assessing 3D retinal structures in healthy as well as diseased cases. Our tool facilitates diagnosis and treatment monitoring of retinal diseases.

Past sensor network research has focused on security and communication, but largely ignored the overall dynamic resource management issue of such distributed systems. Our contribution is in integrated control optimization and resource management algorithms to ensure proper functioning of distributed sensors in extremely limited bandwidth, power, and storage. In this paper, we present a novel genetic algorithm (GA) for real-time system control and resource management that handles multiple conflicting objectives and constraints in the distributed system. We suggest using a GA-based predictive controller to give optimal actions that account for future states and future possible events while estimating the optimal control action policy. Our framework is suitable for dynamic environments where the desired system performance and resource usage changes dynamically while being constrained by limited amount of resources.

Traditional methods for pathogen identification require complicated sample preparation for reliable results. Previously, we have reported development of a noninvasive optical forward-scattering system for rapid identification of Listeria colonies grown on solid surfaces. The presented system included application of computer-vision and pattern-recognition techniques to classify scatter pattern formed by bacterial colonies irradiated with laser light. This report shows an extension of the proposed method. A new scatterometer equipped with a high-resolution CCD chip and application of two additional sets of image features for classification allow for higher accuracy and lower error rates. Features based on Zernike moments are supplemented by Tchebichef moments, and Haralick texture descriptors in the new version of the algorithm. Fisher's criterion has been used for feature selection to decrease the training time of machine learning systems. An algorithm based on support vector machines was used for classification of patterns. Low error rates determined by cross-validation, reproducibility of the measurements, and robustness of the system prove that the proposed technology can be implemented in automated devices for detection and classification of pathogenic bacteria.

In order to build a pratical system, a dictionary with reasonable size is necessary. The initial dictionary is built from the Penn Chinese Treebank corpus v4.0 and contains only 33,438 entries. Since the initial dictionary is quite small, unknown word detection methods are applied to a huge raw text in order to extract new words to be added into the system dictionary. We have successfully constructed a dictionary with 120,769 entries. Finally, we propose a two-layer morphological analyzer to cater for two sets of outputs. The first layer produces the minimal segmentation units defined by us, and the second layer transforms the output of the first layer to the original segmentation units defined by Penn Chinese Treebank.

Our goal is to develop a bidirectional English-Filipino Machine Translation (MT) system using a hybrid approach to learn rules from examples. The first phase was an English to Filipino MT system that required several. language resources. The problem lies on its dependency over the annotated grammar which is currently unavailable for Filipino, which makes reverse translation impossible. Phase 2 addresses this limitation by using information taken from English and Filipino POS Taggers. The seed rules are generated by aligning the POS tags from English and Filipino examples, including their constraints. To perform compositionality, the system deduces the constituent labels by using the longest adjacent POS tags found in both the English and Filipino rule. The system groups together similar rules and generalizes it to encompass a wider range of unseen examples.

Machine learning can improve prediction of severity in acute pancreatitis using admission values of APACHE II score and C-reactive protein	PANCREATOLOGY			English	Article						acute pancreatitis; machine learning; severity; APACHE; prediction	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; INTENSIVE-CARE UNIT; ANTIBIOTIC-PROPHYLAXIS; ACTIVATION PEPTIDE; DOUBLE-BLIND; MANAGEMENT; OBESITY; SERUM; PATHOGENESIS; COMBINATION	Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) has a variable course. Accurate early prediction of severity is essential to direct clinical care. Current assessment tools are inaccurate, and unable to adapt to new parameters. None of the current systems uses C-reactive protein (CRP). Modern machine-learning tools can address these issues. Methods: 370 patients admitted with AP in a 5-year period were retrospectively assessed; after exclusions, 265 patients were studied. First recorded values for physical examination and blood tests, aetiology, severity and complications were recorded. A kernel logistic regression model was used to remove redundant features, and identify the relationships between relevant features and outcome. Bootstrapping was used to make the best use of data and obtain confidence estimates on the parameters of the model. Results: A model containing 8 variables ( age, CRP, respiratory rate, pO(2) on air, arterial pH, serum creatinine, white cell count and GCS) predicted a severe attack with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82 (SD 0.01). The optimum cut-off value for predicting severity gave sensitivity and specificity of 0.87 and 0.71 respectively. The predictions were significantly better ( p = 0.0036) than admission APACHE II scores in the same patients (AUC 0.74) and better than historical admission APACHE II data ( AUC 0.68 - 0.75). Conclusions: This system for the first time combines admission values of selected components of APACHE II and CRP for prediction of severe AP.

They rely on the fact that i) linear learning can be formalized as a well-posed optimization problem; ii) nonlinear learning can be brought into linear learning thanks to the kernel trick and the mapping of the initial search space onto a high dimensional feature space. The kernel is designed by the ML expert and it governs the efficiency of the SVM approach. In this paper, a new approach for the automatic design of kernels by Genetic Programming, called the Evolutionary Kernel Machine (EKM), is presented. EKM combines a well-founded fitness function inspired from the margin criterion, and a co-evolution framework ensuring the computational scalability of the approach. Empirical validation on standard ML benchmark demonstrates that EKM is competitive using state-of-the-art SVMs with tuned hyper-parameters.

In this study, we suggest an approach to predict the pattern of N-myristoylation signal using the machine learning system BONSAI. BONSAI finds rules in combination of an alphabet indexings and decision trees. Computational experiments with BONSAI classified amino acid residues depending on effect for N-myristoylation and found rules of the alphabet indexing. In addition, BONSAI suggested new requirements for the position of an amino acid in N-myristoylation signal.

We focus on the prediction of alpha helices and show that by using HM-SVMs, a simple 7-state HMM with 302 parameters can achieve a Q(alpha) value of 77.6% and a SOV alpha value of 73.4%. As detailed in an accompanying technical report [11], these performance numbers are among the best for techniques that do not rely on external databases (such as multiple sequence alignments).

However, this assumption is not satisfied, for example, when the outside of training region is extrapolated. The situation where the training input points and test input points follow different distributions is called the covariate shift. Under the covariate shift, standard machine learning techniques such as empirical risk minimization or cross-validation do not work well since their unbiasedness is no longer maintained. In this paper, we propose a new method called importance-weighted cross-validation, which is still unbiased even under the covariate shift. The usefulness of our proposed method is successfully tested on toy data and furthermore demonstrated in the brain-computer interface, where strong non-stationarity effects can be seen between calibration and feedback sessions.

Given that users activate a subset of functionality across devices to accomplish a particular task, it is attractive to consider a remote control directly supporting this behavior. We present qualitative and quantitative results from a study of two promising approaches to creating such a remote control: end-user programming and machine learning. In general, results show that each approach possesses advantages and disadvantages, and that neither is optimal.

From the acoustic environment we can infer the types of activity, communication modes and other actors involved in the activity. Environmental or background noise can be classified with a high degree of accuracy using recordings from microphones commonly found in PDAs and other consumer devices. We describe an acoustic environment recognition system incorporating an adaptive learning mechanism and its use in a noise tracker. We show how this information is exploited in a mobile context framework.

Empirical OPC rule inference for rapid RET application	Photomask Technology 2006, Pts 1 and 2	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	26th Annual BACUS Symposium on Photomask Technology	SEP 19-22, 2006	Monterey, CA	BACUS, SPIE		OPC; RET; inverse lithography; neural networks; model-based; rule inference; machine learning		A given technological node (45 nm, 65 nm) can be expected to process thousands of individual designs. Iterative methods applied at the node consume valuable days in determining proper placement of OPC features, and manufacturing and testing mask correspondence to wafer patterns in a trial-and-error fashion for each design. Repeating this fabrication process for each individual design is a time-consuming and expensive process. We present a novel technique which sidesteps the requirement to iterate through the model-based OPC analysis and pattern verification cycle on subsequent designs at the same node. Our approach relies on the inference of rules from a correct pattern at the wafer surface it relates to the OPC and pre-OPC pattern layout files. We begin with an offline phase where we obtain a "gold standard" design file that has been fab-tested at the node with a prepared, post-OPC layout file that corresponds to the intended on-wafer pattern. We then run an offline analysis to infer rules to be used in this method. During the analysis, our method implicitly identifies contextual OPC strategies for optimal placement of RET features on any design at that node. Using these strategies, we can apply OPC to subsequent designs at the same node with far faster runtimes and pattern fidelity comparable to that of the original design file. The technique promises to offer a rapid and accurate complement to existing RET application strategies.

Since this classifier achieves very good performance for most benchmark data sets used in machine learning, it was very interesting to check its performance in speaker identification which is a slightly different problem. Comparison of achieved identification accuracy with popular modeling techniques in speaker recognition like Gaussian mixture models and vector quantization is made. All research is based on Polish speech corpus ROBOT, which is designed for testing speech algorithms. Identification results are discussed.

However, in some cases, the real sources of the errors are the design of aircraft, e.g. the pilot was confused with the different fuel systems across different models in the same manufacture. The failed collaboration between human operators and the systems therefore has been a major concern for aviation industries. Aviation accident reports are critical information sources to understand how to prevent or reduce such problematic collaboration. In particular, the portions of the reports describing how the behaviour of human operators deviated from an established norm and how the design of aircraft systems contributed to this deviation are particularly important. However, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task to manually extract such information from the reports. One reason is that current accident reports do not aim specifically at capturing the information in format easily accessible for aircraft designers. Therefore, an automatic approach that identifies the sentences describing Human Errors and Design Errors is needed. A preliminary test using hand-crafted cue phrases, i.e. a special word or phrases that are used to indicate the types of sentences, showed a limited identification performance. Therefore, a machine learning technique that uses a greater variety of the linguistic features of the cue phrases than the pre-defined ones and makes the identification decisions based on the combinations these features, looks promising. The examples of the features are active or passive sentence styles and the position of keywords in the sentence. This paper presents the results of developing such automastic identification approach.

Rough set theory has been witnessed great success in attribute reduction. A series of reduction algorithms were constructed for all kinds of applications based on rough set models. There is usually more than one reduct for some real world data sets. It is not very clear which one or which subset of the reducts should be selected for learning. Neither experimental comparison nor theoretic analysis was reported so far. In this paper, we will review the proposed attribute reduction algorithms and reduction selection strategies. Then a series of numeric experiments are presented. The results show that, statistically speaking, the classification systems trained with the reduct with the least features get the best generalization power in terms of single classifiers. Furthermore, Good performance is observed from combining the classifiers constructed with multiple reducts compared with Bagging and random subspace ensembles.

The goal of this study is to automatically find the definition for a Chinese abbreviation in the context where both the abbreviation and its definition occur, enforcing the constraint of one sense per discourse for an abbreviation. First, the candidate abbreviation-definition pairs are collected, and then a SVM approach using context information is employed to classify candidate abbreviation-definition pairs so that the pairs can be identified. The performance of the approach is evaluated on a manually annotated test corpus, and is also compared with two other machine learning approaches: Maximum Entropy and Decision Tree. Experimental results show that our approach reaches a good performance.

It is necessary to select and implement innovative tools able to handle the huge amount of available data concerning territorial systems in order to extract useful information from them to enhance the quality of evaluation procedure for urban/territorial planning. This paper selects some tools derived from Artificial Intelligence, and incorporated GIS through the elaboration of various types of available data, to extract and build knowledge directly from experimental data and also to represent the extracted knowledge very effectively and communicatively, in the form of sets of spatial transformation rules. It describes the structure of the data mining tools which are most suitable for applications in the field of urban planning, aimed at discovering the transformation rules driving the evolution of cities in special of metropolitan in analysis.

However, it has also been observed that, for some datasets, the classification accuracy delivered by the SVM is very sensitive to how the cost parameter and the kernel parameters are set. As a result, the user may need to conduct extensive cross validation in order to figure out the optimal parameter setting. How to expedite the model selection process of the SVM has attracted a high degree of attention in the machine learning research community in recent years. This paper proposes an advanced data reduction algorithm aimed at expediting the model selection process of the SVM. Experimental results reveal that the proposed mechanism is able to deliver a speedup of over 70 times without causing meaningful side effects and compares favorably with the alternative approaches.

Such empirical hardness models have previously been studied for complete, deterministic search algorithms. In this work, we demonstrate that such models can also make surprisingly accurate predictions of the run-time distributions of incomplete and randomized search methods, such as stochastic local search algorithms. We also show for the first time how information about an algorithm's parameter settings can be incorporated into a model, and how such models can be used to automatically adjust the algorithm's parameters on a per-instance basis in order to optimize its performance. Empirical results for Novelty(+) and SAPS on structured and unstructured SAT instances show very good predictive performance and significant speedups of our automatically determined parameter settings when compared to the default and best fixed distribution-specific parameter settings.

This paper discusses various techniques which can be used to perform statistical analysis for categorical data, especially in the form of log-linear analysis and logistic regression over partitioned databases, while limiting confidentiality concerns. We show how ideas from the current literature that focus on "secure" summations and secure regression analysis can be adapted or generalized to the categorical data setting.

They lack of grammar, have no strict format, and even don't have complete sentences. Presently, the information in TCM medical cases is extracted based on structured templates. This process requires the experts to take part in. Moreover, each of the experts has their own characteristics. If we use uniform templates to describe the TCM medical cases, they will not only result the loss of some information, but also not reflect the every expert's idea perfectly. In this paper, a method of automatically generating extraction patterns from TCM medical cases, EPTCMR, is proposed, which is based on ontology in the domain of TCM.

Two types of local Cartesian coordinates are first introduced to calculate the next position of the robots by the evolutionary algorithm, and then the reactive behaviors for each group of stimulus are designed by employing the behavior-based technique. The selected position corresponding to each stimulus is stored as knowledge and shared by all of the robots. In this sense, the robots can learn the skill to deal with collision. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed scheme.

In factored classification the class, label is factored into a vector of class features. A topic-based mixture model to factored classification of text documents in which each document is assumed to be generated by a mixture of class features is presented. Another three algorithms based on Naive Bayes model are compared with the topic-based mixture model.

Breiman's Bagging (bootstrap aggregation) provides diversity ensembles by sub-sampling the existing training set using a method called bootstrap. However, when the number of ensemble size is small, bootstrap can't generate perfect training sets to improve ensemble diversity. In this paper, we bring a new resample method called balanced bootstrap. It can produce more ideal training sets than ones generated by bootstrap, which will be use to increase the ensemble diversity. Based on balanced bootstrap, a novel algorithm called 3BEL (Balanced Bootstrap Based Ensemble Learning) is proposed to generate more diverse ensembles than Bagging. Empirical studies on a wide range of UCI data sets show that 3BEL yields ensemble with higher accuracy than Bagging, while using a smaller ensemble size.

We adopt a support vector machine as the main algorithm because of the restriction of the size of corpus. First, some special words were collected for constructing a wordlist. These words are considered as the characteristic of sentiment. Secondly, we extracted the information about these words of the reviews as the training data for the SVM which will build a classifier. Then the classifier can be used for predicting the semantic orientation. 144 reviews downloaded from Internet are used as the training and test data for this system. The algorithm achieves a high accuracy of 85.4% when evaluated these reviews, and it is much better than the baseline accuracy of 68.7%.

Integrating two or more reasoning techniques becomes a trend in developing intelligent diagnosis. In this paper we discuss the intelligent diagnosis problems and propose a diagnosis architecture for composite systems, which combines rule-based diagnosis and model-based diagnosis. These two diagnosis programs not only work efficiently with machine learning in different stages of the fault diagnosis process, but also efficiently improve the process by making the best use of their individual advantages.

Semi-supervised learning is very useful in these fields since it combines labeled and unlabeled data to boost performance of learning algorithms. Many semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed, among which the "co-training" algorithms are widely used. We present a new co-training strategy. It uses random subspace method to form an initial ensemble of classifiers, where each classifier is trained with different subspace of the original feature space. Unlike the prior work of Blum and Mitchell on co-training, using two redundant and sufficient views, our method uses an ensemble of classifiers. Each classifier's predictions on new unlabeled data are combined and used to enlarge the training set of others. The ensemble classifiers are refined through the enlarged training set. Experiments on UCI data sets show that when the number of labeled data is relatively small, our method performs better than the data dimensionality.

At present, it is widely accepted that in general, associative classification has higher accuracy and better robustness than decision tree classification. However, associative classification has some deflects such as slow performance, huge memory usage and large-size classifying model. In this paper, a new idea is proposed to mine main points of knowledge in relational databases based on class association rules, which can be successfully used for fast, accurate and robust classification.

Compared with conventional extension matrix techniques, it is more powerful and practical to handle with ambiguities in classification problems. Rule extraction from Fuzzy extension matrix involves three parameters alpha, beta and gamma. These parameters play an importation role in the entire process of rule extraction based on FEM. They greatly affect the computation of fuzzy entropy and extract rules, however those important parameter value are usually estimated based on users by domain knowledge, personal experience and requirements. This paper introduces an approach to optimization of the three parameters based GA, and provides some theoretical support of directly selection of the parameter values through experiment. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: by combining GA and local search methods, we can get the reasonable parameters. Five data sets from the UCI Machine Learning database are employed in the study. Experimental results and discussions are given.

CIL reuses the old models of the classifier and learns only one binary sub-classifier with an additional phase of feature selection when a new class comes. In the testing phase, current classifier is applied to the vectors' projections on the sub-spaces concerned. CIL can serve as a flexible approach for all binary classification algorithms in that classification. Our experiment shows that the CIL-based SVM was not only substantially faster in training time than the popular batch SVM learning methods such as 1-against-root, 1-against-1 and divide-by-2 but also almost competed to the best performances in effectiveness of them.

Firstly, conditional random fields (CRF) is presented as a new kind of discriminative sequential model, it can incorporate many rich features, and well avoid the label bias problem that is the limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMM) and other discriminative finite-state models. Secondly, support vector machine is improved to adapt the sequential tagging task. Finally, these improved models and other existing models are combined together, which have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results show that CRF approach achieves 0.70% improvement in POS tagging and 0.67% improvement in shallow parsing. Moreover, our combination method achieves F-measure 93.73% and 93.69% in above two tasks respectively, which is better than any sub-model.

Unfortunately, many anomaly web-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) take on higher false alarm rate (FAR) and false negative rate (FNR). In this paper, we build this system using Adaboost, a prevailing machine learning algorithm, and its detecting model adopts a dynamic load-balancing algorithm, which can avoid packet loss and false negatives in high-performance web severs with handling heavy traffic loads in real-time and can enhance the efficiency of detecting work. The experiments demonstrate that our system can achieve an especially low false positive rate (approximating 0.3%) and false negative rate (approaching 0.4%) while keeping an extremely low computational complexity.

Considerable amount of researches have been focused on multi-modal analysis to detect multimedia semantics. However, two fundamental issues have not been adequately addressed. First, given a set of raw features extracted from multimedia sources, what are the best independent modalities? Second, once a set of modalities has been identified, how are they optimally fused to map to the high-level semantics? In this paper, we apply statistical and machine learning techniques to answer the two questions. ISOMAP combining with support vector clustering are used to discover independent modalities from raw features. Then Maximum Entropy method is applied to optimally fuse the individual modalities. Experiments show that the proposed method can learn multimedia semantics more efficiently than traditional methods.

This quantitative measure computes the expectation of absolute output deviations due to input perturbation with respect to all possible inputs. This is an important first step to the study of the statistical output sensitivity measure of multilayer perceptron neural networks. The major contribution of this work is the relaxation of the restriction of the input having uniform distributions in our early studies. Therefore, the novel sensitivity measure is applicable to real world applications such as machine learning problems. Furthermore, experimental results show that the new sensitivity measure is suitable to the networks with large input dimension.

This particular procedure will transform continuous variables into discrete ones, when dealing with continuous inputs with probabilistic and uncertain nature. Based on the FBN, the fuzzy reasoning model for prediction and diagnosis can be designed. To validate our method, two models are built and used to classify the astrocytoma malignant degree, which can be modeled by probability quantitatively. The experiment results show that the model fusing both low-level image features and high-level semantics outperforms the one only using low-level image features with very promising results. This FBN model also provides knowledge expression in predicting astrocytoma malignant level. This study provides a novel objective method to quantitatively assess the astrocytoma malignancy level that can be used to assist doctors to diagnose the tumor.

SVM is considered as two layers learning machine since it maps the original space into a high dimensional feature space, i.e., input layer and high dimensional feature space layer. If the high dimensional feature space layer is considered as a new problem's input layer and the new problem is also solved by SVM, the new problem can be solved by SVMs named Multi-Layer SVM (MLSVM). MLSVM is composed of input layer and at least one layer high dimensional feature space layer. In this paper, m-th order ordinary differential equations are solved by MLSVM for regression. Experimental results indicate that MLSVM can effectively solve the problem of ordinary differential equations. Thus, MLSVM exhibits its great potential to solve other complex problems.

And these features are often separately selected and learned by machine learning methods. In this paper, the relation between distinct features obtained by different feature extraction approaches. and that for the same original images were studied by Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA). We apply a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in the learnt semantic space of the combined features and compare against SVM on the raw data and previously published state-of-the-art results. Experiments show that significant improvement is achieved with the SVM in the semantic space in comparison with direct SVM classification on the raw data.

It is based on a machine learning architecture that rapidly estimates pose angles from multi-pose face images. By combining principal component analysis (PCA) of the shape feature and context feature respectively in eigenspace, we can get new eigenvectors to represent the human face pose. Support vector machine (SVM) has the optimal hyperplane that the expected classification error for unseen test samples is minimized. We utilize CPCA-SVM technology to get the optimal results for face pose discrimination. The experiment results demonstrated that the proposed approach is more stable and applicable in dynamic system. Accurate pose discrimination helps to select optimal pose and improve recognition rate in multi-route dynamic face recognition system.

General methodologies are fit for extracting the differences between HTML documents of web pages; however, it cannot be used to tell the actual distance, between the content of web pages and the facade displayed in internet explorers. Previously, content distance, style distance, and hybrid distance have been proposed to make measurement result more practical.

The entire control system architecture integrates sensory modules, modeling modules, and control modules. The latter are composed by (i) a high level simulation and autonomous execution unit that is capable for on-fine multi-robot navigation with collision avoidance, (ii) a trajectory tracking unit for manipulation purposes, and (iii) a low level position controller that performs position control exploiting machine learning algorithms. The high level controllers take into account behaviors specific to the micro-scale. The performance of the layered control system is evaluated through simulations and preliminary hardware experiments on a micro-robotic platform. The application domain of the MiCRoN platform is cell manipulation, and 3-D assembly for micro-fabrication.

As a result of the rising number of control parameters and ever shorter development times, the aim in this context is to develop automated intelligent setting strategies for test design. In doing so, it is imperative to find a range of settings at which the engine works safely (adjustment range). This paper presents a method for determining adjustment range limits in engine measurement for high dimensional parameter spaces using the support vector machines (SVM). SVMs are a relatively new method in machine learning and are applied to learn a hull that models the unknown, actual test space on the basis of measurement points.

While, in rough set theory, the discretization of continuous attributes is indispensable in any data preprocessing for the rough set computational intelligence algorithm and also critical to the quality of rule generated. To solve this problem, and based on the available researching achievements, we introduce the Self-Organizing feature Map (SOM) to cluster the original data into the required classes. In this paper, to direct the SOM clustering number of every continuous attribute, based on the indiscernibility discipline in Rough Set Theory, we define two new measurements-attribute Maximum Discernibility Value (MDV) and Attribute Redundancy Rate (ARR) as the strategic searching factros. MDV is employed to decide the heuristic strategy for the SOM neural network in the data preprocessing stage. And the ARR is for the attribute reduction as a effective feedback to the SOM clustering. Independent of domain experience, the combination of MDV, SOM, Skowron reduction, and the ARR can adjust the clustering number for every continuous attirbute automatically. Therefore, in theory, the computational speed is heightened greatly for the rough set attribute reduction. And in the end, a factual application case demonstrates the whole process effectively.

This information allows us to investigate the protein interaction network from a systematic point of view. However, experimentally determined interactions are susceptible to errors. A previous assessment estimated that only similar to 10% of the interactions can be supported by more than one independent experiment, and about half of the interactions may be false positives. These false positives might unnecessarily link unrelated proteins, resulting in huge apparent interaction clusters, which complicate elucidation for the biological importance of these interactions. Address this problem, we present an approach to integrate, assess and characterize all available protein-protein interactions in model organisms yeast and fly. We first integrate all available protein-protein interaction databases of yeast and fly, and merge all the datasets. We then use machine learning techniques to score the reliability for each interaction, and to rigorously validate the scoring scheme of yeast protein-protein interactions from different aspects.

These errors commonly arise from an inability to sequence through peak height variations in DNA sequencing traces from the Sanger sequencing method. Recent efforts toward improving basecalling accuracy have taken the form of more sophisticated digital filters and feature detectors. We demonstrate that the variation in peak heights itself encodes novel information which can be used for basecalling. To isolate this information for a clear demonstration, we perform a peculiar blind basecalling experiment using ABI processed output. Using classifiers responding to measurements in the context of the basecalling position, we call bases without reference to the peak heights at the basecalling position itself. Tree classifiers indicate which features are pertinent, and the application of neural nets to these features results in a startlingly high initial success rate of 78%. Our analysis indicates that we can make viable basecalls using information that has never been accessed before.

Researchers still have little understanding of what the various degrees of difficulty are for various tasks, and how they affect travel and activity behaviour [1], [2]. This paper focuses on the research for the development of a new travel aid to increase the independent mobility of disabled and elderly people in potentially unfamiliar environments by providing useful information both before and during travelling. The route planning and navigation system consists mainly of four interrelated components: the module to assist travellers in pre-planning their journeys, the module to execute these plans to provide users with general information, orientation and navigation assistance during journeys. The route planning system itself consist of a geo-coding routine [11], a fuzzy decision system to eliminate unfeasible pathways in dependence of the type of disability and another fuzzy decision system to select a mobile equipment according to the users handicaps. The k-best paths are found using a modification of the well-known A*-algorithm. The study employs social science techniques to investigate and quantify urban barriers, and computer technologies to translate these into an operational route assessment and modelling package, using dynamic segmentation and network analysis techniques. This tool is to be applied and tested in Georgenthal, Germany.

Many data analysis approaches such as data mining, information retrieval and machine learning have been used to extract frequent patterns from diverse biological databases. However, the discrepancies, due to the differences in the structure of databases and their terminologies, result in a significant lack of interoperability. Although ontology-based approaches have been used to integrate biological databases, the inconsistent analysis of biological databases has been greatly disregarded. This paper presents a method by which to measure the degree of inconsistency between biological databases. It not only presents a guideline for correct and efficient database integration, but also exposes high quality data for data mining and knowledge discovery.

Neural network machine learning is a popular approach to address such a problem of structural bioinformatics. In this paper, we describe a new neural network model for P-turn prediction that accounts for site-specific amino acid preference, a property ignored in previous training models. We showed that the statistics of amino acid preference at specific sites within and around a P-turn is rather significant, and incorporation of this property helps improve the network performance. Furthermore, by contrasting with a previous model, we revealed a deficiency of not incorporating this site-specific property in previous models.

This paper presents a prototype sentiment-based meta search engine that has been developed to perform sentiment categorization of Web search results. It assists users to quickly focus on recommended or non-recommended information by classifying Web search results into four categories: positive, negative, neutral, and non-review documents. It does this by using an automatic classifier based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM). This paper also discusses various issues we have encountered during the prototype development, and presents our approaches for resolving them. A user evaluation of the prototype was carried out with positive responses from users.

In accordance with this methodology, any set of online signatures as vector signals of individual length is represented by a two-argument function which measures the pairwise similarity between respective signals and possesses the properties of a kernel, i.e. inner product in a hypothetical linear space. Since the SVM principle completely predefines the algorithms of both training and recognition, it remains only to choose a kernel produced by an appropriate metric in the set of signatures, so that the genuine signatures of the same person would be much closer to each other than those of different persons. However, different viewpoints of signature similarity lead, a priori, to different kernels. We propose a principle of fusing several kernels into an entire training and verification technique. Experiments with the data base of the World Signature Verification Competition 2004 have shown that multi-kernel verification essentially decreases the error rate in comparison with decision rules based on single kernels.
