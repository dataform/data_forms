Our methodology is based on the application of several data mining methods and returns an adaptive normal daily model of the network traffic as a result of four main steps, which are illustrated in the paper. The original observation units (the network connections) are transformed in symbolic objects and the normal model itself is given by a particular set of symbolic objects. A new symbolic object is considered an anomaly if it is dissimilar from those belonging to the model and it can be added to the model if it is ranked as a changing point, i.e. a new but legal behavior of the network traffic, otherwise it is an outlier, i.e. a new but illegal aspect of the network traffic. The obtained model of network connections can be used by a network administrator to identify deviations in network traffic patterns that may demand for her attention. The methodology is applied to the firewall logs of our Department network.

Boosting algorithms are considered stronger than bagging and dagging on noise-free data. However, there are strong empirical indications that bagging and dagging are much more robust than boosting in noisy settings. For this reason, in this work we built an ensemble using a voting methodology of bagging, boosting and dagging ensembles with 8 sub-classifiers in each one. We performed a comparison with simple bagging, boosting and dagging ensembles with 25 sub-classifiers, as well as other well known combining methods, on standard benchmark datasets and the proposed technique had better accuracy in most cases.

It searches for a small number of simple classification rules from a large number of candidate rules. The effectiveness of genetic rule selection strongly depends on the choice of candidate rules. If we have hundreds of thousands of candidate rules, it is very difficult to efficiently search for their good subsets. On the other hand, if we have only a few candidate rules, rule selection does not make sense. In this paper, we examine the use of Pareto-optimal and near Pareto-optimal rules with respect to support and confidence as candidate rules in genetic rule selection.

However, sensor data are subject to several sources of errors as the data captured from the physical world through these sensor devices tend to be incomplete, noisy, and unreliable, thus yielding imprecise or even incorrect and misleading answers which can be very significative if they result in immediate critical decisions or activation of actuators. Traditional data cleaning techniques cannot be applied in this context as they do not take into account the strong spatial and temporal correlations typically present in sensor data, so machine learning techniques could greatly be of aid. In this paper, we propose a neuro-fuzzy regression approach to clean sensor network data: the well known ANFIS model is employed for reducing the uncertainty associated with the data thus obtaining a more accurate estimate of sensor readings. The obtained cleaning results show good ANFIS performance compared to other common used model such as kernel methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness if the cleaning model has to be implemented at sensor level rather than at base-station level.

As one approach to efficient similarity search, we focus on utilizing a set of pivots for reducing the number of similarity calculations between a query and each object in a database. In this paper, unlike conventional methods based on combinatorial optimization, we propose a new method for learning a set of pivots from existing data objects, in virtue of iterative numerical nonlinear optimization. In our experiments using one synthetic and two real data sets, we show that the proposed method significantly reduced the average number of similarity calculations, compared with some representative conventional methods.

An information theoretic approach to feature selection has been applied in order to determine the best subset of features by means of a proper backward selection algorithm. The final aim of the research is the implementation of a prognostic tool able to reduce the risk for the air pollutants concentrations to be above the alarm thresholds fixed by the law. The implementation of this tool will be carried out using machine learning methods based on some of the most widespread statistical data driven techniques (Artificial Neural Networks, ANN, and Support Vector Machines, SVM).

Clustering is also usually accompanied by functional characterization of gene sets by assessing statistical enrichments of structured vocabularies, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) [1]. If different cluster sets are generated for correlated experiments, a machine learning step termed cluster meta-analysis may be performed, in order to discover relations among the components of such sets. Several approaches have been proposed for this step: in particular, kernel methods may be used to exploit the graphical structure of typical ontologies such as GO. Following up the formulation of such approach [2], in this paper we present and discuss further results about its applicability and its performance, always in the context of the well known Spellman's Yeast Cell Cycle dataset [3].

We propose a representation which takes into account the syntactic information and allows for using different machine learning methods. To carry out the syntactic analysis, three parsers, LinkParser, Minipar and Charniak parser were used. The results we have obtained are comparable to the performance of relation learning systems in the biomedical domain and in some cases out-perform them. In addition, we have studied the impact of ensemble methods on learning relations using the representation we proposed. Given that recall is very important for the relation learning, we explored the ways of improving it. It has been shown that ensemble methods provide higher recall and precision than individual classifiers alone.

While the experimental methodology employed in machine learning has improved much over the years, repeatability of experiments and generalizability of results remain a concern. In this paper we propose a methodology based on the use of experiment databases. Experiment databases facilitate large-scale experimentation, guarantee repeatability of experiments, improve reusability of experiments, help explicitating the conditions under which certain results are valid, and support quick hypothesis testing as well as hypothesis generation. We show that they have the potential to significantly increase the ease with which new results in machine learning can be obtained and correctly interpreted.

These trends necessitate the development of automatic methods for finding relevant information to include in specialized databases. We show how to use a comprehensive database (SwissProt) as a source of new entries for a specialized database (TCDB, the Transport Classification Database). Even carefully constructed keyword-based queries perform poorly in determining which SwissProt records are relevant to TCDB; we show that a machine learning approach performs well. We describe a maximum-entropy classifier, trained on SwissProt records, that achieves high precision and recall in cross-validation experiments. This classifier has been deployed as part of a pipeline for updating TCDB that allows a human expert to examine only about 2% of SwissProt records for potential inclusion in TCDB. The methods we describe are flexible and general, so they can be applied easily to other specialized databases.

We seek machine learning incident detection solutions that reduce the need for manual adjustments by taking advantage of massive databases of traffic sensor network measurements. First, we show that a rather straightforward supervised learner based on the SVM model outperforms a fixed detection model used by state-of-the-art traffic incident detectors. Second, we seek further improvements of learning performance by correcting misaligned incident times in the training data. The misalignment is due to an imperfect incident logging procedure. We propose a label realignment model based on a dynamic Bayesian network to re-estimate the correct position (time) of the incident in the data. Training on the automatically realigned data consistently leads to improved detection performance in the low false positive region.

This assumption might be violated when the training and test data come from different time periods or domains. In such situations, traditional machine learning methods not aware of the shift of distribution may fail. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, namely bridged refinement, to take the shift into consideration. The algorithm corrects the labels predicted by a shift-unaware classifier towards a target distribution and takes the mixture distribution of the training and test data as a bridge to better transfer from the training data to the test data. In the experiments, our algorithm successfully refines the classification labels predicted by three state-of-the-art algorithms: the Support Vector Machine. the naive Bayes classifier and the Transductive Support Vector Machine on eleven data sets. The relative reduction of error rates is about 50% in average.

Human fraud auditors often utilize fraud detection methods that, exploit structure in database tables to uncover outliers that may be part of a fraud case. From the uncovered outliers, an auditor will build a case of fraud by searching data related to the outlier possibly across many different databases and tables within these different databases. This paper illustrates an industrial implementation of an adaptive fraud case building system that uses machine learning to conduct the search and decision-making process with an automated outlier detection component. This system was successfully applied to uncover fraud cases in real marketing data.

That is, each class represents a particular topic, e.g., sports and politics. However, many real-world problems require more refined classification based on some semantic perspectives. For example, in a set of sentences about a disease, some may report outbreaks of the disease, some may describe how to cure the disease, and yet some may discuss how to prevent the disease. To classify sentences at this semantic level, the traditional bag-of-words model is no longer sufficient. In this paper, we study semantic sentence classification of disease reporting. We show that both keywords and sentence semantic features are useful. Our results demonstrated that this integrated approach is highly effective.

J	Golub, K; Hamon, T; Ardo, A				Golub, Koralika; Hamon, Thierry; Ardo, Anders			Automated classification of textual documents based on a controlled vocabulary in engineering	KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION			English	Article							CATEGORIZATION	Automated subject classification has been a challenging research issue for many years now, receiving particular attention in the past decade due to rapid increase of digital documents. The most frequent approach to automated classification is machine learning. It, however, requires training documents and performs well on new documents only if these are similar enough to the former. We explore a string-matching algorithm based on a controlled vocabulary, which does not require training documents-instead it reuses the intellectual work put into creating the controlled vocabulary. Terms from the Engineering Information thesaurus and classification scheme were matched against title and abstract of engineering papers from the Compendex database. Simple string-matching was enhanced by several methods such as term weighting schemes and cut-offs, exclusion of certain terms, and enrichment of the controlled vocabulary with automatically extracted terms. The best results are 76% recall when the controlled vocabulary is enriched with new terms, and 79% precision when certain terms are excluded. Precision of individual classes is up to 98%. These results are comparable to state-of-the-art-machine-learning algorithms.

By employing the estimation results, agents can modify their own ways in order to achieve an agreement much quicker or to look after much higher benefits for themselves. Some of estimation strategies have been proposed by researchers to predict agents' behaviors, and most of them are based on machine learning mechanisms. However, when the application domains become open and dynamic, and agent relationships are complicated, it is difficult to train data which can be used to predict all potential behaviors of all agents in a multi-agent system. Furthermore because the estimation results may have errors, a single result maybe not accurate and practical enough in most situations. In order to address these issues mentioned above, we propose a power regression analysis mechanism to predict partners' behaviors in this paper. The proposed approach is based only on the history of the offers during the current negotiation and does not require any training process in advance. This approach can not only estimate a particular behavior, but also an interval of behaviors according to an accuracy requirement. The experimental results illustrate that by employing the proposed approach, agents can gain more accurate estimation results on partners' behaviors by comparing with other two estimation functions.

There are many literatures focusing on misclassification cost and test cost at present. In real world application, however, the issue of time-sensitive should be considered in cost-sensitive learning. In this paper, we regard the cost of time-sensitive in cost-sensitive learning as waiting cost (referred to WC), a novelty splitting criterion is proposed for constructing cost-time sensitive (denoted as CTS) decision tree for maximal decrease the intangible cost. And then, a hybrid test strategy that combines the sequential test with the batch test strategies is adopted in CTS learning. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the other ones with respect to decrease in misclassification cost.

As a result, more computational and storage capabilities are added to accommodate ever more demanding applications. Unfortunately, adding more resources typically comes on the expense of higher energy costs. New chip design with Multiple Clock Domains (MCD) opens the opportunity for fine-grain power management within the processor chip. When used with dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), we can control the voltage and power of each domain independently. A significant power and energy improvement has been shown when using MCD design in comparison to managing a single voltage domain for the whole chip, as in traditional chips with global DVS. In this paper, we propose PACSL a Power-Aware Compiler-based approach using supervised Learning. PACSL automatically derives an integrated CPU-core and on-chip L2 cache DVS policy tailored to a specific system and workload. Our approach uses supervised machine learning to discover a policy, which relies oil monitoring a few performance counters. We present our approach detailing the role of a compiler in constructing a custom power management policy. We also discuss some implementation issues associated with our technique. We show that PACSL improves on traditional power management techniques that are used in general MCD chips. Our technique saves 22% on average (up to 46%) in energy-delay product over a DVS technique that applies independent DVS decisions in each domain. Compared to no-power management, our technique improves energy-delay product by 26% on average (up to 64%).

This paper focus on the analysis of how maximally general and accurate rules, regardless of the encoding, can be evolved in a such classifier systems. The theoretical analysis of maximally general and accurate rules using two different binary rule encoding schemes showed some theoretical results with clear implications to the scalability of any genetic-based machine learning system that uses the studied encoding schemes. Such results are clearly relevant since one of the binary representations studied is widely used on Pittsburgh-style classifier systems, and shows an exponential shrink of the useful rules available as the problem size increases. In order to be able to perform such analysis we use a simple barebones Pittsburgh classifier system-the compact classifier system (CCS)-based on estimation of distribution algorithms.

We suggest a novel principle (LoRP) for model selection in regression and classification. It is based on the loss rank, which counts how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better. LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized maximum likelihood variants (AIC,BIC,MDL), LoRP only depends on the regression functions and the loss function. It works without a stochastic noise model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like kNN.

Five dififerent force levels were used: 10, 30, 50, 70 and 100% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), with each recording lasting 5 seconds. The amplitude of SEMG recordings was processed using dyadic Haar wavelet and entropy metrics. In each scale, the entropy of transformed SEMG was calculated and a set of 80 features per subject was formed. From existing data, we created five dataset, where subject were labelled based on the type as: normal/abnormal, normal/myopathic, normal/neuropathic, myopathic/neuropathic and normal/myopathic/neuropathic. Five classfication techniques from the WEKA machine learning package were used, i.e. decision trees j48, random trees, random decision forests, support vector machines and ensemble of support vector machine with polynomial kernel. Resulting classifiers were obtained by using 3-fold cross-validation with 50 iterations for every machine learning technique. Classification accuracy and deviation of 150 classifiers for each dataset and machine learning technique were computed. The results show that normal and neuropathic groups are the most distinguishable (79 +/- 8%), while myopathic and neuropathic groups are most hardly distinguished (50 +/- 15%). Other classifications scored normal/abnormal (64 +/- 11%), normallmyopathic (73 70116), normal/neuropathic/myopathic (63 +/- 18 %). The results are quite promising, taking into account that only the SEMG amplitude was considered. The introduced method can be further upgraded with a decomposition technique which would extract individual motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) from SEMG signal, so that also their properties would be used in classification criteria.

One goal is to develop methods for learning in the wild, the accretion of new knowledge by combinations of machine learning and recorded social gestures. Social bookmarking provides one kind of recorded social gesture that, when combined with machine learning techniques, avail learning in the wild opportunities. We explore the informal ontologies of social bookmarking processes as recorded in a subject map. We apply the same thinking to federation of formal ontologies. We will illustrate the opportunities gained through subject-centric knowledge representation and organization. In the larger picture, we are exploring techniques for federation of heterogeneous world views.

Attention is given to the handling of both raw corpus data and annotated corpus data. With regard to the latter it is shown how, with a minimum of human effort, machine learning techniques can be employed to obtain part-of-speech tagged corpora that can be used for lexicographic purposes. All points are illustrated with data drawn from English and Northern Sotho. The tools and techniques themselves, however, are language-independent, and as Such the encouraging outcomes of this study are far-reaching.

The cloud model can transform numerical data to qualitative concept described by a group of characteristics. It provides a new way for concept induction in machine learning. Classification of single trial EEG recorded in a 'self-paced key typing' experiment is made through feature extraction based on cloud model and linear regression method for the classification of feature vectors. Results of up to 90% classification accuracy on test data set were obtained. The results show that compared with other methods, the feature extraction and translation method for EEG classification in this paper is simple and effective.

Inferring the everyday task capabilities of locations	LOCATION- AND CONTEXT-AWARENESS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Location- and Contest-Awareness (LoCA 2007)	SEP 20-21, 2007	Oberpfaffenhofen, GERMANY	German Aerosp Ctr, Intel			REMINDERS	People rapidly learn the capabilities of a new location, without observing every service and product. Instead they map a few observations to familiar clusters of capabilities. This paper proposes a similar approach to computer discovery of routine location capabilities, applying machine learning to predict unobserved capabilities based on a combination of a small body of local observations and a larger body of data that is not specific to the location. We propose using the time and place of deleting items from a to-do list application to provide the local data. For reminder purposes, an area within easy walking distance is a single location, but may contain many different shops and services, collectively offering its own combination of capabilities. Truncated singular value decomposition maps the observations to combinations of features, rather than to a single cluster. Simulations, using distributions derived from real world data, demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

Some theoretical understanding of when they work is available, but a definite answer seems to be lacking. This paper derives distributions that maximizes the statewise difference to the respective product of marginals. These distributions are, in a sense the worst distribution for predicting an outcome of the data generating mechanism by independence. We also restrict the scope of new theoretical results by showing explicitly that, depending on context, independent ('Naive') classifiers can be as bad as tossing coins. Regardless of this, independence may beat the generating model in learning supervised classification and we explicitly provide one such scenario.

This paper proposes a set of algorithms that allow the integration of data from multiple datasets that are related, as well as results from the implementation of these techniques using data from the field of Predictive Toxicology. The results show significant improvements when related data is used to aid in the model creation process, both overall and in specific data ranges. The proposed algorithms have potential for use within any field where multiple datasets exist, particularly in fields combining computing, chemistry and biology.

Effective and dependable selection procedures are of vital importance to machine learning and data mining. The suggested approach is based on the multiple agent paradigm. The authors propose using JABAT middleware as a tool and the original instance reduction procedure as a method for selecting reference vectors under multiple objectives. The paper contains a brief introduction to the multiple objective optimization, followed by the formulation of the multiple-objective, agent-based, reference vectors selection optimization problem. Further sections of the paper provide details on the proposed algorithm generating a non-dominated (or Pareto-optimal) set of reference vector sets. To validate the approach the computational experiment has been planned and carried out. Presentation and discussion of experiment results conclude the paper.

Linear subspace methods are the commonly used ones, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FDA), et al. In this paper, we describe a novel feature extraction method for binary classification problems. Instead of finding linear subspaces, our method finds lower-dimensional affine subspaces for data observations. Our method can be understood as a generalization of the Fukunaga-Koontz Transformation. We show that the proposed method has a closed-form solution and thus can be solved very efficiently. Also we investigate the information-theoretical properties of the new method and study the relationship of our method with other methods. The experimental results show that our method, as PCA and FDA, can be used as another preliminary data-exploring tool to help solve machine learning and data mining problems.

A comparative study of unsupervised machine learning and data mining techniques for intrusion detection	Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition	JUL 18-20, 2007	Leipzig, GERMANY				OUTLIERS	During the past number of years, machine learning and data mining techniques have received considerable attention among the intrusion detection researchers to address the weaknesses of knowledgebase detection techniques. This has led to the application of various supervised and unsupervised techniques for the purpose of intrusion detection. In this paper, we conduct a set of experiments to analyze the performance of unsupervised techniques considering their main design choices. These include the heuristics proposed for distinguishing abnormal data from normal data and the distribution of dataset used for training. We evaluate the performance of the techniques with various distributions of training and test datasets, which are constructed from KDD99 dataset, a widely accepted resource for IDS evaluations. This comparative study is not only a blind comparison between unsupervised techniques, but also gives some guidelines to researchers and practitioners on applying these techniques to the area of intrusion detection.

Recently, associative classifiers which utilize association rules have been widely studied. Indeed, the associative classifiers often outperform the traditional classifiers. In this case, it is important to collect high quality (association) rules. Many algorithms find only high support rules, because decreasing the minimum support to be satisfied is computationally demanding. However, it may be effective to collect low support but high confidence rules. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that produces a wide variety of 100% confident rules including low support rules. To achieve this goal, we adopt a specific-to-general rule searching strategy, in contrast to the previous many approaches. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracies in several datasets taken from UCI machine learning repository.

In this paper, an improved method for gait recognition is proposed. The proposed work introduces a nonlinear machine learning method, kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), to extract gait features from silhouettes for individual recognition. Binarized silhouette of a motion object is first represented by four 1-D signals which are the basic image features called the distance vectors. The distance vectors are differences between the bounding box and silhouette, and extracted using four projections to silhouette. Classic linear feature extraction approaches, such as PCA, LDA, and FLDA, only take the 2-order statistics among gait patterns into account, and are not sensitive to higher order statistics of data. Therefore, KPCA is used to extract higher order relations among gait patterns for future recognition. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is employed as a preprocessing step to achieve translation invariant on the gait patterns accumulated from silhouette sequences which are extracted from the subjects walk in different speed and/or different time. The experiments are carried out on the CMU and the USF gait databases and presented based on the different training gait cycles. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is comparatively illustrated to take into consideration the published gait recognition approaches.

This has lead to test methods based on semiartificially produced test data, often produced by ad hoc techniques complemented by statistical models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The quality of such a test method depends on how well the test data reflect the regularities in known data and how well they generalize these regularities. So far only very simplified and generalized, artificial data sets have been tested, and a more thorough statistical foundation is required. We propose to use logic-statistical modelling methods for machine-learning for analyzing existing and manually marked up data, integrated with the generation of new, artificial data. More specifically, we suggest to use the PRISM system developed by Sato and Kameya. Based on logic programming extended with random variables and parameter learning, PRISM appears as a powerful modelling environment, which subsumes HMMs and a wide range of other methods, all embedded in a declarative language. We illustrated these principles here, showing parts of a model under development for genetic sequences and indicate first initial experiments producing test data for evaluation of existing gene finders, exemplified by GENSCAN, HMMGene and genemark.hmm.

Several computer techniques have been developed to aid radiologists to improve their performance in the detection and diagnosis of breast abnormalities. In Point Pattern Analysis, there is a statistic known as Ripley's K function that is frequently applied to Spatial Analysis in Ecology, like mapping specimens of plants. This paper proposes a new way in applying Ripley's K function to classify breast masses from mammogram images. The features of each nodule image are obtained through the calculate of that function. Then, the samples gotten are classified through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as benign or malignant masses. SVM is a machine-learning method, based on the principle of structural risk minimization, which performs well when applied to data outside the training set. The best result achieved was 94.94% of accuracy, 92.86% of sensitvity and 93.33% of specificity.

The underlying idea is that instead of classifying objects into their respective classes, we classify object pairs either as equivalent (belonging to the same class) or non-equivalent (belonging to different classes). The method is based on a vectorisation of the similarity between the objects and the application of a machine learning algorithm (SVM, ANN, LogReg, Random Forests) to learn the differences between equivalent and non-equivalent object pairs, and define a, unique kernel function that can be obtained via equivalence learning. Using a small dataset of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic 3-phosphoglycerate-kinase sequences we found that the classification performance of equivalence learning slightly exceeds those of several simple machine learning algorithms at the price of a minimal increase in time and space requirements.

We adopt a machine learning approach where the mapping between input and target documents is learned from a training corpus of documents. We first introduce a general stochastic model of semi structured documents generation and transformation. This model relies on the concept of meta-document which is a latent variable providing a link between input and target documents. It allows us to learn the correspondences when the input documents are expressed in a large variety of schemas. We then detail an instance of the general model for the particular task of HTML to XML conversion. This instance is tested on three different corpora using two different inference methods: a dynamic programming method and an approximate LaSO-based method.

We approach this task using a novel Delta-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation model. We model execution traces attributed to failed runs of a program as being generated by two types of latent topics: normal usage topics and bug topics. Execution traces attributed to successful runs of the same program, however, are modeled by usage topics only. Joint modeling of both kinds of traces allows us to identify weak bug topics that would otherwise remain undetected. We perform model inference with collapsed Gibbs sampling. In quantitative evaluations on four real programs, our model produces bug topics highly correlated to the true bugs, as measured by the Rand index. Qualitative evaluation by domain experts suggests that our model outperforms existing statistical methods for bug cause identification, and may help support other software tasks not addressed by earlier models.

The proposed classifier, named level learning set (LLS), has the ability to classify general datasets including sparse and non sparse data. It moves developments in vision segmentation into general machine learning by utilising and extending level set-based active contour models from the field of computer vision to construct decision boundaries in any feature space. This model has advantages over traditional classifiers in its ability to directly construct complex decision boundaries, and in better knowledge representation. Various experimental results including comparisons to existing machine learning algorithms are presented, and the advantages of the proposed approach are discussed.

This allows the embedding of discrete structures into vectorial spaces, where all the classical pattern recognition and machine learning methods can be applied. The proposed approach is based on eigenanalysis of extended vectorial representations of the input structures and substructures. One problem with the approach is that eigenanalysis can be computationally quite demanding when considering large datasets of structured objects. In this paper we propose a general approach for reducing the computational burden. Experimental results show a significant speed-up of the computation.

Sparsity means that we are provided with a small data set and a high number of unknown components of the system, most of which are zero. Under these circumstances, a model needs to be learned that fits the underlying system, capable of generalization. This corresponds to the student-teacher setting in machine learning. In the first part of this paper we introduce a learning algorithm, based on L-1-minimization, to identify interaction networks from poor data and analyze its dynamics with respect to phase transitions. The efficiency of the algorithm is measured by the generalization error, which represents the probability that the student is a good fit to the teacher. In the second part of this paper we show that from a system with a specific system size value the generalization error of other system sizes can be estimated. A comparison with a set of simulation experiments show a very good fit.

In this paper, we propose a novel scale-space based boosting framework which applies scale-space theory for choosing the optimal regressors during the various iterations of the boosting algorithm. In other words, the data is considered at different resolutions for each iteration in the boosting algorithm. Our framework chooses the weak regressors for the boosting algorithm that can best fit the current resolution and as the iterations progress, the resolution of the data is increased. The amount of increase in the resolution follows from the wavelet decomposition methods. For regression modeling, we rise logitboost update equations based on first derivative of the loss function. We clearly manifest the advantages of using this scale-space based framework for regression problems and show results on different real-world regression datasets.

CSRoulette is based on cost proportional roulette sampling technique (called CPRS in short). CSRoulette is closely related to Costing, another cost-sensitive meta-learning algorithm, which is based on rejection sampling. Unlike rejection sampling which produces smaller samples, CPRS can generate different size samples. To further improve its performance, we apply ensemble (bagging) on CPRS; the resulting algorithm is called CSRoulette. Our experiments show that CSRoulette outperforms Costing and other meta-learning methods in most datasets tested. In addition, we investigate the effect of various sample sizes and conclude that reduced sample sizes (as in rejection sampling) cannot be compensated by increasing the number of bagging iterations.

This modification, aimed at overfitting reduction, restricts the set of possible values of weights to a discrete subset of real numbers, leading to much better generalization abilities of the network. This, in turn, leads to higher accuracy and a decrease in error rate by over 50% in extreme cases (when overfitting is high). Discretization is performed nondeterministically, so as to keep expected value of discretized weight equal to original value. In this way, global behavior of original algorithm is preserved. The presented method of discretization is general and may be applied to other machine-learning algorithms. It is also an example of how an algorithm for continuous optimization can be successfully applied to optimization over discrete spaces. The method was evaluated experimentally in WEKA environment using two real-world data sets from UCI repository.

With the increased distribution and virtualization of resources in the next generation network infrastructure, novel resource management approaches are sought for effective service delivery. In this paper, we propose a market-based hierarchical resource management mechanism using Machine Learning, which consists of a negotiation phase where customers are allocated the resources needed by their activated service instances, and a learning phase where service providers adjust the prices of their resources in order to steer the network infrastructure towards the desired goal of increasing their revenues, while delivering the mix of services requested by their customers. We present the operation of such a market where distributed and virtualized resources are traded as commodities between autonomic resource brokers performing the negotiation and learning on behalf of service providers. We perform extensive simulations to study the performance of the proposed hierarchical resource management mechanism.

In order to reduce the computational time requirements while retaining the high reliability of predicting near-optimal structures, we employ two efficiency-enhancement techniques: (1) hybridizing eCGA with a local search method, and (2) seeding the initial population with lowest energy structures of a smaller cluster. The proposed method is exemplified by optimizing silicon clusters with 4-20 atoms. The results indicate that the population size required to obtain near-optimal solutions with 98% probability scales sub linearly (as Theta(n(0.83))) with the cluster size. The total number of function evaluations (cluster energy calculations) scales sub-cubically (as Theta(n(2.45))), which is a significant improvement over exponential scaling of poorly designed evolutionary algorithms.

Manual landmarking is performed on a small subset of the shapes in the study, and a machine learning approach is used to elucidate the characteristic shape and appearance features at each landmark. A classifier trained using these features defines a cost function that drives key landmarks to anatomically meaningful locations after MDL-based correspondence establishment. Results are shown for artificial examples as well as real data.

We model a category of shapes as a finite dimensional manifold which we approximate using Diffusion maps. Our method computes a Delaunay triangulation of the reduced space, considered as Euclidean, and uses the resulting space partition to identify the closest neighbors of any given shape based on its Nystrom extension. We derive a non-linear shape prior term designed to attract a shape towards the shape prior manifold at given constant embedding. Results on shapes of ventricle nuclei demonstrate the potential of our method for segmentation tasks.

It employs a generic machine learning framework and provides objective breast density measures quantifying the specific biological effects of interest. In several illustrative experiments on data from a clinical trial, it is shown that the proposed method can quantify effects caused by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at least as good as standard methods. Most interestingly, the separation of subpopulations using our approach is considerably better than the best alternative, which is interactive.

While CAD systems can achieve high sensitivity, their limited specificity has hindered clinical acceptance. To overcome this problem, we propose a false positive reduction (FPR) system based on image processing and machine learning to reduce the number of false positive lung nodules identified by CAD algorithms and thereby improve system specificity. To discriminate between true and false nodules, twenty-three 3D features were calculated from each candidate nodule's volume of interest (VOI). A genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM) were then used to select an optimal subset of features from this pool of candidate features. Using this feature subset, we trained an SVM classifier to eliminate as many false positives as possible while retaining all the true nodules. To overcome the imbalanced nature of typical datasets (significantly more false positives than true positives), an intelligent data selection algorithm was designed and integrated into the machine learning framework, thus further improving the FPR rate. Three independent datasets were used to train and validate the system. Using two datasets for training and the third for validation, we achieved a 59.4% FPR rate while removing one true nodule on the validation datasets. In a second experiment, 75% of the cases were randomly selected from each of the three datasets and the remaining cases were used for validation. A similar FPR rate and true positive retention rate was achieved. Additional experiments showed that the GA feature selection process integrated with the proposed data selection algorithm outperforms the one without it by 5%-10% FPR rate. The methods proposed can be also applied to other application areas, such as computer-aided diagnosis of lung nodules.

For instance, a radiologist examining a suspicious mass could study labeled mammograms with similar conditions and weigh the outcome of their biopsy results before determining whether to recommend a biopsy. The fundamental challenge in developing ISAD systems is the identification of similar cases, not simply in terms of superficial image characteristics, but in a medically-relevant sense. This task involves three aspects: extraction of a representative set of features, identifying an appropriate measure of similarity in the high -dimensional feature space, and return the most similar matches at interactive speed. The first has been an active research area for several decades. The second has largely been ignored by the medical imaging community. The third can be achieved using the Diamond framework, an open-source platform that enables efficient exploration of large distributed complex data repositories. This paper focuses on the second aspect. We show that the choice of distance metric affects the accuracy of an ISAD system and that machine learning enables the construction of effective domain-specific distance metrics. In the learned distance, data points with the same labels (e.g., malignant masses) are closer than data points with different labels (e.g., malignant vs. benign). Thus, the labels of the near neighbors of a new case are likely to be informative. We present and evaluate several novel methods for distance metric learning and evaluate them on a database involving 2522 mass regions of interest (ROI) extracted from digital mammograms, with ground truth defined by biopsy results (1800 malignant, 722 benign). Our results show that learned distance metrics improve both classification (ROC curve) and retrieval performance.

Although many algorithms have been proposed, it is challenging to achieve an automatic clinical organ segmentation which requires speed and robustness. Automatically segmenting cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image is extremely challenging due to the artifacts of cardiac motion and characteristics of MRI. Moreover many of the existing algorithms are specific to a particular view of cardiac MRI images. We proposed a generic view-independent, learning-based method to automatically segment cardiac MRI images, which uses machine learning techniques and the geometric shape information. A main feature of our contribution is the fact that the proposed algorithm can use a training set containing a mix of various views and is able to successfully segment any given views. The proposed method consists of four stages. First, we partition the input image into a number of image regions based on their intensity characteristics. Then, we calculate the pre-selected feature descriptions for each generated region and use a trained classifier to learn the conditional probabilities for every pixel based on the calculated features. In this paper, we use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to train our classifier. The learned conditional probabilities of every pixel are then fed into an energy function to segment the input image. We optimize our energy function with graph cuts. Finally, domain knowledge is applied to verify the segmentation. Experimental results show that this method is very efficient and robust with respect to image views, slices and motion phases. The method also has the potential to be imaging modality independent as the proposed algorithm is not specific to a particular imaging modality.

The purpose of this work was to develop a methodology for fully automated voxel-by-voxel classification of airways, fissures, nodules, and vessels from chest CT images using a single feature set and classification method. Twenty-nine thin section CT scans were obtained from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). Multiple radiologists labeled voxels corresponding to the following structures: airways (trachea to 6th generation), major and minor lobar fissures, nodules, and vessels (hilum to peripheral), and normal lung parenchyma. The labeled data was used in conjunction with a supervised machine learning approach (AdaBoost) to train a set of ensemble classifiers. Each ensemble classifier was trained to detect voxels part of a specific structure (either airway, fissure, nodule, vessel, or parenchyma). The feature set consisted of voxel attenuation and a small number of features based on the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix (used to differentiate structures by shape) computed at multiple smoothing scales to improve the detection of both large and small structures. When each ensemble classifier was composed of 20 weak classifiers, the AUC values for the airway, fissure, nodule, vessel, and parenchyma classifiers were 0.984 +/- 0.011, 0.949 +/- 0.009, 0.945 +/- 0.018, 0.953 +/- 0.016, and 0.931 +/- 0.015 respectively.

In training process, we train AdaBoosted histogram classifiers to classify true boundary positions and false ones on the 1-D intensity profiles of lesion regions. In segmenting process, given a marker indicating a rough location of a lesion, the proposed solution segments its region automatically by using the trained AdaBoosted histogram classifiers. If there are imperfects in the segmented result, based on one correct location designated by the user, the solution does the segmentation again and gives a new satisfied result. There are two novelties in our approach. The first is that we use AdaBoost in the training process to learn diverse intensity distributions of lesion regions, and utilize the trained classifiers successfully in segmenting process. The second is that we present a reliable and user-friendly way in segmenting process to rectify the segmented result interactively. Dynamic programming is used to find a new optimal path. Experimental results show our approach can segment lesion regions successfully, despite the diverse intensity distributions of the lesion regions, marker location variability and lesion region shape variability.

Automated methods to delineate brain structures of interest are required to analyze large amounts of imaging data like that being collected in several on going multi-center studies. We have previously reported on using artificial neural networks (ANN) to define subcortical brain structures including the thalamus (0.88), caudate (0.85) and the putamen (0.81). In this work, apriori probability information was generated using Thirion's demons registration algorithm. The input vector consisted of apriori probability, spherical coordinates, and an iris of surrounding signal intensity values. We have applied the support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm to automatically segment subcortical and cerebellar regions using the same input vector information. SVM architecture was derived from the ANN framework. Training was completed using a radial-basis function kernel with gamma equal to 5.5. Training was performed using 15,000 vectors collected from 15 training images in approximately 10 minutes. The resulting support vectors were applied to delineate 10 images not part of the training set. Relative overlap calculated for the subcortical structures was 0.87 for the thalamus, 0.84 for the caudate, 0.84 for the putamen, and 0.72 for the hippocampus. Relative overlap for the cerebellar lobes ranged from 0.76 to 0.86. The reliability of the SVM based algorithm was similar to the inter-rater reliability between manual raters and can be achieved without rater intervention.

However, development of VR-based surgical simulator takes much effort not only for implementing simulation modules but also for setting surgical environment and choosing simulation modules. Surgical manual describes knowledge of manipulations in surgical procedure. In this study, language processing is used to extract anatomical objects and surgical manipulations in a scene from surgical manual. In addition, benchmark and LOD control of simulation modules optimize the simulation. We propose a framework of semiautomatic development of optimized simulator with surgical manuals. In the framework, SVM based machine learning is adapted in extracting surgical information and XML file was made. Simulation programs were crated from XML file using a simulation library in different system configurations.

While this task is often considered as unsophisticated clerical work, in the life sciences domain it poses enormous problems due to complex naming conventions. In this paper, we first introduce an annotation framework for sentence and token splitting underlying a newly constructed sentence- and token-tagged biomedical text corpus. This corpus serves as a training environment and test bed for machine-learning based sentence and token splitters using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Our evaluation experiments reveal that CRFs with a rich feature set substantially increase sentence and token detection performance.

These models are traditionally built with supervised machine learning techniques, and consider prognosis as a static, one-shot activity. This paper presents a new type of prognostic model that builds on the Bayesian network methodology that implements a dynamic, process-oriented view on prognosis. In contrast to traditional prognostic models, prognostic Bayesian networks explicate the scenarios that lead to disease outcomes, and can be used to update predictions whet? new information becomes available. A recursive data analysis strategy for inducing prognostic Bayesian networks from medical data is presented, and applied to data from the field of cardiac surgery. The resulting model outperformed a model that was constructed with off-the-shelf Bayesian network learning software, and had similar performance as class probability trees.

Syndromic approach to management of STDs is based on the identification of a consistent group of symptoms and syndromes to classify, the exact disease or infection beforehand, so that further investigations are sought for based on these initial criteria. This paper envisions the results based oil two different approaches: Human and Artificial Intelligence (AI) along with some examples of on-going usage e of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine. Pakistan is in an early stage regarding the use of informatics in health care for sustainable health system but is also under international obligation to adopt it & WHO EMRO has developed an e-Health plan for the member countries including Pakistan. The paper presents all informatics application model for a very common but important problem & development of such e-health applications, as starting point, will certainly have positive impact the future of development of e-Health in Pakistan.

Learning effective and efficient prediction models from such data sets is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines Metaheuristic search and Bayesian Networks to learn a graphical Markov Blanket-based classifier from data. The Tabu Search enhanced Markov Blanket (TS/MB) procedure is based on the use of restricted neighborhoods in a general Bayesian Network constrained by the Markov condition, called Markov Blanket Neighborhoods. Computational results from two real world healthcare data sets indicate that the TS/MB procedure converges fast and is able to find a parsimonious model with substantially fewer predictor variables than in the full data set. Furthermore, it has comparable or better prediction performance when compared against several machine learning methods, and provides insight into possible causal relations among the variables.

A Scale-Free Network View of the UMLS to Learn Terminology Translations	MEDINFO 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH WORLD CONGRESS ON HEALTH (MEDICAL) INFORMATICS, PTS 1 AND 2	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	12th World Congress on Health (Medical) Informatics	AUG 20-24, 2007	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Hlth Informat Soc Australia		UMLS; scale-free networks; terminology; mapping; machine learning		The UMLS Metathesaurus belongs to the class of scale-free networks with few concept hubs possessing a large number of relationships. The hubs provide useful links between the concepts from disparate terminologies in the UMLS: however, they also exponentially increase the number of possible transitive cross-terminology paths. Towards the goal of using machine learning to rank cross-terminology translations, we propose a traversal algorithm that exploits the scale-free property of the UMLS to reduce the number of candidate translations. We characterize the concept hubs into "informational" and "noisy" concept hubs and provide an automated method to detect them. Using gold standard mappings from SNOMED-CT to ICD9CM, we found an average 20-fold reduction in the number of candidate mappings while achieving comparable recall and ranking results. A hub-driven traversal strategy provides a promising approach to generate high quality cross-terminology translations from the UMLS.

Owing to the open nature of the Web, the reliability of information available on the Web is uneven. Internet users are overwhelmed by the quantity of information available on the Web. The situation is even more critical in the medical area, as the content proposed by health websites can have a direct impact on the users' well being. One way to control the reliability of health websites is to assess their quality and to make this assessment available to users. The HON Foundation has defined a set of eight ethical principles. HON. experts are working in order to manually define whether a given website complies with s the required principles. As the number of medical websites is constantly growing, manual expertise becomes insufficient and automatic systems should be used in order to help medical experts. In this paper we present the design and the evaluation of an automatic system conceived for the categorisation of medical and health documents according to he HONcode ethical principles. A first evaluation shows promising results. Currently the system shows 0.78 micro precision and 0.73 F-measure, with 0.06 errors.

Automatic assignment of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), which is formally an automatic text categorization task, has been proposed using different methods or combination of methods, including machine learning (naive Bayes, neural networks ...), linguistically-motivated methods (syntactic parsing, semantic tagging, or information retrieval. METHODS: In the present study, we propose to evaluate the impact of the argumentative structures of scientific articles to improve the categorization effectiveness of a categorizer, which combines linguistically-motivated and information retrieval methods. Our argumentative categorizer which uses representation levels inherited from the field of discourse analysis, is able to classify sentences of an abstract in four classes: PURPOSE; METHODS,RESULTS and CONCLUSION. For the evaluation, the OHSUMED collection, a sample of MEDLINE, is used as a benchmark. For each abstract in the collection, the result of the argumentative classifier, i.e. the labeling of each sentence with an argumentative class, is used to modify the original ranking of the MeSH categorizer RESULTS: The most effective combination (+2%, p<0.003) strongly over-weights the METHODS section and moderately the RESULTS and CONCLUSION section. CONCLUSION: Although modest, the improvement brought by argumentative features for text categorization confirms that discourse analysis methods could benefit text mining in scientific digital libraries.

A Comparison of Impact Factor, Clinical Query Filters, and Pattern Recognition Query Filters in Terms of Sensitivity to Topic	MEDINFO 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH WORLD CONGRESS ON HEALTH (MEDICAL) INFORMATICS, PTS 1 AND 2	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics		English	Proceedings Paper	12th World Congress on Health (Medical) Informatics	AUG 20-24, 2007	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Hlth Informat Soc Australia			MEDLINE	Evaluating journal quality and finding high-quality articles in the biomedical literature are challenging information retrieval tasks. The most widely used method for journal evaluation is impact factor, while novel approaches for finding articles are PubMed's clinical query filters and machine learning-based filter models. The related literature has focused on the average behavior of these methods over all topics. The present study evaluates the variability of these approaches for different topics. We find that impact factor and clinical query filters are unstable for different topics while a topic-specific impact factor and machine learning-based filter models appear more robust. Thus when using the less stable methods for a specific topic, researchers should realize that their performance may diverge from expected average performance. Better yet, the more stable methods should be preferred whenever applicable.

Population: All patients 2-18 years of age presenting to a pediatric emergency department during a 2-month study period. Methods: We created an artificial neural network, a support vector machine, a Gaussian process, and a learned Bayesian network to compare each methods ability to detect patients eligible for asthma guidelines. Our outcome measures included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. Results: The data were randomly split into a training set (n=3017) and test set (n=1006) for analysis. The systems performed equally well. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.959 for the expert-built Bayesian network, 0.962 for the automatically constructed Bayesian network, 0.956 for the Gaussian Process, and 0.937 for the artificial neural network. Discussion: All four evaluated machine learning methods achieved high accuracy. The automatically created Bayesian network performed similarly to the expert-built network. These methods could be applied to create a real-time detection system for identifying asthma patients.

Patients with conditions that are not currently fully treatable are particularly susceptible to unproven and dangerous promises about miracle treatments. In extreme cases, fatal adverse outcomes have been documented Most commonly, the cost is financial, psychological, and delayed application of imperfect but proven scientific modalities. To help protect patients, who may be desperately ill and thus prone to exploitation, we explored the use of machine learning techniques to identify web pages that make unproven claims. This feasibility study shows that the resulting models can identify web pages that make unproven claims in a fully automatic manner, and substantially better than previous web tools and state-of-the-art search engine technology.

Finding cost-effective methods to predict CAD is a major challenge in public health. In this paper we investigate the combined effects of genetic polymorphisms and non-genetic factors on predicting the risk of CAD by applying well known classification methods, such as Bayesian networks, naive Bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor neural networks and decision trees. Our experiments show that all these classifiers are comparable in terms of accuracy, while Bayesian networks have the additional advantage of being able to provide insights into the relationships among the variables. We observe that the learned Bayesian Network identify manY important dependency relationships among genetic variables, which can be verified with domain knowledge. Conforming to current domain understanding, our results indicate that related diseases (e.g., diabetes and hypertension), age and smoking status are the most important factors for CAD prediction, while the genetic polymorphisms entail more complicated influences.

The sparsity of samples makes it difficult for machine learning techniques to discover probes relevant to the classification of tumor tissue. By combining data from different platforms (i.e., data sources), data sparsity is reduced, but this typically requires normalizing data from the different platforms, which can be non-trivial. This paper proposes a variant on the idea of ensemble learners to circumvent the need for normalization. To facilitate comprehension we build ensembles of very, simple classifiers known as decision stumps - decision trees of one test each. The Ensemble Stump Classifier (ESC) identifies an mRNA signature having three probes and high accuracy for distinguishing between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung across four data sets. In terms of accuracy, ESC outperforms a decision free classifier on all four data sets, outperforms ensemble decision trees on three data sets, and simple stump classifiers on two data sets.

Its interpretation is subjective, dependent upon the expertise and experience of the clinical scientist. It? this study we investigated the role of machine learning for pattern classification in this domain. We extracted features from the ABRs of 85 test subjects (550 waveforms) and compared four complimentary supervised classification methods: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Multi-Layer Perceptron and KStar The ABR dataset comprised both high level and near threshold recordings, labeled as 'response' or 'no response' by the human expert. Features were extracted from single averaged recordings to make the classification process straightforward. A best classification accuracy of 83.4% was obtained using Naive Bayes and five relevant features extracted from time and wavelet domains. Naive Bayes also achieved the highest specificity (863%). The highest sensitivity (93.1%) was obtained with Support Vector Machine-based classification models. In terms of the overall classification accuracy, four classifiers have shown the consistent, relatively high performance, indicating the relevance of selected features and the feasibility of using machine learning and statistical classification models in the analysis of ABR.

The growing amount of stored documents increases the need for effective and timely retrieval of information. We developed a multi-label text classification system to categorize free text medical documents (e.g. discharge letters, clinical findings, reports) written in German into predefined classes. A random sample of 1,500 free text medical documents Was retrieved from a general hospital information system and was manually assigned to I to 8 categories by a domain expert. This sample was used to train and evaluate the performance of 4 classification schemes: Naive Bayes, k-NN, SVM, and J48. Additional tests of the effect of text preprocessing were done. In our study, preprocessing improved the performance, and best results were obtained by J48 classification.

Perceptionally similar music files are represented in the same cluster. A human user was asked to rate music files according to their subjective similarity. Compared to the user's judgment, the system had a mean accuracy of 65.7%. The accuracy of the framework increases with the size of the music corpus to a maximum of 75%. The study at hand shows that it is possible to categorize music files into similarity clusters by taking solely mathematical features into account that have been extracted from the files themselves. This allows for a variety of different applications like lowering the search space in manual music comparison, or content-based music recommendation.

Weighted instance-based learning using representative intervals	MICAI 2007: ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	6th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (MICAI 2007)	NOV 04-10, 2007	Aguascalientes, MEXICO	Mexican Soc Artificial Intelligence		feature weighting; instance-based learning; K-NN	ALGORITHMS	Instance-based learning algorithms are widely used due to their capacity to approximate complex target functions; however; the performance of this kind of algorithms degrades significantly in the presence of irrelevant features. This paper introduces a new noise tolerant instance-based learning algorithm, called WIB-K, that uses one or more weights, per feature per class, to classify integer-valued databases. A set of intervals that represent the rank of values of all the features is automatically created for each class, and the nonrepresentative intervals are discarded. The remaining intervals (representative intervals) of each feature are compared against the representative intervals of the same feature in the other classes to assign a weight. The weight represents the discriminative power of the interval, and is used in the similarity function to improve the classification accuracy. The algorithm was tested on several datasets, and compared against other representative machine learning algorithms showing very competitive results.

In fact, there is still a lack of systems that solve efficiently this kind of problem. At present, we find two different approaches: knowledge systems and machine learning systems. Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning systems obtain better results than knowledge systems but there is a problem: the lack of annotated contexts and corpus to train the systems. In this work, we try to avoid this situation by combining a new machine learning system with a knowledge based system.

Microarchitectural design space exploration using an architecture-centric approach	MICRO-40: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 40TH ANNUAL IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MICROARCHITECTURE	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MICROARCHITECTURE, PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	40th Annual IEEE/AMC International Symposium on Microarchitecture	DEC 01-05, 2007	Chicago, IL	IEEE, ACM				The microarchitectural design space of a new processor is too large for an architect to evaluate in its entirely. Even with the use of statistical simulation, evaluation of a single configuration can take excessive time due to the need to run a set of benchmarks with realistic workloads. This paper proposes a novel machine learning model that can quickly and accurately predict the performance and energy consumption of any set of programs on any microarchitectural configuration. This architecture-centric approach uses prior knowledge from off-line training and applies it across benchmarks. This allows our model to predict the performance of any new program across the entire microarchitecture configuration space with just 32 further simulations. We compare our approach to a state-of-the-art program-specific predictor and show that we significantly reduce prediction error We reduce the average error when predicting performance from 24% to just 7% and increase the correlation coefficient from 0.55 to 0.95. We then show that this predictor can be used to guide the search of the design space, selecting the best configuration for energy-delay in just 3 further simulations, reducing it to 0.85. We also evaluate the cost of off-line learning and show that we can still achieve a high level of accuracy when using just 5 benchmarks to train. Finally, we analyse our design space and show how different microarchitectural parameters can affect the cycles, energy and energy-delay of the architectural configurations.

Current estimates suggest the number of miRNA genes may be twice of what is currently known, and the mechanisms governing miRNA targeting remain elusive. Machine learning algorithms can be used to create classifiers that capture the characteristics of verified examples to determine whether genomic hairpins are similar to verified miRNA genes or if message 3'UTRs possess known target characteristics. Algorithms can never replace biological verifications, but should always be used to guide experimental design.

The detection system consists of two stages. In the first stage, edge and corner information is obtained by edge detector and corner detector. By setting range for the number of edge pixel and corner in the scanning window, a large number of non-object windows are rejected. In the second stage, the classifier trained by 2DCCA is combined with slide window method so that further non-object windows are rejected. For the case that one object is simultaneously contained in several windows, the algorithm of determining the best position of object is designed. Compared with related approaches, our method has advantage of obtaining higher precision under the similar recall. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by experimental results.

Steganography anomaly detection using simple one-class classification - art. no. 65790E	Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing for Military and Security Applications 2007	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Mobile Multimedia/Image Processing for Military and Security Applications	APR 11-12, 2007	Orlando, FL	SPIE		classification; steganography; steganalysis; anomaly detection		There are several security issues tied to multimedia when implementing the various applications in the cellular phone and wireless industry. One primary concern is the potential ease of implementing a steganography system. Traditionally, the only mechanism to embed information into a media file has been with a desktop computer. However, as the cellular phone and wireless industry matures, it becomes much simpler for the same techniques to be performed using a cell phone. In this paper, two methods are compared that classify cell phone images as either an anomaly or clean, where a clean image is one in which no alterations have been made and an anomalous image is one in which information has been hidden within the image. An image in which information has been hidden is known as a stego image. The main concern in detecting steganographic content with machine learning using cell phone images is in training specific embedding procedures to determine if the method has been used to generate a stego image. This leads to a possible flaw in the system when the learned model of stego is faced with a new stego method which doesn't match the existing model. The proposed solution to this problem is to develop systems that detect steganography as anomalies, making the embedding method irrelevant in detection. Two applicable classification methods for solving the anomaly detection of steganographic content problem are single class support vector machines (SVM) and Parzen-window. Empirical comparison of the two approaches shows that Parzen-window outperforms the single class SVM most likely due to the fact that Parzen-window generalizes less.

Context Browsing with Mobiles - When Less is More	MOBISYS '07: PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications and Services	JUN 11-14, 2007	San Juan, PR	ACM SIGMOBILE, USENIX, HP Res, IBM, intel, Microsoft Res, Natl Sci Fdn, Nokia		Context-Directed Browsing; CMo; Partitioning; Semantic Blocks; PDA; Mobile Browsing; Content Adaptation		Except for a handful of "mobile" Web sites, the Web is designed for browsing using personal computers with large screens capable of fully rendering the content of most Web pages. Browsing with handhelds, such as small-screen PDA's or cell phones, usually involves a lot of horizontal and vertical scrolling, thus making Web browsing time-consuming and strenuous. At the same time, one is often only interested in a fragment of a Web page, which again may not fit on the limited-size screens of mobile devices, requiring more scrolling in both dimensions. In this paper, we address the problem of browsing fatigue during mobile Web access using geometric segmentation of Web pages and the notion of context. Our prototype system, CMo, reduces information overload by allowing its users to see the most relevant fragment of the page and then navigate between other fragments if necessary. On following a link, CMo captures the context of the link, employing a simple topic-boundary detection technique; then, it uses the context to identify relevant information in the next page with the help of a Support Vector Machine, a statistical machine-learning model. Our experiments show that the use of context can potentially save browsing time and improve the mobile browsing experience.	[Borodin, Yevgen; Mahmud, Jalal; Ramakrishnan, I.

We focus on this new approach of in-place and in-time e-learning, which offers learning resources right in time the user is in need for it. A crucial factor for those modern task-oriented e-learning software is the user's context. To deliver learning resources to the user, which are both suitable and helpful with regards to the user's current work situation and his competencies, the application always has to consider the learner's actual work task, his environment, and history. In this paper, we present an architecture for the work task prediction, evaluate different machine learning algorithms in depth by their accuracy for that purpose and discuss the integration in our e-learning environment. This validates the possible usage in real-world business scenarios.

In order to handle data with numerical values, we have defined numerical patterns with two symbols # and @, and have proposed more flexible rough sets based rule generation. The concepts of 'coarse' and 'fine' for rules are explicitly defined according to numerical patterns. This paper focuses on the rough sets based method for rule generation, which is enhanced by numerical patterns, and refers to the tool programs. Tool programs are applied to data in UCI Machine Learning Repository, and some useful rules are obtained.

Pluralistic Modelling Approaches to Simulating Climate-Land Change Interactions in East Africa	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Land use; climate change; expert systems; role playing games; qualitative models; East Africa		We summarize the use of several different modelling approaches we are employing to understand how climate change impacts changes in land use in East Africa. A role playing game model has been employed that helps to elucidate the behavioural drivers of land use change and how these factors are integrated with other biophysical (e. g. climate) and socioeconomic drivers. Outcomes from the game include a qualitative list and integrative understanding of these drivers over spatial and temporal scales and a series of decision maps produced by game participants. A second method includes the use of expert systems or knowledge acquisition approaches that attempt to synthesize expert opinion on how societies may adapt to changes in climate. Outcomes of these knowledge acquisition activities include expert maps and systems diagrams both of which are used to construct and validate models. These two qualitative approaches were used to construct three different sets of models: those that use multi-criteria evaluation techniques integrating a variety of spatial data layers using a geographic information system; a machine learning based model employing artificial neural networks that learn from patterns in data, and a behavioural model using Bayesian Belief Networks that simulates individual behaviour in the context of social interactions. We show how these diverse methods are used together to aid in our understanding of the drivers and impacts of climate change on land use systems in East Africa. In particular, we are interested in the impacts climate change might have on pastoralist, cropping, and urban systems over the next 10-50 years. These methods are being used along with process based models of regional climate change and crop production models to understand the coupling of climate and land systems in this geographically diverse area of the world. In our discussion we compare and contrast these very different, but complementary, modelling approaches to understand climate change at local to regional scales.	[Pijanowski, B.

The prediction of properties is correlated with chemical structure, type and copolymer composition, molecular weight, and a series of structural characteristics estimated by mechanical molecular simulation. The importance of a suitable choice for the parameters that characterize the structure and the behavior of the copolyethers is emphasized, as well as the codification of the input and output variables of the algorithms. The procedures are simple and provide accurate results, especially neural-network-based techniques.

In silico prediction of pregnane X receptor activators by machine learning approaches	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MOLECULAR DESCRIPTORS; XENOBIOTIC RECEPTOR; NUCLEAR RECEPTORS; DRUG-INTERACTIONS; PXR; SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; PHARMACOPHORE	Pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulates drug metabolism and is involved in drug-drug interactions. Prediction of PXR activators is important for evaluating drug metabolism and toxicity. Computational pharmacophore and quantitative structure-activity relationship models have been developed for predicting PXR activators. Because of the structural diversity of PXR activators, more efforts are needed for exploring methods applicable to a broader spectrum of compounds. We explored three machine learning methods (MLMs) for predicting PXR activators, which were trained and tested by using significantly higher number of compounds, 128 PXR activators (98 human) and 77 PXR nonactivators, than those of previous studies. The recursive feature-selection method was used to select molecular descriptors relevant to PXR activator prediction, which are consistent with conclusions from other computational and structural studies. In a 10-fold cross-validation test, our MLM systems correctly predicted 81.2 to 84.0% of PXR activators, 80.8 to 85.0% of hPXR activators, 61.2 to 70.3% of PXR nonactivators, and 67.7 to 73.6% of hPXR nonactivators. Our systems also correctly predicted 73.3 to 86.7% of 15 newly published hPXR activators. MLMs seem to be useful for predicting PXR activators and for providing clues to physicochemical features of PXR activation.

Current strategies often lack real network infrastructure detection and responses for distinguishing between benign traffic and complex attacks. This intelligent hybrid detection and response strategies distinguishes between real attack and normal traffic. This novel strategy consists of a hybrid statistical analysis involving Ward's hierarchical clustering. This results of the hybrid statistical analysis is fed back to the IDS' alert monitor to identify real attacks and isolate benign traffic. This intelligent detection and response strategy enhances the ability of the IDS to accurately detect and respond to subsequent threats and benign traffic in critical segments of real network infrastructures.

The core of the problem is that the standing general theories cannot even explain why people comply as much as they do, much less make predictions or support prescriptions for the public entities. The compliance decision is a challenge posed to rational choice theory, and one that defies the current choice mechanisms in multi-agent systems. The key idea of this project is that by considering rationally-heterogeneous agents immersed in a highly social environment we can get hold of a better grasp of what is really involved in the individual decisions. Moreover, we aim at understanding how those decisions determine tendencies for the behaviour of the whole society, and how in turn those tendencies influence individual behaviour. This paper presents the results of some exploratory simulations carried out to uncover regularities, correlations and trends in the models that represent first and then expand the standard theories on the field. We conclude that forces like social imitation and local neighbourhood enforcement and reputation are far more important than individual perception of expected utility maximising, in what respects compliance decisions.

The real problem of bridging the "Semantic gap"	Multimedia Content Analysis and Mining, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Multimedia Content Analysis and Mining	JUN 30-JUL 01, 2007	Weihai, PEOPLES R CHINA					The "semantic gap" is a well-know problem in multimedia. The challenge is to accurately classify and effectively search multimedia content from automatically extracted low-level audio-visual features. While much effort is focused on developing the best machine learning approaches, not enough attention is placed on the required semantic coverage and the real utility of the classifiers in multimedia systems. Exacerbating the problem is the tremendous dearth of reliable training data across the diversity of semantics required for effective multimedia search in practice. Until we address the problems of what classifiers are needed in the large scale and how they can be sufficiently trained, research on bridging the "semantic gap" will not produce any real impact.

Although traditional machine learning approaches just extract fragmentary information of images, their performance is still not satisfying. In this paper, we propose a novel system that automatically extracts high-level concepts such as spatial relationships or natural-enemy relationships from images using combination of ontologies and SVM classifiers. Our system consists of two phases. In the first phase, visual features are mapped to intermediate-level concepts (e.g, yellow, 45 angular stripes). And then, a set of these concepts are classified into relevant object concepts (e.g, tiger) by using SVM-classifiers. In this phase, revision module which improves the accuracy of classification is used. In the second phase, based on extracted visual information and domain ontology, we deduce semantic relationships such as spatial/natural-enemy relationships between multiple objects in an image. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system using color images including about 20 object concepts.

In this paper, subspace ensembles for classification are explored which constitute an ensemble classifier system by manipulating different feature subspaces. Starting with the nature of ensemble efficacy, we probe into the microcosmic meaning of ensemble diversity, and propose to use region partitioning and region weighting to implement effective subspace ensembles. An improved random subspace method that integrates this mechanism is presented. Individual classifiers possessing eminent performance on a partitioned region reflected by high neighborhood accuracies, are deemed to contribute largely to this region, and are assigned large weights in determining the labels of instances in this area. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown empirically with the base classifier of linear support vector machines on the classification problem of EEG signals.

This technique can be directly used for the selection of an ensemble in a pool of classifiers. We also propose a variant of AdaBoost for directly training the classifiers by taking into account this new information theoretic measure.

The weights are based on image features and represent the a. nity between di. erent pixels in the image. By prescribing di. erent formulas for the weights, one can generalize many local and nonlocal linear denoising algorithms, including the nonlocal means. lter and the bilateral. lter. In this framework one can easily show that continuous iterations of the generalized. lter obey certain global characteristics and converge to a constant solution. The linear operator associated with the Euler-Lagrange equation of the functional is closely related to the graph Laplacian. We can thus interpret the steepest descent for minimizing the functional as a nonlocal di. usion process. This formulation allows a convenient framework for nonlocal variational minimizations, including variational denoising, Bregman iterations, and the recently proposed inverse scale space. It is also demonstrated how the steepest descent. ow can be used for segmentation. Following kernel based methods in machine learning, the generalized di. usion process is used to propagate sporadic initial user's information to the entire image. Unlike classical variational segmentation methods, the process is not explicitly based on a curve length energy and thus can cope well with highly nonconvex shapes and corners. Reasonable robustness to noise is still achieved.

An attempt is made to satisfy these requirements using fuzzy set driven information visualization technique; and movie as the item and genre as the feature are used for illustration. Visualization of features of items, patterns of customer previous feedback to these items, and the relationship between the feedback and item features along with associated measure of uncertainty are presented. The uncertainty is non-stochastic type that is induced from subjectivity, vagueness and imprecision in item features and user preference; and it is modeled using fuzzy set. The visualization of the discovered preference along various demographic features of the users is also presented. This in turn can help forming clusters of users with similar preference to various kinds of items.

A novel granular neural network architecture	NAFIPS 2007 - 2007 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society	JUN 24-27, 2007	San Diego, CA	N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc, IEEE		granular computing; neuro-fuzzy systems; machine learning; granular neural networks	CLASSIFICATION	We introduce a novel granular neural network (GNN) architecture based on the multi-layer perceptron architecture. The GNN uses linguistic terms as connection weights, and uses the operations of linguistic arithmetic to update those connection weights. The GNN has been implemented in a Java-based simulation environment, with support for both regression and classification learning tasks. We present the results of a preliminary experimental comparison between the GNN and the c4.5 decision tree algorithm on two benchmark datasets. Our results show that the GNN was slightly more accurate than c4.5 on both datasets.

We study the software defect prediction problem, which focuses on predicting which modules will experience a failure during operation. Numerous studies have applied machine learning to software defect prediction; however, skewness in defect-prediction datasets usually undermines the learning algorithms. The resulting classifiers will often never predict the faulty (minority0 class. This problem is well known in machine learning and is often referred to as learning from imbalanced datasets. We examine stratification, a widely used technique for learning imbalanced data that has received little attention in software defect prediction. Our experiments are focused on the SMOTE technique, which is a method of over-sampling minority-class examples. Our goat is to determine if SMOTE can improve recognition of defect-prone modules, and at what cost. Our experiments demonstrate that after SMOTE resampling, we have a more balanced classification. We found an improvement of at least 23% in the average geometric mean classification accuracy on four benchmark datasets.

Towards inductive learning of complex fuzzy inference systems	NAFIPS 2007 - 2007 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society	JUN 24-27, 2007	San Diego, CA	N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc, IEEE		complex fuzzy logic; complex fuzzy sets; neuro-fuzzy systems; machine learning	LOGIC; SETS	Complex fuzzy logic is an extension to type-1 fuzzy sets that has recently been developed. To date, no practical applications of complex fuzzy logic have been developed, possibly due to the difficulty of eliciting expert knowledge for both the magnitude and phase of a complex fuzzy set We believe that practical applications of complex fuzzy logic require inductive learning. We are taking a first step towards this by building an inductive learning algorithm ANCFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Complex Inference System), which hybridizes the theory of complex fuzzy inference and ANFIS. We believe that complex fuzzy sets will be a remarkably efficient way of modeling approximately periodic data. Thus, our proposed application of ANCFIS is in time series forecasting. We present an introduction to ANCFIS, its structure and computational formulas. The ANCFIS architecture is tested against three commonly cited time series datasets. Preliminary results show that ANCFIS is indeed able to model relatively periodic data as expected.

The results indicate that the novel algorithms perform better than the existing algorithms.

The outputs of such analyses can provide useful information to guide the activities aimed at preventing, detecting, and responding to security problems. In this chapter, we survey recent developments in an important class of spatio-temporal data analysis task focusing on Clustering or hotspot analysis. Both statistical and machine learning-based analysis techniques are discussed in offline (retrospective) and online (prospective) data analysis contexts. Computational studies carried out to evaluate the strengths and limitations of these techniques are reported. To illustrate how such techniques can be used in real-world applications, we also summarize two case studies using real datasets.

This paper describes four novel supervised disambiguation methods which adapt some familiar algorithms. They built on the Vector Space Model using an automatically generated stop list and two different statistical methods of finding index terms. These proceedings allow a fully automated and language independent disambiguation. The first method is based upon Latent Semantic Analysis, an automatic indexing method employed for text retrieval. The second one disambiguates via co-occurrence vectors of the target word. Disambiguation relying on Naive Bayes uses the Naive Bayes Classifier and disambiguation relying on SenseClusters(1) uses an unsupervised word sense discrimination technique. These methods were implemented and evaluated to experience their performance, to compare the different approaches and to draw conclusions about the main characteristic of supervised disambiguation. The results show that the classification approach using Naive Bayes is the most efficient, scalable and successful method.

Supervised learning algorithms based on support vector machines are currently one of the most effective methods in machine learning. A support vector approach is used in this paper(1) to solve a typical problem in image registration, this is, the joint probability density function estimation needed in the image registration by maximization of mutual information. Results estimating the joint probability density function for two CT and PET images demonstrate the proposed approach advantages over the classical histogram estimation.

Determining the optimum number of threads for a given data parallel loop, for example, is a difficult problem and dependent on the specific parallel platform. This paper presents a learning-based approach to parallel workload allocation in a cost-aware manner. This approach uses static program features to classify programs, before deciding the best workload allocation scheme based on its prior experience with similar programs. Experimental results on 12 Java benchmarks (76 test cases with different workloads in total) show that it can efficiently allocate the parallel workload among Java threads and achieve an efficiency of 86% on average.

J	Zhong, P; Fukushima, M				Zhong, Ping; Fukushima, Masao			Second-order cone programming formulations for robust multiclass classification	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Multiclass classification is an important and ongoing research subject in machine learning. Current support vector methods for multiclass classification implicitly assume that the parameters in the optimization problems are known exactly. However, in practice, the parameters have perturbations since they are estimated from the training data, which are usually subject to measurement noise. In this article, we propose linear and nonlinear robust formulations for multiclass classification based on the M-SVM method. The preliminary numerical experiments confirm the robustness of the proposed method.

Recommender systems aim at delivering and suggesting relevant information according to users preferences, thus EPSSs could take advantage of the recommendation algorithms that have the effect of guiding users in a large space of possible options. The JUMP project(1) aims at integrating an EPSS with a hybrid recommender system. Collaborative and content-based filtering are the recommendation techniques most widely adopted to date. The main contribution of this paper is a content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. A distinctive feature of our system is that a statistical model of the user interests is obtained by machine learning techniques integrated with linguistic knowledge contained in WordNet. This model, named "semantic user profile", is exploited by the hybrid recommender in the neighborhood formation process.

On the road to genetic Boolean matrix factorization	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						data mining; genetics algorithms; Boolean factorization; binary data; machine learning; feature extraction	BARS PROBLEM	Matrix factorization or factor analysis is an important task helpful in the analysis of high dimensional real world data. There are several well known methods and algorithms for factorization of real data but many application areas including information retrieval, pattern recognition and data mining require processing of binary rather than real data. Unfortunately, the methods used for real matrix factorization fail in the latter case. In this paper we introduce background and initial version of Genetic Algorithm for binary matrix factorization.

However, the time that Fuzzy ARTMAP takes to converge to a solution increases rapidly as the number of patterns used for training is increased. In this paper we examine the time Fuzzy ARTMAP takes to converge to a solution and we propose a coarse grain parallelization technique, based on a pipeline approach, to speed-up the training process. In particular, we have parallelized Fuzzy ARTMAP without the match-tracking mechanism. We provide a series of theorems and associated proofs that show the characteristics of Fuzzy ARTMAP's, without matchtracking, parallel implementation. Results run on a BEOWULF cluster with three large databases show linear speedup as a function of the number of processors used in the pipeline.

Symmetrical principal component analysis (SPCA) is an excellent feature extraction method for face classification because it utilizes the symmetry of the facial images. This paper presents one Kernel based SPCA (KSPCA) algorithm which gives the closed form for polynomial kernel. KSPCA combines advantages of SPCA with kernel method, i.e., KSPCA not only makes use of the symmetry of the facial images, but also extracts nonlinear principal components which contain more abundant information. We compare the performance of SPCA, kernel PCA (KPCA) with KSPCA on CBCL database for binary classification, and on ORL and Yale face database for multi-category classification, respectively. The experimental results show that KSPCA outperforms both SPCA and KPCA. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intuitively the accuracy in forecasting the direction and magnitude of future exchange rate movements is central to currency risk management decision-making process. This research investigates the predictive performance of a hybrid multivariate model, using multiple macroeconomic and microstructure of foreign exchange market variables. Conceptually, the proposed system combines and exploits the merit of adaptive learning artificial neural network (ANN) and intuitive reasoning (fuzzy-logic inference) tools. An ANN is employed to forecast a foreign exchange rate movement which is followed by the intuitive reasoning of multi-period foreign currency returns using multi-value fuzzy logic for foreign currency risk management decision-making. Empirical tests with statistical and machine learning criteria reveal plausible performance of its predictive capability. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method consists of two steps. In the first step, each FMRI-IC is associated with an IC-fingerprint, i.e., a representation of the component in a multidimensional space of parameters. These parameters are post hoc estimates of global properties of the ICs and are largely independent of a specific experimental design and stimulus timing. In the second step a machine learning algorithm automatically separates the IC-fingerprints into six general classes after preliminary training performed on a small subset of expert-labeled components. We illustrate this approach in a multisubject fMRI study employing visual structure-from-motion stimuli encoding faces and control random shapes. We show that: (1) IC-fingerprints are a valuable tool for the inspection, characterization and selection of fMRI-ICs and (2) automatic classifications of FMRI-ICs in new subjects present a high correspondence with those obtained by expert visual inspection of the components. Importantly, our classification procedure highlights several neuro-physiologically interesting processes. The most intriguing of which is reflected, with high intra- and inter-subject reproducibility, in one IC exhibiting a transiently task-related activation in the 'face' region of the primary sensorimotor cortex. This suggests that in addition to or as part of the mirror system, somatotopic regions of the sensorimotor cortex are involved in disambiguating the perception of a moving body part. Finally, we show that the same classification algorithm can be successfully applied, without re-training, to fMRI collected using acquisition parameters, stimulation modality and timing considerably different from those used for training.

Trust evaluation is achieved by means of both behavioral evaluation and credentials exchange, in such way that transitions among different access policies are automatically fired whenever a user behavior is validated. Behavioral analysis uses machine-learning techniques to gain knowledge about users navigation tracks, creating a user signature to be compared with a current behavior of the respective user. This mechanism is validated through experimental evaluation.

In general risk management, inductive management is usually adopted. If we computationally conduct inductive management, it is vital to collect a considerable number of examples to perform machine learning. For nursing risk management, risk management experts usually perform manual learning to produce textbooks. In the Accident or Incident Report Database home page, we can review various types of accidents or incidents. However, since reports are written by various nurses, the granularity and quality of reports are not sufficient for machine learning. We, therefore, explain the importance of conducting dynamic nursing risk management that can be achieved by abduction, then illustrate cooperation between abductive and inductive types of nursing risk management.

It is very efficient because of its greedy search. We have expanded GBI to construct a decision tree that can handle graph-structured data. DT-GBI constructs a decision tree while simultaneously constructing attributes for classification using GBI. In DT-GBI attributes, namely substructures useful for classification task, are constructed by GBI on the fly during the tree construction. We applied both GBI and DT-GBI to classification tasks of a real world hepatitis data. Three classification problems were solved in five experiments. In the first 4 experiments, DT-GBI was applied to build decision trees to classify 1) cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis (Experiments 1 and 2), 2) type C and type B (Experiment 3), and 3) positive and negative responses of interferon therapy (Experiment 4). As the patterns extracted in these experiments are thought discriminative, in the last experiment (Experiment 5) GBI was applied to extract descriptive patterns for interferon therapy. The preliminary results of experiments, both constructed decision trees and their predictive accuracies as well as extracted patterns, are reported in this paper. Some of the patterns match domain experts' experience and the overall results are encouraging.

By using the principle of learning by imitation, the robot can instead be taught simply by showing it what to do. This paper investigates the self-organization of a connectionist modular architecture for motor learning and control that is used to imitate human dancing. We have observed that the internal representation of a motion behaviour tends to be captured by more than one module. This supports the hypothesis that a modular architecture for motor learning is capable of self-organizing the decomposition of a movement.

Recently, we introduced a new class of classifiers ICF, which is based on iteratively composed features on {0, 1, *}-valued data sets. We proposed an algorithm ALG-ICF* to construct an ICF classifier and showed its high performance. In this paper, we extend ICF so that it can also process real world data sets consisting of numerical and/or categorical attributes. For this purpose, we incorporate a discretization scheme into ALG-ICF* as its preprocessor, by which an input real world data set is transformed into {0, 1, *}-valued one. Based on the experimental studies on conventional discretization schemes, we propose a new discretization scheme, integrated construction (IC). Our computational experiments reveal that the ALG-ICF* equipped with IC outperforms a decision tree constructor C4.5 in many cases.

Prediction of minimum temperatures in an alpine region by linear and non-linear post-processing of meteorological models	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; BOUNDARY-LAYER; KALMAN FILTER; FORECASTS; ALGORITHMS; PROTECTION; REGRESSION	Model Output Statistics (MOS) refers to a method of post-processing the direct outputs of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in order to reduce the biases introduced by a coarse horizontal resolution. This technique is especially useful in orographically complex regions. where large differences can be found between the NWP elevation model and the true orography. This study carries out a comparison of linear and non-linear MOS methods, aimed at the prediction of minimum temperatures in a fruit-growing region of the Italian Alps. based on the output of two different NWPs (ECMWF T511-L60 and LAMI-3). Temperature. of course, is a particularly important NWP output;, among, other roles it drives the local frost forecast, which is of great interest to agriculture. The mechanisms of cold air drainage. a distinctive aspect of mountain environments, are often unsatisfactorily captured by global circulation models. The simplest post-processing technique applied in this work was a correction for the mean bias, assessed at individual model grid points. We also implemented a multivariate linear regression on the output at the grid points surrounding the target area, and two non-linear models based on machine learning techniques: Neural Networks and Random Forest. We compare the performance of all these techniques on four different NWP data sets. Downscaling the temperatures clearly improved the temperature forecasts with respect to the raw NWP output, and also with respect to the basic mean bias correction. Multivariate methods generally yielded better results. but the advantage of using non-linear algorithms was small if not negligible.

J	Ladunga, I				Ladunga, Istvan			More complete gene silencing by fewer siRNAs: transparent optimized design and biophysical signature	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							RNA SECONDARY STRUCTURE; STRUCTURE PREDICTION; VECTOR MACHINES; ANTISENSE; SELECTION; EFFICACY; INTERFERENCE; ALGORITHMS; OLIGONUCLEOTIDES; SEQUENCES	Highly accurate knockdown functional analyses based on RNA interference (RNAi) require the possible most complete hydrolysis of the targeted mRNA while avoiding the degradation of untargeted genes (off-target effects). This in turn requires significant improvements to target selection for two reasons. First, the average silencing activity of randomly selected siRNAs is as low as 62%. Second, applying more than five different siRNAs may lead to saturation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and to the degradation of untargeted genes. Therefore, selecting a small number of highly active siRNAs is critical for maximizing knockdown and minimizing off-target effects. To satisfy these needs, a publicly available and transparent machine learning tool is presented that ranks all possible siRNAs for each targeted gene. Support vector machines (SVMs) with polynomial kernels and constrained optimization models select and utilize the most predictive effective combinations from 572 sequence, thermodynamic, accessibility and self-hairpin features over 2200 published siRNAs. This tool reaches an accuracy of 92.3% in cross-validation experiments. We fully present the underlying biophysical signature that involves free energy, accessibility and dinucleotide characteristics. We show that while complete silencing is possible at certain structured target sites, accessibility information improves the prediction of the 90% active siRNA target sites. Fast siRNA activity predictions can be performed on our web server at http://optirna.unl.edu/.

The statistical methods are based on amino acid composition, reside pair preference and motifs. In machine learning techniques, the combination of amino acid and dipeptide compositions has been used as main attributes. In addition, annotations have been made using the criterion based on the identification of beta-barrel membrane proteins and exclusion of globular and transmembrane helical proteins. A web interface has been developed for identifying the annotated beta-barrel membrane proteins in all known genomes. The users have the feasibility of selecting the genome from the three kingdoms of life, archaea, bacteria and eukaryote, and five different methods. Further, the statistics for all genomes have been provided along with the links to different algorithms and related databases. It is freely available at http://tmbeta-genome.cbrc.jp/annotation/.

The Protein Classification Benchmark collection (http://hydra.icgeb.trieste.it/benchmark) was created in order to provide standard datasets on which the performance of machine learning methods can be compared. It is primarily meant for method developers and users interested in comparing methods under standardized conditions. The collection contains datasets of sequences and structures, and each set is subdivided into positive/negative, training/test sets in several ways. There is a total of 6405 classification tasks, 3297 on protein sequences, 3095 on protein structures and 10 on protein coding regions in DNA. Typical tasks include the classification of structural domains in the SCOP and CATH databases based on their sequences or structures, as well as various functional and taxonomic classification problems. In the case of hierarchical classification schemes, the classification tasks can be defined at various levels of the hierarchy (such as classes, folds, superfamilies, etc.). For each dataset there are distance matrices available that contain all vs. all comparison of the data, based on various sequence or structure comparison methods, as well as a set of classification performance measures computed with various classifier algorithms.

Nevertheless distinguishing between healthy and ill images is hard even for an experienced radiologist, because a single image usually includes several regions of interest (ROIs). The hardness of this classification problem along with the substantial amount of data, gathered from patients' medical history, motivates the use of a machine learning approach as part of a CAD (Computer Aided Detection) tool, aiming to assist radiologists in the characterization of mammography images. Specifically, our approach involves: i) the ROI extraction, ii) the Feature Vector extraction, iii) the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of ROIs and iv) the characterization of the whole image. We evaluate the performance of our approach in terms of the SVM's training and testing error and in terms of ROI specificity - sensitivity. The results show a relation between the number of features used and the SVM's performance.

Anomalies by virtue of their defmition are events that occur spontaneously with no prior indication of their existence or appearance. Effects of anomalies are typically unknown until they actually occur, and their effects aggregate in time to show noticeable change from the original behavior. An evolved behavior would in general be very difficult to correct unless the anomalous event that caused such behavior can be detected early, and any consequence attributed to the specific anomaly. Substantial time and effort is required to back-track the cause for abnormal behavior and to recreate the event sequence leading to abnormal behavior. There is a critical need therefore to automatically detect anomalous behavior as and when they may occur, and to do so with the operator in the loop. Human-machine interaction results in better machine learning and a better decision-support mechanism. This is the fundamental concept of intelligent control where machine learning is enhanced by interaction with human operators, and vice versa. The paper discusses a revolutionary framework for the characterization, detection, identification, learning, and modeling of anomalous behavior in observed phenomena arising from a large class of unknown and uncertain dynamical systems.

We discuss a novel control methodology for autonomous monitoring of space habitats and in-situ ground and ocean-based heterogeneous wireless distributed sensor networks. Such sensor networks need to have a lifetime of months or even years, while being effective at detecting and reporting events in real-time before they pose a danger. This requires an on-line resource manager or controller to economize and adaptively control all resources such as energy, communication bandwidth, and sensor sampling frequency. We present an event based control optimization formulation of the resource management problem for sensor networks and discuss a method to adaptively change desired system performance of the sensor network in response to events. This functionality is critical in rield-deployable sensor networks where continuous operation is expensive and system adaptation is critical for extended operation in the face of dynamic external events. We show results on various synthetic heterogeneous sensor networks where only partially accurate information about the sensing system is available and illustrate the efficacy of the control algorithm in handling such incorrect models with a negligible increase in transmission of the optimal control settings. We show that the run-time performance of the control algorithm scales well with increasing number of sensors.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have the ability to learns from data, inferring from examples a general hypothesis that can approximate complex relationships in the data for descriptive or predictive aims. The ML is particularly useful for poorly understood domains due to the lack of a clear theory where, however, there are collections of relevant real-world data, which can be affected by uncertain or noise, or characterized by complex relationships that standard approaches cannot properly face. The achievement of successful results for problems in biochemical and medical domains may require the integration of different type of data (such as clinical, genetic, biochemical data), together with computational task (including descriptive or predictive purpose), model design, and learning methods. This survey summarizes typical aspects of the ML approach to problems and tasks, and treats the characteristics of data sets, models, tools, and evaluation techniques, in the context of their application in medical data analysis and bioinformatics, with emphasis on emergent approaches and research perspectives. Finally, we present and discuss some recent results, as a test application of a rule-based evolutionary classifier system to a concrete example of clinical and genetic data set, built up for studies on the susceptibility to cancer.

This paper presents a comprehensive and competitive study in multi-class neural learning with focuses on issues including neural network architecture, encoding schemes, training methodology and training time complexity. Our study includes multi-class pattern classification using either a system of multiple neural networks or a single neural network, and modeling pattern classes using one-against-all, one-against-one, one-against-higher-order, and P-against-Q. We also discuss implementations of these approaches and analyze training time complexity associated with each approach. We evaluate six different neural network system architectures for multi-class pattern classification along the dimensions of imbalanced data, large number of pattern classes, large vs. small training data through experiments conducted on well-known benchmark data.

J	Garcia-Pedrajas, N; Ortiz-Boyer, D				Garcia-Pedrajas, Nicolas; Ortiz-Boyer, Domingo			A cooperative constructive method for neural networks for pattern recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						constructive algorithms; pattern classification; evolutionary computation; neural networks; cooperative coevolution	DECISION TREES; COMBINING CLASSIFIERS; NEGATIVE CORRELATION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; REGRESSION PROBLEMS; CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLES; BACKPROPAGATION; REGULARIZATION; PREDICTORS	In this paper, we propose a new constructive method, based on cooperative coevolution, for designing automatically the structure of a neural network for classification. Our approach is based on a modular construction of the neural network by means of a cooperative evolutionary process. This process benefits from the advantages of coevolutionary computation as well as the advantages of constructive methods. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to work with almost any kind of classifier. The evaluation of each module that constitutes the network is made using a multiobjective method. So, each new module can be evaluated in a comprehensive way, considering different aspects, such as performance, complexity, or degree of cooperation with the previous modules of the network. In this way, the method has the advantage of considering not only the performance of the networks, but also other features. The method is tested on 40 classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository with very good performance. The method is thoroughly compared with two other constructive methods, cascade correlation and GMDH networks, and other classification methods, namely, SVM, C4.5, and k nearest-neighbours, and an ensemble of neural networks constructed using four different methods.

J	Liu, Y; Zhang, DS; Lu, GJ; Ma, WY				Liu, Ying; Zhang, Dengsheng; Lu, Guojun; Ma, Wei-Ying			A survey of content-based image retrieval with high-level semantics	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Review						content-based image retrieval; semantic gap; high-level semantics; survey	RELEVANCE FEEDBACK; COLOR; SIMILARITY; SEGMENTATION; FEATURES; DESCRIPTORS; DATABASES; SYSTEM	In order to improve the retrieval accuracy of content-based image retrieval systems, research focus has been shifted from designing sophisticated low-level feature extraction algorithms to reducing the 'semantic gap' between the visual features and the richness of human semantics. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive survey of the recent technical achievements in high-level semantic-based image retrieval. Major recent publications are included in this survey covering different aspects of the research in this area, including low-level image feature extraction, similarity measurement, and deriving high-level semantic features. We identify five major categories of the state-of-the-art techniques in narrowing down the 'semantic gap': (1) using object ontology to define high-level concepts; (2) using machine learning methods to associate low-level features with query concepts; (3) using relevance feedback to learn users' intention; (4) generating semantic template to support high-level image retrieval; (5) fusing the evidences from HTML text and the visual content of images for WWW image retrieval. In addition, some other related issues such as image test bed and retrieval performance evaluation are also discussed. Finally, based on existing technology and the demand from real-world applications, a few promising future research directions are suggested. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.

The algorithm is simple, easily programmed and is shown to perform as well as or better than a number of leading machine learning algorithms on a substantial benchmark. It is then applied to a set of extreme small-sample-size problems in virtual screening where it is found to be less accurate than a currently leading approach but is still comparable in a number of cases.

Robust approach for estimating probabilities in naive-Bayes classifier	PATTERN RECOGNITION AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence	DEC 18-22, 2007	Calcutta, INDIA	Indian Stat Inst, Machine Intelligence Univ, ISI Ctr Soft Comp Res, Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, Int Ctr Pure & Appl Math, Web Intelligence Consortium, Yahoo India Res & Dev, Philips Res Asia				Naive-Bayes classifier is a popular technique of classification in machine learning. Improving the accuracy of naive-Bayes classifier will be significant as it has great importance in classification using numerical attributes. For numeric attributes, the conditional probabilities are either modeled by some continuous probability distribution over the range of that attribute's values or by conversion of numeric attribute to discrete one using discretization. The limitation of the classifier using discretization is that it does not classify those instances for which conditional probabilities of any of the attribute value for every class is zero. The proposed method resolves this limitation of estimating probabilities in the naive-Bayes classifier and improve the classification accuracy for noisy data. The proposed method is efficient and robust in estimating probabilities in the naive-Bayes classifier. The proposed method has been tested over a number of databases of UCI machine learning repository and the comparative results of existing naive-Bayes classifier and proposed method has also been illustrated.

The basis of the combination is that efficient concept learning is possible in many cases when the concepts learned from different approaches are combined to a more efficient concept. The experimental result of the algorithm, EMRL in a representative collection of different domain shows that it performs significantly better than the several state-of-the-art individual classifier, in case of 11 domains out of 25 data sets whereas the state-of-the-art individual classifier performs significantly better than EMRL only in 5 cases.

These residue level properties (RLPs) have been frequently predicted using neural networks and other machine learning algorithms. Here we present an algorithm to dynamically exclude from the neural network training, examples which are most difficult to separate. This algorithm automatically filters out statistical outliers causing noise and makes training faster without losing network ability to generalize. Different methods of sampling data for neural network training have been tried and their impact on learning has been analyzed.

We found that the occurrence of Ser, Asn and Gln is significantly higher in TMBs than globular proteins, which might be due to their importance in the formation of P-barrel structures in the membrane, stability of binding pockets and the function of TMBs. Utilizing this information, we have devised statistical methods and machine learning techniques to discriminate TMBs from other folding types of globular and membrane proteins and we obtained the maximum accuracy of 96%. Further, we have devised protocols for identifying the membrane spanning P-strand segments and detecting TMBs in genomic sequences.

Although many of these methods can achieve high accuracy, they generally lack comprehensibility of the classification process. In this paper a new method for interpretation of small ensembles of classifiers is used on gene expression data from real-world dataset. It was shown that interactive interpretation systems that were developed for classical machine learning problems also give a great range of possibilities for the scientists in the bioinformatics field. Therefore we chose a gene expression dataset discriminating three types of Leukemia as a testbed for the proposed Visual Interpretation of Small Ensembles (VISE) tool. Our results show that using the accuracy of ensembles and adding comprehensibility gains not only accurate but also results that can possibly represent new knowledge on specific gene functions.

The method has three major steps: 1. The images are first segmented to find potential hemorrhage regions using ellipse fitting, background removal and wavelet decomposition technique; 2. For each region, features (such as area, major axis length, etc.) are extracted; 3. Each extracted feature is classified using machine learning algorithm; the images are then classified based on its component regions' classification. The automatic medical image classification will be useful in building a content-based medical image retrieval system.

J	Martinez-Munoz, G; Suarez, A				Martinez-Munoz, Gonzalo; Suarez, Alberto			Using boosting to prune bagging ensembles	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						machine learning; decision trees; bagging; boosting; ensembles; ensemble pruning	DECISION TREES	Boosting is used to determine the order in which classifiers are aggregated in a bagging ensemble. Early stopping in the aggregation of the classifiers in the ordered bagging ensemble allows the identification of subensembles that require less memory for storage, classify faster and can improve the generalization accuracy of the original bagging ensemble. In all the classification problems investigated pruned ensembles with 20% of the original classifiers show statistically significant improvements over bagging. In problems where boosting is superior to bagging, these improvements are not sufficient to reach the accuracy of the corresponding boosting ensembles. However, ensemble pruning preserves the performance of bagging in noisy classification tasks, where boosting often has larger generalization errors. Therefore, pruned bagging should generally be preferred to complete bagging and, if no information about the level of noise is available, it is a robust alternative to AdaBoost.

For efficiency, a rectification of the catadioptric image using a virtual cylindrical camera is employed. We propose a novel hybrid combination of a boosted cascade of wavelet-based classifiers with a subsequent texture-based neural network involving adaptive local features as final cascade stage. Within this framework, both fast object detection and powerful object classification are combined to increase the robustness of the recognition system. Further, we compare the hybrid cascade framework to a state-of-the-art multi-cue pedestrian recognition system utilizing shape and texture cues. Image distortions of the objects of interest due to the virtual cylindrical camera transformation are both explicitly and implicitly addressed by shape transformations and machine learning techniques. In extensive experiments, both systems under consideration are evaluated on a real-world urban traffic dataset. Results show the contributions of the various components in isolation and document superior performance of the proposed hybrid cascade system.

S	Saunders, C; Demco, A		Hammer, B; Hitzler, P		Saunders, Craig; Demco, Anthony			Kernels for Strings and Graphs	PERSPECTIVES OF NEURAL-SYMBOLIC INTEGRATION	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							CLASSIFICATION	Over recent years, kernel methods have become a powerful and popular collection of tools that machine learning researchers can add to the box of tricks at their disposal. One desirable aspect of these methods is the 'plug and play' nature of the kernel: if one can construct a kernel function over the data they wish to analyse, then it is straightforward to employ Support Vector Machines, Kernel PCA, Dual Ridge Regression, or any other of the myriad of techniques available. In order for these techniques to work on symbolic or discrete data, it is therefore sufficient to define a valid kernel for the type of data in question. The kernel approach therefore gives one perspective on learning with symbolic data that is very flexible and widely applicable. Researchers have shown how such kernels can be defined from different perspectives, and this has lead to the successful creation of a number of structure kernels, principally those that operate on strings, trees and graphs. In this chapter we shall provide a brief review of kernels for structures and concentrate on the domains of strings and graphs. The former of which was one of the first structures to be tackled and is still widely used for biologically-related applications; the latter is somewhat newer and here we present the state-of-the-art and some novel additions to the graph kernel family.

Inspired by the PageRank and the Hubs & Authorities algorithms for networked data, we introduce the NeuronRank algorithm, which assigns a source value and a sink value to each neuron in the network. Source and sink values are used as structural features for predicting the activity dynamics of biological neural networks. Our results show that NeuronRank based structural features call successfully predict average firing rates in the network, as well as the firing rate of output neurons reflecting the network population activity. They also indicate that link mining is a promising technique for discovering structure-activity relations in neural information processing.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is successfully applied to the key parameters extracted from Entropy Decomposition to obtain good image classifications. In this paper, this novel classifier has been applied on a multi-crop region of Flevoland, Netherlands with multi-polarization data for crop type classification. Validation of the classifiers has been carried out by comparing the classified image obtained from EDSVM classifier and SVM. The EDSVM classifier demonstrates the advantages of the valuable decomposed parameters and statistical machine learning theory in performing better results compared with the SVM classifier. The final outcome of this research clearly indicates that EDSVM has the ability in improving the classification accuracy for agricultural crop type classification.

A high-quality error report allows if user to understand and correct the problem. Unfortunately. the quality of error reports has been decreasing, as software becomes more complex and layered. End-Users take the cryptic error messages given to them by programs and Struggle to fix their problems using search engines and Support websites. Developers cannot improve their error messages when they receive an ambiguous or otherwise insufficient error indicator from a black-box software component. We introduce Clarify, a system that improves error reporting by classifying application behavior. Clarify uses minimally invasive monitoring to generate a behavior profile, which is a summary of the program's execution history. A machine learning classifier uses the behavior profile to classify the application's behavior, thereby enabling a more precise error report than the output of the application itself. We evaluate a prototype Clarify system oil ambiguous error messages generated by large, modern applications like gcc, LaTeX, and the Linux kernel. For, a performance cost of less than 1% Oil user applications and 4.7% on the Linux kernel, the prototype correctly disambiguates at least 85% of application behaviors that result in ambiguous error reports. This accuracy does not degrade significantly with more behaviors: a Clarify classifier for 81 LaTeX error messages is at most 2.5% less accurate than a classifier for 27 LaTeX error messages. Finally, we show that without any human effort to build a classifier, Clarify call provide nearest-neighbor software support, where users who experience a problem are told about 5 Other users who might have had the same problem.

Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; SYSTEMS-BIOLOGY; DATA SETS; NETWORKS; GENOME; K-12; RECONSTRUCTION; IDENTIFICATION; INACTIVATION	Machine learning approaches offer the potential to systematically identify transcriptional regulatory interactions from a compendium of microarray expression profiles. However, experimental validation of the performance of these methods at the genome scale has remained elusive. Here we assess the global performance of four existing classes of inference algorithms using 445 Escherichia coli Affymetrix arrays and 3,216 known E. coli regulatory interactions from RegulonDB. We also developed and applied the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, a novel extension of the relevance networks class of algorithms. CLR demonstrates an average precision gain of 36% relative to the next-best performing algorithm. At a 60% true positive rate, CLR identifies 1,079 regulatory interactions, of which 338 were in the previously known network and 741 were novel predictions. We tested the predicted interactions for three transcription factors with chromatin immunoprecipitation, confirming 21 novel interactions and verifying our RegulonDB-based performance estimates. CLR also identified a regulatory link providing central metabolic control of iron transport, which we confirmed with real-time quantitative PCR. The compendium of expression data compiled in this study, coupled with RegulonDB, provides a valuable model system for further improvement of network inference algorithms using experimental data.

Examples include both linear and non-linear algorithms such as singular value decomposition (SVD), regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and several machine learning algorithms based on Expectation Maximization (EM). The non-linear algorithms aggregate user data only in certain steps, such as conjugate gradient, which are linear in per-user data. We introduce a new and highly efficient VSS (Verifiable Secret-Sharing) protocol in a special but widely-applicable model that allows secret-shared arithmetic operations in such aggregation steps to be done over small fields (e.g. 32 or 64 bits), so that private arithmetic operations have the same cost as normal arithmetic. Verification of user data is required to prevent a malicious user from biasing the computation. We provide a random projection method for verification that uses a linear number of inexpensive small field operations, and only a logarithmic number of large-field (1024 bits or more) cryptographic operations. Our implementation shows that the approach can achieve orders of magnitude reduction in running time over standard techniques (from hours to seconds) for large scale problems (e.g. at the scale where the number of values per user is 10(6)).

Despite its success and popularity, it still has some drawbacks in certain situations. In particular, the SVM classifier can be very sensitive to outliers in the training sample. Moreover, the number of support vectors (SVs) can be very large in many applications. To solve these problems, [WL06] proposed a new SVM variant, the robust truncated-hinge-loss SVM (RSVM), which uses a truncated hinge loss. In this paper, we apply the operation of truncation on the multicategory hinge loss proposed by [LLW04]. We show that the proposed robust multicategory truncated-hinge-loss SVM (RMSVM) is more robust to outliers and deliver more accurate classifiers using a smaller set of SVs than the original multicategory SVM (MSVM) proposed by [LLW04].

The proposed control method, based on the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, back propagation from the final co-state error and gradient descent, allows training an adaptive fuzzy inference system to estimate values for the optimal co-state variables. This approach allows finding a solution to the optimal control problem on-line by training the system, which can be used on a close-loop control strategy. The design of control system is developed by minimizing a quadratic performance index selected for the desired operating conditions. Successful simulations results of controlling the system are presented.

Learning time for these problems from scratch is typically very long. For supervised learning, several methods have been proposed to reuse existing knowledge in previous similar tasks. However, for unsupervised learning such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), it is difficult to apply directly these algorithms. This paper presents several methods which have the potential of transferring of knowledge in RL using RNN: Directed Transfer, Cascade-Correlation, Mixture of Expert Systems, and Two-Level Architecture. Preliminary results of experiments in the E maze domain show the potential of these methods. Knowledge based learning time for a new problem is much shorter learning time from scratch even thought the new task looks very different from the previous tasks.

However, they suffer from an inherent ART problem, that of creating larger architectures than it is necessary to solve the problem at hand (referred to as the ART category proliferation problem). This problem is especially amplified for classification problems which have noisy data, and/or data, belonging to different labels, that significantly overlap. A variety of modified ART architectures, referred to as semisupervised (ss) ART architectures (e.g., ssFAM, ssEAM, ssGAM), summarily referred to as ssART, have addressed the category proliferation problem. In this paper, we are proposing another approach of solving the ART category proliferation problem, by designing genetically engineered ART architectures, such as GFAM, GEAM, GGAM, summarily referred to as GART. In particular, in this paper, we explain how to design GART architectures and compare their performance (in terms of accuracy, size, and computational complexity) with the performance of the ssART architectures. Our results demonstrate that GART is superior to ssART, and quite often it produces the optimal classifier.

However if the pre-specified number of clusters is modified, the precision of each result also changes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new clustering algorithm based on the Kea keyphrase extraction algorithm which returns several keyphrases from the source documents by using some machine learning techniques. In this paper documents are grouped into several clusters like K-means, but the number of clusters is automatically determined by the algorithm with some heuristics using the extracted keyphrases. Our Kea-means clustering algorithm provides easy and efficient ways to extract test documents from massive quantities of resources.

So by employing the prediction results, agents can modify their own negotiation strategies in order to achieve an agreement much quicker or to look after much higher benefits. Even, though some of prediction strategies have been proposed by researchers, most of them are based on machine learning mechanisms which require a training process in advance. However in most circumstances, the machine learning approaches might not work well for some kinds of agents whose behaviors are excluded in the training data. In order to address this issue, we propose three regression functions to predict agents' behaviors in this paper which are linear power and quadratic regression functions. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed functions can estimate partners' potential behaviors successfully and efficiently in different circumstances.

One-against-one neural networks are applied to interval neutrosophic sets (INS). INS associates a set of truth, false and indeterminacy membership values with an output. Multiple pairs of the truth binary, neural network and the false binary neural network are trained to predict multiple pairs of the truth and false membership values. The difference between each pair of truth and false membership values is considered as vagueness in the classification and formed as the indeterminacy membership value. The three memberships obtained from each pair of networks constitute an interval neutrosophic set. Multiple interval neutrosophic sets are then created and used to support decision making in multiclass classification. We have applied our technique to three classical benchmark problems including balance, wine, and yeast from the UCI machine learning repository. Our approach has improved classification performance compared to an existing one-against-one technique which applies only to the truth membership values.

In this study, a new feature selection approach that combines the Fisher criterion and principal feature analysis (PFA) is proposed in order to identify the important (relevant and irredundant) feature subset. The Fisher criterion is used to remove features that are noisy or irrelevant, and then PFA is used to choose a subset of principal features. The proposed approach was evaluated in pattern classification on five publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can largely reduce the feature dimensionality with little loss of classification accuracy.

This calls for reliable weather information, which in turn helps farmers make management decisions about their crops. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Computational model for Agro-MEteoroLogical data (CAMEL). The model serves three purposes. First, it effectively captures important information about large amounts of data collected from various weather stations distributed in a wide geographic expanse. Second, the proposed model learns from historical data and predicts future trends. This helps us obtain accurate weather forecasts. Third, through the prediction of weather trends, CAMEL gives us a better understanding of agro-meteorological data. When we compare the predicted results with the observed data, any significant difference between them may be an indication of equipment malfunction or other problems. In this way, CAMEL helps us detect abnormal data and facilitates in guarding against potential sources of error. Consequently, well-functioning equipment and accurate weather data help farmers make wise crop management decisions.

In this paper, an back-propagation neural network is designed and implemented, which builds classification model by considering the behavior-based features revealed from emails' headers and syslogs. Since spamming behaviors are infrequently changed, compared with the change frequency of keywords used in spams, behavior-based features are more robust with respect to the change of time; so that the behavior-based filtering mechanism outperform keyword-based filtering. The experimental results indicate that our methods are more useful in distinguishing spam emails than that of keyword-based comparison.

In pattern classification, if many dimensions of two groups share a similar distribution, the classification error rates will be 50%. We have proposed a new clustering algorithm to deal with this problem. Its basic idea is to confine the support of the optimization equation so that the data points in one group can only have small contribution to the estimated cluster center in another group. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to yield good results in eight real world data sets and its performance is better than 10 existing methods.	[Lam, Benson S.

However, the theory can not handle the small samples statistical learning problems on set-valued probability space which widely exists in real world. This paper discussed statistical learning theory on a special kind of set-valued probability space. Firstly, we shall give the definition of random vectors and the definition of the distributed function and the expectation of random vectors, and then we will give the definition of the expected risk functional, the empirical risk functional and the definition of the consistency of the principle (method) of empirical risk minimization (ERM) on set-valued probability space. Finally, we will give and prove the key theorem of learning theory on set-valued probability space, which has laid the theoretical foundation for us to establish the statistical learning theory on probability space.

We extend the notion of a nested set of models onto the problem of time-varying regression estimation, which implies, in addition to the generic challenge of choosing the subset of regressors, also the inevitable necessity to choose the appropriate level of model volatility, ranging from the full stationarity of instant models in time to their absolute independence of each other. So, there are, at least, two axes of model nesting in the problem of nonstationary regression estimation, first, the relevant size of the set of regressors and, second, the level of model volatility in time. We use the leave-one-out measure of the model fit as quality indicator along both nesting axes. We apply the proposed technique to analysis of a hedge fund's returns and reverse-engineering its strategies.

We present a fast implementation of C4.5 algorithm, named FC4.5(Fast C4.5). It organizes novel data structures, uses the indirect bucket-sort combined with the bit-parallel technique, and confines the binary-search of the cutoff within the narrowest range. The combination of these techniques enables FC4.5 greatly accelerates the tree construction process of C4.5 algorithm. Experiments show that FC4.5 can build the same decision tree as C4.5 (Release 8) system and the runtime performance gain up to 5.8 times. Besides, FC4.5 also achieves a good scalability on different kinds of datasets.

If the methods of Machine Learning can be used to assess poetry style, it will be more objective. This paper brings forward a method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM for short) to differentiate bold-and-unconstrained style from graceful-and-restrained style of poetry. In this work, a piece of poetry is expressed using Vector Space Model (VSM for short) first, and then we use information gain to select the poetry's feature terms. At last, we use an SVM-based method to divide the style of poetry. Meanwhile, feature numbers and feature items for poetry style's influence are also analyzed. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by a series of experiments with interesting results.

Many text mining researches has been conducted, like text categorization, information retrieval, text clustering. When machine learning methods or statistical models are applied to such a large scale of data, the first step we have to solve is to represent a text document into the way that computers could handle. Traditionally, single words are always employed as features in Vector Space Model, which make up the feature space for all text documents. The single-word based representation is based on the word independence and doesn't consider their relations, which may cause information missing. This paper proposes Wiki-Query segmented features to text classification, in hopes of better using the text information. The experiment results show that a much better F1 value has been achieved than that of classical single-word based text representation. This means that Wikipedia and query segmented feature could better represent a text document.	[Li, Bing; Chen, Qing-Cai; Yeung, Daniel S.; Ng, Wing W.

In this algorithm we use data expansion treating it with a weight value and the probability techniques. It is applied to extending a classifier which is considered the optimal projection plane based on Fisher's formula. For doing this, we will derive equations from the procedure to be applied to the data expansion. The result is compared to that of different measurements by choosing one variable in the data set and then modifying the rate of missing and non-missing values in this selected variable. The result of a data set with non-missing variable compares with that of C4.5 which is known as a knowledge acquisition tool in machine learning.

It is generally believed that many subspace learning algorithms can be considered as linear cases of graph-based manifold learning with special edge weights. We develop a robust subspace learning method by designing reasonable edge weights which give rise to good generalization. The value of the edge weights can reflect the distribution of the data of each class and thus the consequent subspace may have good generalization property. Experiments results on face recognition show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose a strong covering algorithm (called SCA) for generating strong classification rules and view the rules-based classifier as a component classifier in the ensemble text classifier. SCA extracts noun phrase to index document based-on our proposed Exhaustive Noun-Phrase Extraction Algorithm. Experimental results show that the ensemble classifier integrating the strong rules achieves an approximately 8% improvement as compared to bi-gram classifier and 15% improvement as compared to the single rule-based classifier.

However, it cannot be easily scaled to handle large scale problems for its time and space complexity that is around quadratic with respect to the number of training samples. This paper proposes to combine distributed SVMs by simple Bayesian formalism rules (B-SVMs). B-SVMs randomly decomposes a large-scale task into many smaller and simpler sub-tasks in training phase and uses simple Bayesian formalism rules to make decision for final classification in test phase. B-SVMs was compared with single SVMs that is trained on entire training data set, parallel SVMs combined by majority voting (MV-SVMs), and one kind of fast modular SVMs (FM-SVMs). Experimental results on four problems show that B-SVMs can get higher accuracy than MV-SVMs and FM-SVMs does, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce training and test time. More importantly, it produces test accuracy that is almost the same as single SVMs does.

Bayesian model needs the feature independent assumption; Artificial Neural Network suffers from the overfitting problem; Support vector machine (SVM) does not do well in real-value feature. This paper proposes to combine entropy and machine learning techniques for document classification. Firstly, the cross entropy and average mutual information are presented to effectively extract the features. Secondly, the support vector machine and maximum entropy model is adopted respectively to perform the classification task in the feature space. Furthermore, an improved feature description instead the binary feature with the real-value is presented in this text, since the prior knowledge of each word is helpful to document classification. Finally, we compare our method with the traditional methods, and the experiment showed our method increased 2.78 % F-measures than basic ME model, and 0.95% than naive bayes model which was smoothed by Good-Turing algorithm.

Instead of the traditional methods which treated the Chinese overlapping ambiguity as classification problem, the proposed approach regards this task as a sequence labeling problem. The best benefit of this method is that it can deal with overlapping ambiguous strings with any lengths no matter the ambiguous strings are pseudo ambiguity or true ambiguity. Several methods are tested on the same training and test corpora. The experimental results show that the CRF models achieve state-of-the-art performance. In comparison with the Maximum Entropy Classifier and the traditional Word Bigram Model, the accuracy has increased 3.98% and 9.27% respectively.

In contrast, non-review documents often present factual information objectively. Separating reviews from non-reviews, or subjectivity classification, is potentially important for many text processing applications, such as information extraction and information retrieval. Also, it is a key process in sentiment classification for online customer reviews. As a type of genre classification, the classifications of subjective and objective texts are different from traditional topic-based classifications. Not many studies have been conducted in this domain and most of them were on English texts. Little work has been done on Chinese subjectivity classification. However, the detailed techniques used in English texts can not be applied directly to Chinese due to the different characteristics between these two languages. This paper proposes an. approach to perform subjectivity classification on Chinese text based on a supervised machine learning. algorithm,Naive Bayes.

We describe an approach to simulating human game-play using a variety of AI techniques, including simulated annealing, decision tree learning and case-based reasoning. We have implemented an AI-bot that uses a novel approach to planning fleet movements and attacks. This retrieves plans from a case base of previous games, then merges these using a method based on decision tree learning. In addition, we have implemented more sophisticated control over low-level actions such as firing missiles and guiding planes. In particular, we have written routines to enable the AI-bot to synchronise bombing runs, and enabled a simulated annealing approach to assigning bombing targets to planes and opponent cities to missiles. We describe how our AI-bot operates, and the experimentation we have performed in order to determine an optimal configuration for it. With this configuration, our AI-bot beat Introversion's finite state machine automated player in 76.7% of 150 matches played.

It is very significant for the derivative price, risk control, market management and price forecasting to research the scale property of price fluctuation data. Recent studies have revealed that emerging modern machine learning techniques are advantageous to statistical models for time series forecasting, such as artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR). Least squares support vector machine achieves faster speed at the cost of loosing the sparseness. In this paper, we propose a new method, called multi-scale sparse least squares support vector machine (MS-LS-SVM), to design futures price forecasting system, and achieve the multi-scale decomposition, modeling for the sub-systems and the integration adaptively. The multi-scale decomposition for the original data is obtained by wavelet packet decomposition and the correlations among these scales are obtained by the way of learning MS-LS-SVM. Experiments in futures time series prediction demonstrate that MS-LS-SVM can achieve excellent performance and sparseness at the same time. In addition, the effect of different scales for the output can be achieved. The proposed method improves the interpretability and gives another way for model evaluation.

Further, classified traffic is required to understand how the Internet is being used, and to effectively control the services that traffic receives. In this paper we present a machine-learning approach that accurately classifies live traffic using C4.5 decision tree. By collecting 12 features at the start of the flows, without inspecting the packet payload, our method can identify live traffic of different types of applications with 99.8% total accuracy. Moreover, accuracy is not our only concern; we also consider the latency and throughput as of high importance.

The EEGs can be heavily corrupted by cardiac, eye movement, muscle and noise artifacts, so that EEG experts need to automatically detect them with a given level of confidence. In theory, the BMA methodology allows experts to evaluate the confidence in decision making most accurately. However. the non-stationary nature of EEGs makes the use of this methodology difficult. In our experiments with the sleep EEGs, the proposed BMA technique is shown to provide a better performance in terms of predictive accuracy.

The goal is to investigate whether separate classifications across a number of subband signals, combined Using appropriate machine learning algorithms, can provide performance similar to classification performed directly on the original acoustic waveforms, If this is the case, then combining subband classifications might lead to speech recognition algorithms that are robust to linear filtering and narrow-hand noise. We perform proof-of-concept experiments oil three binary phoneme classification tasks of varying difficulty using Support Vector Machine subband classifiers which are combined by simple and weighted voting techniques as well as stacked generalization methods. We find that combining subband classifiers improves performance and that the improvement becomes more marked as the number of subbands increases.

The mixed signals are characterized by a nonlinear state space model which models both the statistical properties of the source signals and the overall nonlinear mixing process. A novel algorithm based on maximum likelihood framework has been rigorously developed for estimating the parameters in the model as well as inferring the source signals. In the proposed model, the nonlinear distortion function is modeled by using high order polynomials which enable the model to be formulated and optimized in a tractable manner. The strength of the proposed approach lies in the closed estimation of the source signals and the adaptive optimization procedure of the model parameters. This has resulted in high performance accuracy, fast convergence and efficient implementation of the estimation algorithm. Simulation has been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the obtained results have shown 50% better accuracy than conventional nonlinear algorithms.

In this paper, a new method based on machine learning and computational auditory, scene analysis (CASA) is suggested to separate the monaural speech of two-talker The technique of machine learning is used to learn the grouping cues on isolated clean data from single speaker. By using a factorial max vector quantization model (MAXVYQ) to infer the masking signals needed in resynthesis, the objective of separation is accomplished The results of experiment on a standard corpus show that this proposed method could separate the mixed speech of two speakers very well. The SNR of the separated speech are improved obviously.

Their high frequencies make anaphora resolution one key problem in discourse processing which attract attention of increasing researchers. In the paper, according to features of Chinese personal pronoun we present an approach which is based on corpus. It adopts maximum entropy method. Then we discovered characteristic of pronoun anaphora referring to inhuman is different form that referring to people. So the paper put forward a new approach about processing the Chinese personal pronoun anaphora. The approach divided the anaphora resolution system into two parts, the PARS subsystem and the IARS subsystem. They will separately process the personal pronoun anaphora referring to people and that referring to inhuman. The paper described the design and the realization of the system, tests the new system in the Chinese Tree Bank and evaluates the arithmetic in the round. The experiment demonstrates that the method achieves the desired result.

The chief aim of the present work is to compare four machine learning methods to sentiment classification of Chinese review. The corpus is made up of 16000 reviews from website. We investigate the factors which affect the performance: namely feature representation via Word-Based Unigram (WBU), Bigram (WBB) and Chinese CharacterBased Bigram (CBB), Trigram (CBT); feature weighting schemes and feature dimensionality. Experimental evaluations show that performance depends on different settings. As a result, we draw a conclusion that Naive Bayes (NB) classifier obtains the best averaging performance when using WBB, CBT as features with bool weighting under different dimensionality to the task.

The paper presents a method of Chinese shallow Paring based on Support Vector machines (SVMs). Conventional recognition techniques based on Machine Learning have difficulty in selecting useful features as well as finding appropriate combination of selected features. SVMs can automatically focus on useful features and robustly handle a large feature set to develop models that maximize their generalizability,. On the other hand, it is well known that SVMs achieve high generalization of very high dimensional feature space. Furthermore.. by introducing the Kernel principle, SVMs can earn, out the training in high-dimensional space with smaller computational cost independent of their dimensionality. The experiments produced promising results.		Guo, YS (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Nat Language Proc Lab, Shenyang 110004, Peoples R China.

However, in realistic domains, system dynamics often change based on unobserved external contexts such as work load or contact conditions with other objects. Previous multiple model approaches to solving this problem are restricted to finite, discrete contexts without any generalization and have been tested only on linear systems. We present a framework for estimation of context through hidden latent variable extraction - solely from experienced (non-finear) dynamics. This work refines the multiple model formalism to bootstrap context separation from context-unlabeled data and enables simultaneous online context estimation, dynamics learning and control based on a consistent probabilistic formulation. Most importantly, it extends the framework to a continuous latent model representation of context under specific assumptions of load distribution.

Taking some ideas from machine learning methods, we propose a novel geographic routing algorithm for WSN, named Q-Probabilistic Routing (Q-PR), that makes intelligent routing decisions from the delayed reward of previous actions and the local interaction among neighbor nodes, by using reinforcement learning and a Bayesian decision model. Moreover, by considering the message importance embedded in the message itself, routing decisions can-be adapted to traffic importance. Experimental results show that Q-PR becomes a routing policy that, as a function of the message importance, achieves a trade-off among the expected number of retransmissions (ETX), the successful delivery rate and the network lifetime.

In the point of epistemology,.when study the samples, we always focus on the sample set, so nothing can be fabricated, in other words, if we only have a few samples, we can get limited knowledge after learning them, then it is impossible to distinguish every unknown situation. To get the principle which is close to the sample as much as possible, this paper puts forward the least covering principle of machine learning, which is the aim of the covering algorithm of multi-layered feedforward neural network; it also makes a study of the properties of least covering, then brings forward a geometry algorithm to get the least covering that is based on this; at last it gives the solving process of least covering using the programming method.

RELEVANCE VECTOR MACHINE REGRESSION APPLIED TO STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURE HEALTH MONITORING & INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE: STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING & INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure	NOV 13-16, 2007	Vancouver, CANADA	Int Soc Struct Hlth Monitoring Intelligent Infrastruct, ISIS Canada Res Network, FiberSensing, MacDonnell Grp, Micron Opt, SMARTEC SA, Vienna Consulting Engineers, Wardrop Engn			BAYESIAN PROBABILISTIC APPROACH; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; BENCHMARK	A recently-developed Bayesian learning methodology, the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), can identify a regression model based on given training data with the advantages of sparseness (i.e. utilizing only a small number of relevant basis expansion terms by automatically pruning others) and automatic regularization of ill-conditioned problems. In training of the RVM, the probability distribution over the unknown regression model parameters is updated based on given training data by using Bayes' Theorem with a special prior probability distribution called the Automatic-Relevance-Determination prior. RVM uses the same kernel basis expansion as in the popular machine learning methodology, the Support Vector Machine (SVM). However, SVM gives only a single estimate while RVM gives probabilistic predictions and it usually does so with a drastically smaller number of basis terms than occurs in the corresponding SVM for the same regression problem. A preliminary investigation of the applicability of RVM regression to structural health monitoring is made. RVM is used to learn a probabilistic relationship between the structural feature vectors, such as changes in mode shapes and natural frequencies, and corresponding damage index vectors describing the damage state of the structure. A two-step approach to SHM is investigated, in which one trained RVM is used to detect the locations of any damage from dynamic data and another trained RVM is then used to estimate the damage severity at each location. The mathematical procedure for RVM and the results for illustrative examples are presented. These preliminary results suggest that RVM is worthy of further investigation as a data processing tool for structural health monitoring.

Several high-throughput techniques are employed to decipher complete interaction network of a cell and to understand its biology. However, experimental techniques are flawed by the large amount of noise and are limited by the lack of coverage. Computational techniques are therefore sought to predict genome-wide protein-protein interactions. In silica approaches mainly use one or the other genome-context methods to identify the interacting protein pairs. Machine learning algorithms trained on physicochemical characteristics of the proteins have also been used to determine interacting partners. In this work, we have used combined genome context methods as data features to train machine learning algorithms. We observed through several numerical experiments that NN performs better than SVMs on a known dataset. We also aim to predict genome wide protein interaction network for different organism using the best model and efficient algorithm.

We study the spatial locality features of large-scale, possibly infinite-dimensional, quadratic programming (QP) problems with linear inequality constraints. Examples of such problems include receding horizon control of spatially distributed linear systems with input and state constraints, optimal estimation of a parameter based on data collected in a sensor network, manifold learning of a large set of data in machine learning, etc. We propose a new approach for analysis of large-scale QP problems by blending tools from duality theory with operator theory. The class of spatially decaying matrices is introduced to capture couplings between optimization variables in the cost function and constraints. We show that the optimal solution of a large-scale convex QP is piece-wise affine- represented as convolution sums. More importantly, we prove that the kernel of each convolution sum decays in the spatial domain at a rate proportional to the inverse of the corresponding coupling function of the optimization problem. Simulations results are provided to verify our theoretical results.

Several machine learning related methods, such as Bayesian networks and decision trees, have been proposed to deal with this difficult problem, but rarely a systematic comparison between different algorithms has been performed. In this work, we critically evaluate the application of multiple linear regression, SVMs, decision trees and Bayesian networks to reconstruct the budding yeast cell cycle network. The performance of these methods is assessed by comparing the topology of the reconstructed models to a validation network. This validation network is defined a priori and each interaction is specified by at least one publication. We also investigate the quality of the network reconstruction if a varying amount of gene regulatory dependencies is provided a priori.

Therefore, in this paper we propose an "inverse" approach: Starting from a priori specified network topologies, we identify those parts of the network which are relevant for the gene expression data at hand. For this purpose, we employ linear ridge regression to predict the expression level of a given gene from its relevant regulators with high reliability. Calculated statistical significances of the resulting network topologies reveal that slight modifications of the pruned regulatory network enable an additional substantial improvement.

The first is classification between normal and abnormal cases and then, discrimination between benign and malignant in cancerous cases. Our proposed method extracts textural and statistical descriptive features that are fed to a learning engine based on the use of Support Vector Machine learning framework to categorize them. The obtained results show excellent accuracy in both classification problems, that proves the appropriate combination of our features and selecting powerful classifier i.e. Support Vector Machine leads us to a brilliant outcome.

It makes use of collective intelligence extracted from Web 2.0 collaborative tagging as well as word semantics to learn how to predict the best set of tags to use, using a hybrid artificial neural network (ANN). The use of "tags" has recently become very popular as a mean of annotating and organizing everything on the web, from photos, videos and music to blogs. Unfortunately, tagging is a manual process and limited to the users' own knowledge and experience. There may be more accurate or popular tags to describe the same content. Collaborative tagging is a recent technology that creates collective intelligence by observing how different users tag similar content. Our research makes use of this collective intelligence to automatically generate tag suggestions to blog authors based on the semantic content of blog entries.

The activities that are performed within Tesys [1] e-Learning platform require sometimes heavy data traffic between platform itself and users. That is why, within the platform there was implemented a data traffic monitoring mechanism at byte level and at activity level. The levels of data traffic and performed activities are monitored and constitute the raw data within the analysis process. The analysis process uses state of the art machine learning algorithms and dynamic data structures in order to produce knowledge. This expertise is further used within the platform to cache delivered data, using the principle of temporal locality of data. Experiments showed the factors that influence the response times are: granularity of traffic monitoring, employed learning algorithm and the data structure used for caching. The results are promising in the way that after prototype implementation of analysis process in the form of an Expertise Module, the response time decreased. The main advantage of Expertise Module is that it virtually introduces insignificant delays since all analysis is performed off-line..

Within such an Educational Network there are issues like: low reliability, unacceptable time response or bad resource management. The usual protocol between clients (users) and server (the e-Learning platform itself) is HTTP. This stateless protocol uses only request/response type interactions between clients and server. For improvement of afore mentioned issues there was built a module that gives the "intelligent" character of the Educational Network. This module records user performed actions, levels of data traffic and other performed activities in an attempt to solve or improve presented issues. The enforced mechanisms use state of the art machine learning algorithms, mathematical modeling and dynamic structures management, giving thus the intelligent character of the educational network.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of disambiguating person names within web pages and scientific documents. We present an efficient and effective two-stage approach to disambiguate names. lit the first stage, two novel topic-based models are proposed by extending two hierarchical Bayesian text models, namely Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our models explicitly introduce a new variable for persons and learn the distribution of topics with regard to persons and words. After learning an initial model, the topic distributions are treated as feature sets and names are disambiguated by leveraging a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. Experiments on web data and scientific documents from CiteSeer indicate that our approach consistently outperforms other unsupervised learning methods such as spectral clustering and DBSCAN clustering and could be extended to other research fields. We empirically addressed the issue of scalability by disambiguating authors in over 750,000 papers from the entire CiteSeer dataset.	[Song, Yang; Li, Jia; Giles, C.

Manually classifying the large volume of patents and patent applications managed by patent offices is a labor-intensive task. Many previous studies have employed patent contents for patent classification with the aim of automating this process. In this research we propose to use patent citation information, especially the citation network structure information, to address the patent classification problem. We adopt a kernel-based approach and design kernel functions to capture content information and various citation-related information in patents. These kernels' performances are evaluated on a testbed of patents related to nanotechnology.

The information about its conformation can provide essential information for drug design and protein engineering. While there are over a million known protein sequences, only a limited number of protein structures are experimentally determined. Hence, prediction of protein structures from protein sequences using computer programs is an important step to unveil proteins' three dimensional conformation and functions. As a result, prediction of protein structures has profound theoretical and practical influence over biological study. The explanation of how a decision is made during prediction is also important for improving protein structure prediction and guiding the "wet experiments". In this talk, we will show how to use machine learning methods to improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction and to interpret prediction results. We will report our research on using neural networks, Support Vector Machines combined with Decision Tree and Association Rule for protein structure prediction, rule extraction and prediction interpretation. Evaluation and comparisons of various prediction and rule extraction systems will be presented and future research direction in this area will also be identified.

We are investigating the possibility of detecting microscopic disease using machine learning approaches based on features derived from gene expression levels and metabolic profiles. We use immunochemistry and QRT-PCR to measure the gene expression profiles from a number of antigens such as cyclin E, P27(KIP1), FHIT, Ki-67, PCNA, Bax, Bcl-2. P53, Fas, FasL and hTERT in several particular types of neuroendocrine tumors such as pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas; and the adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), adenomas (ACA), and hyperplasia (ACH) in Cushing's syndrome. We provide statistical evidence that, higher expression levels of hTERT, PCNA and Ki67 etc. are associated with a,higher risk that the tumors are malignant or borderline, as opposed to benign. We also investigated whether higher expression levels of the P27(KIP1) and FHIT etc. are associated with a decreased risk of adrenomedullary tumors. While no significant difference was found between cell-arrest antigens such as P27(KIP1) for malignant, borderline, and benign tumors, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such antigens in normal adrenal medulla samples and in adrenomedullary tumors.

Rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is the key to avoiding disease outbreaks and costly product recalls associated with food-borne pathogens. Automated identification of pathogens using scatter patterns of bacterial colonies is a promising technique that uses image processing and machine learning approaches to extract features from forward-scatter patterns produced by irradiating bacterial colonies with red laser light. The feature vector used for this approach can consist of hundreds of features, and a sufficiently large number of training images is required for accurate classification. As most feature extraction algorithms have high computational cost, the feature extraction step becomes the bottleneck in the whole processing pipeline. Computational grid technologies provide a promising and economical solution to this problem. In this work we report the implementation of the laser-scatter-analysis technique on a computational grid. A set of more than 2000 images was used for training of classifiers. The invariant form of Zernike moments up to order 20, radial Chebyshev moments, and Haralick features were extracted. Linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine classifiers were used for classification. We report speed-ups achieved and the scalabitity of this approach for large sets of images and for higher-order moments. Laser-scatter-analysis technique combined with computational grid technology offers a feasible and economic solution for rapid and accurate detection and classification of bacterial contamination.

Cellular levels of lipids are tightly regulated, and alterations in lipid metabolism can cause various human diseases such as inflammation, cancer and neurological disorders. Here, we present a method that takes an amino acid sequence as the only input and predicts lipid-interacting residues using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Protein sequence datasets with known lipid-interacting residues were chosen from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). SVM classifiers were then constructed using data instances encoded with three sequence features. The results suggest that lipid-interacting residues can be predicted at 52.78% sensitivity and 70.84% specificity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that utilizes a machine learning approach to predict lipid-interacting residues based on amino acid sequence data. Our study provides useful information for understanding protein-lipid interactions, and may lead to advances in drug discovery.

Comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms requires reliable procedures for accurately assessing the performance (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) of the resulting predictive classifiers. The difficulty of this task is compounded by the use of different data selection and evaluation procedures and in some cases, even different definitions for the same performance measures. We explore the problem of assessing the performance of predictive classifiers trained on macromolecular sequence data, with an emphasis on cross-validation and data selection methods. Specifically, we compare sequence-based and window-based cross-validation procedures on three sequence-based prediction tasks: identification of glycosylation sites, RNA-Protein interface residues, and Protein-Protein interface residues from amino acid sequence. Our experiments with two representative classifiers (Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) show that sequence-based and windows-based cross-validation procedures and data selection methods can yield different estimates of commonly used performance measures such as accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. We argue that the performance estimates obtained using sequence-based cross-validation provide more realistic estimates of performance than those obtained using window-based cross-validation.

For the function prediction and classification of enzymes, many methods based on sequence similarity to detect similar proteins have been developed. However, these methods often miscarry in the case of the absence of similar sequences or poor similarity among proteins. Therefore, many researchers have been developing alternative approaches that assign function from protein features without consideration of sequence similarity. In this paper, we propose a method of sequence-driven feature extraction and enzyme functional classification using only the features of protein sequence, excluding predicted secondary structures and annotation information of protein databases. Our experimental results demonstrate that the enzyme classification based on the Chi-Squared ranking method among various attribute selection methods is efficient. Also, we find that amino acid composition of specific enzyme differs from composition of other enzymes.

This work focuses on helping to understand the molecular basis of catalysis by exploring the nature of catalytic residues, their environment and characteristic properties in a large data set of enzyme structures and using this information to predict enzyme structures' active sites. A machine learning approach that performs feature extraction, clustering and classification on a protein structure data set is proposed. 6,376 residues directly involved in enzyme catalysis, present in more than 800 proteins structures in the PDB were analyzed. Feature extraction provided a description of critical features for each catalytic residue, which were consistent with prior knowledge about them. Results from k-fold-cross-validation for classification showed more than 80% accuracy. Complete enzymes were scanned using these classifiers to locate catalytic residues.

The general approach is to use the profile hidden Markov models of protein domains and the known interactions between domains to train a support vector machine. Proteins are characterized by the vectors of fisher scores that are obtained from comparing the protein sequences to the hidden Markov model for a given domain. Protein pairs, represented by concatenation of their respective fisher score vectors, are classified as interacting partners and non interacting partners by a trained SVM. By selecting the fisher scores based on a profile hidden Markov model that differentiates the interaction sites from other residues within the domain, we demonstrated that the prediction accuracy was significantly improved, as measured in a series of cross validation experiments.

However, these tests are expensive and time-consuming, and phenotyping has been performed on only a fraction of the nearly 400 distinct patient-derived protease mutants. We employed a computational mutagenesis methodology, incorporating both sequence and structure information, to generate a feature vector representation for each of the isolated protease mutants. Training sets were prepared for seven protease inhibitors, each consisting of protease mutants with known phenotypes. Four machine-learning algorithms were implemented, and random forest performed best at distinguishing between sensitive/resistant mutants based on area under the ROC curve (0.81 - 0.92). Trained models were used to make predictions about recently assayed protease mutants and displayed 83% agreement with the experimental data. The results suggest that susceptibility of unassayed protease mutants to each inhibitor can be reliably predicted.

A limited donor supply has resulted in 4000 patients on the waiting list. Currently, 10-20% of donor organs are deemed suitable under the selection criteria of which 15-25% fails due to primary graft dysfunction (PGD). In this study, we attempt to further our understanding of PGD by observing the changes in gene expression across donor lungs that developed PGD versus those that did not. Our second goal is to use a machine learning tool - support vector machine (SVM), to distinguish unsuitable donor lungs from suitable donor lungs, based on the gene expression data. Classification results for distinguishing suitable and unsuitable lungs for transplantation using a SVM were promising. This is the first such attempt to use human lungs used for transplantation and combine the identification of a molecular signature for PGD, with machine learning methods for donor lung prediction.

Several approaches have been used to address the problem of predicting PPI. Some of them are based on biological features extracted from a protein sequence (such as, amino acid composition, GO terms, etc.); others use relational and structural features extracted from the PPI network, which can be represented as a graph. Our approach falls in the second category. We adapt a general approach to graph feature extraction that has previously been applied to collaborative recommendation of friends in social networks. Several structural features are identified based on the PPI graph and used to learn classifiers for predicting new interactions. Two datasets containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI are used to test the proposed approach. Both these datasets were assembled from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP). We assembled the first data set directly from DIP in April 2006, while the second data set has been used in previous studies, thus making it easy to compare our approach with previous approaches. Several classifiers are trained using the structural features extracted from the interactions graph. The results show good performance (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), proving that the structural features are highly predictive with respect to PPI.	[Paradesi, Martin S.

While other studies have focused on analyzing the frequency of amino acid-base contacts, this study here attempts to discover the structural and physicochemical features of proteins that determine the specificity of amino acid-base contacts. For each amino acid that contacts with DNA, we attempt to predict the type of bases (purines or pyrimidines) that it contacts. We extract 8 structural and physicochemical features from proteins and use a bottom-up approach to search for the combination of features that can be used to predict the specificity of amino acid-base contacts. In the end, 4 features are selected. Using these features, a support vector machine method can achieve 67.1% accuracy with 0329 MCC in predicting the type of base (purines or pyrimidines) that an amino acid contacts. Analyzing the selected features will provide insights into the "recognition code" of protein-DNA interaction.

The results indicate that selection of a classifier depends upon the specific PPI classification problem. Feature integration and encoding methods proposed significantly impact the predictive performance of the classifiers.

These domains can have important structural or functional properties. When a protein's sequence, but not structure, is known, being able to predict the division of the sequence into its domains may ease structural or functional analysis of the protein. However, predicting domain boundaries from sequence is still an open problem. This research uses machine learning approaches to the prediction problem. It starts with several standard methods - naive Bayes, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. The results of these methods are combined using a mixture of experts (MoE) approach that gives the final boundary predictions. We show both a simple MoE approach, and one using context in the form of a window of predictions from the machine learning methods. Both MoE methods, especially the windowed MoE, show greatly increased predictive performance relative to the individual machine learning predictors.

Among the SVM variants, least-squares SVMs have gained increased attention recently due to the computational benefits they usually entail. Although considered as high-performance models, it is consensual that the applicability of these vector machines depends very much on a proper choice of some control parameters. In this paper, we present a sensitivity analysis study contrasting the performance profiles exhibited by standard and least-squares SVM classifiers with respect to the calibration of the kernel parameter value alone. The results achieved with simulations involving seven datasets indicate that the performance profiles are usually qualitatively similar for the two types of vector machines, both presenting kernel parameter values clearly associated with a better performance, and that the choice of the kernel function seems to be more critical than that of its parameter value.

Given a training set which generally is described as a set of instances, each of them represented as a vector of feature-value pairs and an associated class, a feature selection method tries to identify features that are relevant for describing the concept embedded in the training set. The Focus algorithm is a very popular feature subset approach used in discrete data; its version for continuous data is known as C-Focus. The selection process implemented by Focus searches for the smallest feature subset that does not produce inconsistency in the training set. Due to its search mechanism, however, the use of the Focus (or C-Focus) becomes restrictive when the number of features is very large. This paper proposes a heuristic search method to be used by Focus (C-Focus), aiming at improving its performance. Empirical results of a system implementing C-Focus with the new search strategy (C-Focus-3) show that the proposed heuristic performs very well when the relevant subset of features has more than half of the number of features present in the original training set.

An algorithm has been built to allow fully automatic mid-air collision, ground, terrain or building avoidance, without any intervention from the pilot. Additionally, the algorithm allows fully automatic navigation. These capabilities have been tested through simulation. We plan to use this software with a flight simulator. The software will take the pilot's place in these tests. This way the software will be evaluated in a similar way to how pilots learn and are assessed.

In order to improve the efficiency of grid service selection, a new approach based on improved reinforcement Q-learning for dynamic grid service selection is proposed The environment of Grid service selection is a nondeterministic Markov decision processes (MDPs), and the study of grid service selection learning method is a challenge to current reinforcement learning which is based on MDPs. This paper proposes a correlative improved method for dynamic grid service selection. The experiment results show that the novel method is more effective in some aspects than traditional ones. Therefore it provides a good solution to select grid service.

Also, they are used to identify a set of SNPs relevant to the disease. In addition, we apply backtracking technique to couple of feature selection algorithms, forward selection and backward elimination, and show that this technique is beneficial to find the better solutions by experiments. The experimental results show that decision rule is able to distinguish chronic hepatitis from normal with the maximum accuracy of 73.20%, whereas SVM is with 67.53% and decision tree is with 72.68%. It is also shown that decision tree and decision rule are potential tools to predict the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis from SNP data.

Lots of different approaches have been introduced to detect regulator-target pairs using whole expression data. In this paper, we present a simple, but efficient method for detecting the regulator-target pairs based on an alignment method. Comparing to previous work based on event-string comparison approach, the basic idea of our algorithm is different in that we have applied a parametric optimization for alignment scoring matrix by using a simple machine learning procedure. As a result, we get a sensitivity and a specificity that is 10% higher than the recent work by Kwon[1].

Improving training speed of Support Vector Machines by creating exploitable trends of Lagrangian variables: an application to DNA splice site detection	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FRONTIERS IN THE CONVERGENCE OF BIOSCIENCE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Frontiers in the Convergence of Bioscience and Information Technologies	OCT 11-13, 2007	Cheju Isl, SOUTH KOREA				ALGORITHM	Support Vector Machines are state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that can be used for classification problems such as DNA splice site identification. However, the large number of samples in biological data sets can often lead to slow training speed. The training speed can be improved by removing non-support vectors prior to training. This paper proposes a method to predict non-support vectors with high accuracy by the use of strict-constrained gradient ascent optimisation. Unlike other data pre-selection methods, the proposed gradient based method is itself a training algorithm for SVM, and is also very simple to implement. Experiments with comparable results are conducted on a DNA splice-site detection problem. Results show significant speed improvements over other algorithms. The relationship between speed improvement and cache memory size is also exploited. Generalisation capability of the proposed algorithm is also shown to be better than some other reformulated SVMs.	[Li, Jason; Halgamuge, Saman K.] Univ Melbourne, DMME, Dynam Syst & Control Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia	Li, J (reprint author), Univ Melbourne, DMME, Dynam Syst & Control Grp, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.	j.li5@pgrad.unimelb.edu.au	Halgamuge, Saman/A-8154-2008	Halgamuge, Saman/0000-0002-2536-4930			Brown MPS, 2000, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V97, P262, DOI 10.1073/pnas.97.1.262; CAMPBELL C, 1998, SIMPLE LEARNING ALGO; Cristianini N., 2000, INTRO SUPPORT VECTOR; Dong JX, 2003, INT J PATTERN RECOGN, V17, P367, DOI 10.1142/S0218001403002423; FRIESS T, 1998, MACH LEARN P 15 INT; HASAN AA, 2003, P INT C AC SPEECH SI, V2, P763; Joachims T., 1998, ADV KERNEL METHODS S; KECMAN V, 2003, P 11 EUR S ART NEUR; Keerthi SS, 2001, NEURAL COMPUT, V13, P637, DOI 10.1162/089976601300014493; LIN CJ, 2001, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V12; Lin KM, 2003, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V14, P1449, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2003.820828; LIU S, 2002, P 9 INT C NEUR INF P, V2, P760; Michie D, 1994, MACHINE LEARNING; Platt J., 1998, ADV KERNEL METHODS S; Suykens JAK, 1999, NEURAL PROCESS LETT, V9, P293, DOI 10.1023/A:1018628609742; Vapnik VN, 1998, STAT LEARNING THEORY; WANG Z, 2004, P HUM VIS EL IM, V9, P5292; Zhao HK, 1998, J COMPUT PHYS, V143, P495, DOI 10.1006/jcph.1997.5810	18	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-2999-8				2007							230	233		10.1109/FBIT.2007.56		4	Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering, Biomedical	Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering	BHT66	WOS:000256289300041

These techniques can either be manually performed by an expert, or automated using software algorithms (Machine Learning). However some domains (such as the field of lung function testing) contain volumes of data too vast for effective manual analysis, and require background knowledge too complex for Machine Learning algorithms. This study examines how the Multiple Classification Ripple-Down Rules (MCRDR) Knowledge Acquisition process can be adapted to develop a new Knowledge Discovery method, Exposed MCRDR. A prototype system was developed and tested in the domain of lung function. Preliminary results suggest that the EMCRDR method can be successfully applied to efficiently discover new knowledge in a complex domain. The study also reveals many potential areas of study and development for the MCRDR method, and Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery methods in general.

The solution to this problem is partially solved by considering considering a model of perception that is at the level of classes in a partition defined by a particular equivalence relation in an approximation space. This form of perception provides a basis for adaptive learning that has surprising acuity. Viewing approximation spaces as the formal counterpart of perception was suggested by Ewa Orlowska in 1982. This view of perception grew out the discovery of rough sets by Zdzislaw Pawlak during the early 1980s. The particular model of perception that underlies biologically-inspired learning is based on a near set approach, which considers classes of organisms with similar behaviours. In this paper, the focus is on learning by tropical fish called glowlight tetra (Hemigarmmus erythrozonus). Ethology (study of the comparative behaviour of organisms), in particular, provides a basis for the design of an artificial ecosystem useful in simulating the behaviour of fish. The contribution of this paper is a complete framework for an ethology-based study of adaptive learning defined in the context of nearness approximation spaces.

Recently; it has been noted that the use of machine learning classifiers for decoding cognitive states directly from fMRI data is a powerful technique that enables researchers to make predictions about the mental state of a subject. In this paper we explore some of the fundamental questions fMRI-decoding raises by applying and comparing different machine learning techniques and feature selection methods to the problem of classifying the instantaneous cognitive state of a person based on fMRI data. In particular, we present successful case studies of induced classifiers which accurately discriminate between cognitive states produced by different stimuli. We show how classifiers can be used as confirmatory tools allowing the testing of competing hypothesis about the structure in the data, and show that it is possible to train successful classifiers without prior anatomical knowledge and using only a very small number of features.

The data-driven non-parametric Machine Learning modeling methods are applied to this task. Digital Elevation Model is extensively used in the modeling. Terrain characteristics calculated from DEM are used as the inputs of the mapping methods. The relevant information on the wind speed in complex alpine terrain is learned from data, and the use of numerous heuristics is avoided. The available meteorological information is obtained from 110 stations of Swiss meteorological monitoring network. Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine are used for the modeling. The basic problem which are considered in the paper are: spatial classification of the zones where the mean annual wind speed exceeds 5 m/s, spatial regression of the mean annual wind speed. Another case study deals with simultaneous modeling of the mean daily wind speed and direction, resulting in a data-driven wind field model.

Many learning algorithms have been shown to be successful for various kinds of learning scenarios. Basically they all generate a single network from data, which is then used for classification purposes and possible domain understanding. In this paper we propose a simple method for inferring a model consisting of several Bayesian networks, each one representing data of one class. The data is divided into class subsets and from each subset a separate Bayesian network is learnt. Classification is done using prior and posterior probability distribution information in all networks. We thoroughly tested the proposed method on synthetic data and several repository datasets and compared it to other machine learning methods, to prove its effectiveness. We argue that with smaller modifications, the method can be used for learning from censored survival domains.

More concretely, it proposes a learning pipeline process that generates the classification function within the optical property function used for rendering. Briefly, this pipeline starts with a data acquisition and selection task, it is followed by a feature extraction process, to be ended with sequence of supervised learning steps. Learning comprises Gentle Boost and CRF (Conditional Random Fields) classifiers. The process is evaluated in terms of accuracy and overlap metrics so that we can measure how performance increases along the whole pipeline process. Empirical results confirm that, even though the classification of high-resolution computerized tomography volume data poses a challenging problem for single-run classifiers, it can be significantly improved by subsequent learning steps and refinements.

KAAR has theoretical advantages over KRR since a bound on its square loss for the worst case is known that does not hold for KRR. This bound does not make any assumptions about the underlying probability distribution of the data. In practice, however, KAAR performs better only when the data is heavily corrupted by noise or has severe outliers. This is due to the fact that KAAR is similar to KRR but with some fairly strong extra regularisation. In this paper we develop KAAR in such a way as to make it practical for use on real world data. This is achieved by controlling the amount of extra regularisation. Empirical results (including results on the well known Boston Housing dataset) suggest that in general our new methods perform as well as or better than KRR, KAAR and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in terms of the square loss they suffer.

If lack of domain experts prevents the use of highly informative attributes, patterns are hard to uncover due to complex attribute interactions. Feature construction intends to create new features that encapsulate and highlight the hidden interactions. However, its success often relies on the appropriateness of a given set of algebraic operators for expressing the relevant combination of attributes in the current domain. When lacking prior knowledge of appropriate operators, systems use non-algebraic feature construction techniques to extract features directly from training data. The paper analyzes two such systems, MFE2/GA and HINT, concluding that their different design components suggest complementary functionalities. This is supported by an empirical system comparison using synthetic and real-world data where attribute interaction prevails.

Decision tree based and support vector machine based classification methods have been applied to the wheel inspection data analysis. A variation of the bagging ensemble approach is developed to improve the classification accuracy. The results of these methods achieve an identification accuracy of 80%. Analysis of the rules and models derived, as well as comparisons of the classification results obtained using the two base classification approaches are presented.

One of them is the RPNI algorithm that merges pairs of states of the prefix tree acceptor of the positive samples in a fixed order assuring consistency of the resulting automaton. The resulting automaton need not be the optimal one. By prohibiting some merges done by the original RPNI algorithm it is possible to get a better automaton. We propose a new method of searching pairs of states which should not be merged using genetic algorithms and a random walk.

A framework for generating data to simulate changing environments	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IASTED INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	IASTED International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Applications	FEB 12-14, 2007	Innsbruck, AUSTRIA	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev		machine learning; changing environments; concept drift; population drift; artificial data; simulated data		A fundamental assumption often made in supervised classification is that the problem is static, i.e. the description of the classes does not change with time. However many practical classification tasks involve changing environments. Thus designing and testing classifiers for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. A number of benchmark data sets are available for static classification tasks. For example, the UCI machine learning repository is extensively used by researchers to compare algorithms across various domains. No such benchmark datasets are available for changing environments. Also, while generating data for static environments is relatively straightforward, this is not so for changing environments. The reason is that an infinite amount of changes can be simulated, and it is difficult to define which ones will be realistic and hence useful. In this paper we propose a general framework for generating data to simulate changing environments. The paper gives illustrations of how the framework encompasses various types of changes observed in real data and also how the two most popular simulation models (STAGGER and moving hyperplane) are represented within.

If the unknown to be estimated is categorical or discrete, the problem is one of classification. Algorithms for supervised learning are useful tools in many areas of agriculture, medicine, and engineering, including prediction of malignant cancer, document analysis, and speech recognition. In general, Support Vector Machine algorithms have been successful in classification problems, but they have high computational complexity. In this paper, we present the Hyperplane Algorithm. It and two other related algorithms form an ensemble classifier for supervised classification. The Hyperplane Algorithm is reminiscent of a support vector machine but is low in computational complexity. It also has several other advantages compared to Support Vector Machines. Results for five real-life datasets results are shown.	Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA	Vance, D (reprint author), Univ Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.

It is interesting to discover exceptions, as they challenge the existing knowledge and often lead to the growth of knowledge in new directions. Discovering exceptions from voluminous data sets still remains a great challenge. In Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), it is also significant to extract the knowledge in a form that is flexible and efficient enough for approximate reasoning. A Censored Production Rule (CPR) is a special kind of knowledge structure that is represented as an augmented production rule of the form: If P Then D Unless C, where C (Censor) is an exception to rule. If P Then D part of CPR holds frequently while Unless C part holds rarely. Discovery of CPRs not only provides a computational mechanism to exhibit variable precision logic but also results in the discovery of a set of rules of considerably reduced size. In this paper, a Parallel Genetic Algorithm approach is suggested for automated discovery of Censored Production Rules. The parallel Genetic Algorithm involves both data and control parallelism. A fitness function that incorporates the constraints of CPRs, is proposed. The experimental results establish the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Based on our experiments result on the question classification task, we choose to use SVM as the machine learning algorithm. Similar with ordinary QA systems, we divide our system into three subcomponents: question classifier, passage retriever and answer finder. The SVM algorithm is employed in the question classifier and answer finder modules. To overcome the language resource poorness problem of Indonesian language, we introduce a bi-gram frequency attribute extracted from a downloaded newspaper corpus. The comparison among attribute combination is shown in our question classifier experiment. The West shows that the question shallow parser result attribute joined with bi-gram frequency attribute gives significant improvement compared to the baseline (bag of words). Our question classifier achieves 96% accuracy. We also compare some attribute combinations in the answer finder module. We find that the join attribute between the expected answer type (EAT) and the attributes of the question classifier gives higher MRR score than using only the EAT attribute or only the attribute of the question classifiers. Our QA system achieves MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) of 0.52 for exact answers.

This research focuses on Thai verb sense disambiguation. Many approaches have been employed to resolve the word sense ambiguity with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Our research focuses on the corpus-based approach that employs a supervised machine leaming method for disambiguation. The machine leaming method has the ability of selecting the suitable feature. In order to find the best feature set for resolving Thai word sense ambiguity, our method uses characteristics of the words co-occur with the ambiguous word in sentences extracted from Thai corpus for determining sense of the ambiguous word. The ambiguous words are evaluated with 30 feature sets under "word" "part of speech (POS)" and "semantic concept (SM)" features. The result shows that "word & SM" feature set gives the best result as the best feature set of sense indicator and the accuracy rate is approximately 90-96%.

Researchers have investigated various statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms until now but most of them applied their models to the different datasets which are not public or used different criteria to decide the best predictor model. Artificial Immune Recognition System is a supervised learning algorithm which has been proposed in 2001 for the classification problems and its performance for UCI datasets (University of California machine learning repository) is remarkable. In this paper, we propose a novel software defect prediction model by applying Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) along with the Correlation-Based Feature Selection (CFS) technique. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we apply it to the five NASA public defect datasets and compute G-mean1, G-mean2 and F-measure values to discuss the effectiveness of the model. Experimental results show that AIRS has a great potential for software defect prediction and AIRS along with CFS technique provides relatively better prediction for large scale projects which consist of many modules.

Among the years, several tools have been designed that show decent performances. Of course, grammatical checkers may improve corrections of texts, nevertheless, this requires large resources. We think that basic spell checking may be improved (a step towards) using the Web as a corpus and taking into account the context of words that are identified as potential misspellings. We propose to use the Google search engine and some machine learning techniques, in order to design a flexible and dynamic spell checker that may evolve among the time with new linguistic features.

We implemented a machine transliteration system and generated Chinese, Japanese, and Korean transliteration hypotheses for given English words. Then, we mined the Web for features relevant to validating transliteration hypotheses. Finally we validated transliteration hypotheses using machine learning algorithms learned with the mined features. Comparing Web counts with our Web mining technique, our proposed method consistently performed better than systems based on Web counts, regardless of the language.

The emotion classifiers are trained at the sentence level and applied to the, document level. Our methods also determine an emotion category by taking the context of a sentence into account. Experiments show that CRF classifiers outperform SVM classifiers. When applying emotion classification to a blog at the document level, the emotion of the last sentence in a document plays an important role in determining the overall emotion.

Two main problems in applying some machine learning techniques for Web mining are. the dynamic and ever-changing nature of Web data and the sheer size of possible dimensions that this data could portray. One such technique, self-organizing maps (SOMs), have been enhanced to deal with these two problems individually. The growing hierarchical self-organizing map can adapt to the dynamic data present on the Web by changing its topology according to the amount of change in input size. In addition, it reduces local dimensionality by splitting features into levels. We extend this model by including bidirectional update propagation over the levels of the hierarchy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach with a Web-based news coverage example.

Manual construction of taxonomies is a time-consuming and cumbersome task. Recently many researchers have focused on automatic taxonomy learning, but still quality of generated taxonomies is not satisfactory. In this paper we have proposed a new compound similarity measure. This measure is based on both knowledge poor and knowledge rich approaches to find word similarity. We also used Machine Learning Technique (Neural Network model) for combination of several similarity methods. We have compared our method with simple syntactic similarity measure. Our measure considerably improves the precision and recall of automatic generated taxonomies.

Traditional data and information retrieval systems that support the current web are no longer adequate for knowledge seeking tasks. Knowledge retrieval systems will be the next generation of retrieval system serving those purposes. Basic issues of knowledge retrieval systems are examined and a conceptual framework of such systems is proposed. Theories and Technologies such as theory of knowledge, machine learning and knowledge discovery, psychology, logic and inference, linguistics, etc. are briefly mentioned for the implementation of knowledge retrieval systems. Two applications of knowledge retrieval in rough sets and biomedical domains are presented.

Right setting parameters are very crucial to learning results and generalization ability of SVM. In this paper, parameters selection is regarded as a compound optimization problem and a modified differential evolution (MDE) algorithm is applied to search the optimal parameters. The modified differential evolution adopts a time-varying crossover probability strategy, which can improve the global convergence ability and robustness of the algorithm. Various examples are simulated and the experiment results demonstrate that this proposed approach has better approximation performance than other approaches.

Firstly, a corpus of 1539 manually labeled web pages was prepared. Secondly, 502 genre features were selected based on the literature and the observation of the corpus. Thirdly, these features were extracted from the corpus to obtain a data set. Finally, two machine learning algorithms, one for induction of decision trees (J48) and one ensemble algorithm (bagging), were trained and tested on the data set. The ensemble algorithm achieved on average 17% better precision and 1.6% better accuracy, but slightly worse recall; F-measure did not vary significantly. The results indicate that classification by genre could be a useful addition to search engines.

A new challenge to feature selection is the so-called "small labeled-sample problem" in which labeled data is small and unlabeled data is large. The paucity of labeled instances provides insufficient information about the structure of the target concept, and can cause supervised feature selection algorithms to fail. Unsupervised feature selection algorithms can work without labeled data. However, these algorithms ignore label information, which may lead to performance deterioration. In this work, we propose to use both (small) labeled and (large) unlabeled data in feature selection, which is a topic has not yet been addressed in feature selection research. We present a semi-supervised feature selection, algorithm based on spectral analysis. The algorithm exploits both labeled and unlabeled data through a regularization framework, which provides an effective way to address the "small labeled-sample" problem. Experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of our approach and confirmed that small labeled samples can help feature selection with unlabeled data.

Concept algebra is an abstract mathematical structure for the formal treatment of concepts and their algebraic relations, operations, and associative rules for composing complex concepts, which provides a denotational mathernatic means for knowledge system representation and manipulation. This paper presents a method that shows how the theory of concept algebra is implemented and simulated using typical computers. A visualized knowledge representation tool for concept algebra is developed, which enables machines learn concepts and knowledge autonomously. Nine forms of concept association operations are implemented in the tool to rigorously manipulate knowledge by concept networks. The knowledge representation tool is capable to present concepts and knowledge systems in multiple ways, in order to visualize concept networks by computer simulations.

The neural informatics foundations of learning, particularly the Hierarchical Neural Cluster (HNC) model and the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model, are explored. The taxonomy and theory of learning are described based on Concept Algebra. The mathematical models of learning are systematically established for the categories of the transitive, objective, and complex learning. On the basis of the fundamental theories of learning, the cognitive processes of learning are formally described using Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA). The theoretical framework established in this work can be applied to both human and machine learning systems.

This paper presents an autonomic learning system known as the AutoLearner. Mimics of knowledge organization, updating, and navigation inside the brain are formally modeled according to the OAR model using concept algebra and RTPA. A machine learning system and a cognitive simulator are developed to visualize interactions between thinking, learning, and the internal knowledge representation. A case study is presented to demonstrate the design and implementation of the AutoLearner system.

Financial data was obtained from Diana, a large database containing-financial statements of French companies. Classification accuracy is evaluated with Artificial Neural Networks, TreeNet, Random Forests and Liner Genetic Programs (LGPs). LGPs have the best performance accuracy in both balanced data and unbalanced dataset. Our results demonstrate the potential of using learning machines in solving important economics problems such as financial distress classification. Feature selection is as important for financial distress classification as;it is for many other problems. We present several feature selection methods for financial distress classification. It is demonstrated that, with appropriately chosen features, financial health of a company can be detected. Experiments on Diana dataset have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of this criterion.

Though the state of the art focuses on data analysis, little is done in the sense of prediction. In this paper, we describe a machine learning system for traffic flow management and control for a prediction of traffic flow problem. This new algorithm is obtained by combining Random Forests algorithm into Adaboost algorithm as a weak learner. We show that our algorithm performs relatively well on real data, and enables, according to the Traffic Flow Evaluation model, to estimate and predict whether there is congestion or not at a given time on road intersections.

They are collaboratively created across the Web and used to index, search and annotate documents. The vast majority of the ontology based approaches, however, focus on indexing texts at document level. Recently, with the advances in ontological engineering, it became clear that information indexing can largely benefit from the use of general purpose ontologies which aid the indexing of documents at word level. This paper presents a concept indexing algorithm, which adds ontology information to words and phrases and allows full text to be searched, browsed and analyzed at different levels of abstraction. This algorithm uses a general purpose ontology, OntoRo, and an ontologically tagged corpus, OntoCorp, both developed for the purpose of this research. OntoRo and OntoCorp are used in a two-stage supervised machine learning process aimed at generating ontology tagging rules. The first experimental tests show a tagging accuracy of 78.91% which is encouraging in terms of the further improvement of the algorithm.

Currently, popular techniques developed to deal with this task include many preprocessing and learning algorithms, many of which in turn require tuning non-trivial internal parameters. Although partial studies are available, many authors fail to report values of the parameters they use in their experiments, or reasons why these values were used instead of others. The goal of this work then is to create a more thorough comparison of preprocessing parameters and their mutual influence, and report interesting observations and results.

These problems are: time consuming, high cost, high errors percentage and low efficiency and accuracy of the system. The proposed system will investigate and improve the efficiency and accuracy of a simulated robot to choose correct behavior to perform its task. In this paper, machine learning, which uses genetic algorithm, is adopted. This type of machine learning is called genetic-based machine learning in which a distributed classifier system is used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the robot. Consequently, it helps the robot to achieve optimal action.

This study has adopted an experimentation in which participants were exposed to a set of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while their electrical brain activity was recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG). The pictures were already rated in a previous study via the affective rating system Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to assess the three dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance. For each picture, we took the mean of these values for all subjects used in this previous study and associated them to the recorded brainwaves of the participants in our study. Correlation and regression analyses confirmed the hypothesis that brainwave measures could significantly predict emotional dimensions. This can be very useful in the case of impassive, taciturn or disabled learners. Standard classification techniques were used to assess the reliability of the automatic detection of learners' three major dimensions from the brainwaves. We discuss the results and the pertinence of such a method to assess learner's emotions and integrate it into a brainwave-sensing Intelligent Tutoring System.

Major advantage of SVM's over NN is of minimizing a bound on the generalization error of model rather than minimizing a bound on mean square error over the data set as done in NN. Tree Based approach divides the problem into a small number of sub problems to reach at a conclusion. Number of data was created for different parameters of beam to calculate the reinforcement using limit state method for creation of models and validation. The results from this study suggest a remarkably good performance of tree based and SVM's models. Further, this study found that these two techniques work well and even better than Neural Network methods. A comparison of predicted values with actual values suggests a very good correlation coefficient with all four techniques.

Learning Classifier Systems Approach for Automated Discovery of Crisp and Fuzzy Hierarchical Production Rules	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 26, PARTS 1 AND 2, DECEMBER 2007	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	DEC 14-16, 2007	Bangkok, THAILAND	World Acad Sci Engn & Technol		Hierarchical Production Rule; Data Mining; Learning Classifier System; Fuzzy Subsumption Relation; Subsumption matrix; Reinforcement Learning	CENSORED PRODUCTION RULES	This research presents a system for post processing of data that takes mined flat rules as input and discovers crisp as well as fuzzy hierarchical structures using Learning Classifier System approach. Learning Classifier System (LCS) is basically a machine learning technique that combines evolutionary computing, reinforcement learning, supervised or unsupervised learning and heuristics to produce adaptive systems. A LCS learns by interacting with an environment from which it receives feedback in the form of numerical reward. Learning is achieved by trying to maximize the amount of reward received. Crisp description for a concept usually cannot represent human knowledge completely and practically. In the proposed Learning Classifier System initial population is constructed as a random collection of HPR-trees (related production rules) and crisp / fuzzy hierarchies are evolved. A fuzzy subsumption relation is suggested for the proposed system and based on Subsumption Matrix (SM), a suitable fitness function is proposed. Suitable genetic operators are proposed for the chosen chromosome representation method. For implementing reinforcement a suitable reward and punishment scheme is also proposed. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system.

Rough Set Theory (RST) is a mathematical formalism for representing uncertainty that can be considered an extension of the classical set theory. It has been used in many different research areas, including those related to inductive machine learning and reduction of knowledge in knowledge-based systems. One important concept related to RST is that of a rough relation. In this paper we presented the current status of research on applying rough set theory to KDD, which will be helpful for handle the characteristics of real-world databases. The main aim is to show how rough set and rough set analysis can be effectively used to extract knowledge from large databases.

It includes the records for finance, maintenance, inventory, progress reports etc. As the time progresses, the data keep on accumulating and the challenge is to extract the information from this data bank. Knowledge discovery from these large and complex databases is the key problem of this era. Data mining and machine learning techniques are needed which can scale to the size of the problems and can be customized to the application of business. For the development of accurate and required information for particular problem, business analyst needs to develop multidimensional models which give the reliable information so that they can take right decision for particular problem. If the multidimensional model does not possess the advance features, the accuracy cannot be expected. The present work involves the development of a Multidimensional data model incorporating advance features. The criterion of computation is based on the data precision and to include slowly change time dimension. The final results are displayed in graphical form.

Compared to traditional clustering algorithms, we evaluate two objectives--the compactness in clusters and the looseness between different clusters. DE is a population based search algorithm, which requires few control variables and it is robust, easy to implement. To optimize the two measures simultaneously, a weighing factor method is used for the clustering problem. Experiments on several data sets from UCI machine learning repository show that this new clustering method can achieve good results.

It is very significant to study how to organize and select a good classifier based on their performances. In this paper, three well-known graphical techniques, namely lift charts, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and Precision-Recall (PR) curves are presented. Three graphical techniques that are useful for evaluating the quality of classifiers used in data mining and machine learning. Each technique, normally used and studied separately, defines its own measure of classification quality and its visualization. After a brief survey of these methods, a common mathematical framework is established, which adds some new aspects, explanations and interrelations among these graphical techniques. Finally, the interpretation is given with special focus on different measures of classification quality that are closely related to these three techniques.

Using the promising technology, accurate classification of tumor subtypes at molecular level becomes possible. Meanwhile, it can help discover interesting gene expression patterns to extract underlying biological knowledge. Many machine learning methods such as clustering, classification and so on have been successfully applied. Especially, clustering as a basic unsupervised learning approach is widely used. However, there are still some shortcomings in clustering methods, e.g. automatically deciding the natural clustering number and improving clustering accuracy. Facing these shortcomings in clustering, in this paper, we propose a new clustering ensemble method to solve them, which is prior to what is achieved by a single clustering algorithm, and apply it to DNA microarray data analysis. The final experiment result shows that the new method works well.

Gas is always an important factor which influences the safety production of coal mines. It becomes the essential problem of safety production in coal mines at present. Domestic and overseas mining practice shows that occurrences of gas outburst are regional. The disaster occurrence area accounts for only 8%-20% of whole mine district. The precise prediction of gas emission is very important to coal mines. Gas emission is the synthetic result of stress, gas pressure, and the physical mechanics of coal and so on. It is difficult to determine the gas emission using traditional methods. A novel method, termed Support Vector Machine (SVM), was proposed to predict Gas emission. Based on the statistical learning theory, Support Vector Machine is a new creative learning system, which can find global optimal solutions for problems with high dimensions and non-linearity through small training samples. The model about the relationship between Gas emission and its influence factor is obtained by Support Vector Machine learning from cases history. The result shows this method is feasible, effective and high precision.

SVMs for Automatic Speech Recognition: A survey	Progress in Nonlinear Speech Processing	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Nonlinear Speech Processing (WNSP)	SEP 20-23, 2005	Heraklion, GREECE	COST			SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PHONEME RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; KERNEL	Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are, undoubtedly, the most employed core technique for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Nevertheless, we are still far from achieving high-performance ASR systems. Some alternative approaches, most of them based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), were proposed during the late eighties and early nineties. Some of them tackled the ASR problem using predictive ANNs, while others proposed hybrid HMM/ANN systems. However, despite some achievements, nowadays, the preponderance of Markov Models is a fact. During the last decade, however, a new tool appeared in the field of machine learning that has proved to be able to cope with hard classification problems in several fields of application: the Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs are effective discriminative classifiers with several outstanding characteristics, namely: their solution is that with maximum margin; they are capable to deal with samples of a very higher dimensionality; and their convergence to the minimum of the associated cost function is guaranteed. These characteristics have made SVMs very popular and successful. In this chapter we discuss their strengths and weakness in the ASR context and make a review of the current state-of-the-art techniques. We organize the contributions in two parts: isolated-word recognition and continuous speech recognition. Within the first part we review several techniques to produce the fixed-dimension vectors needed for original SVMs. Afterwards we explore more sophisticated techniques based on the use of kernels capable to deal with sequences of different length. Among them is the DTAK kernel, simple and effective, which rescues an old technique of speech recognition: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Within the second part, we describe some recent approaches to tackle more complex tasks like connected digit recognition or continuous speech recognition using SVMs. Finally we draw some conclusions and outline several ongoing lines of research.

Supervised and unsupervised techniques are used, each with its own benefits and shortcomings. When using supervised techniques, a suitably representative training set is required, which reliably indicates what a human expert wants the system to]cam and recognize. To this aim, we present an approach based on the Dempster-Shafer theory, which exploits the Dempster-Shafer combination rule for automatically building a database of labeled network traffic from raw tcpdump packet captures. We also show that systems trained on such a database perform approximatively as well as the same systems trained on correctly labeled data.

Membrane proteins (MPs) are no exception and although they constitute an estimated 30% of the total number of proteins encoded in mammalian genomes, they are considerably under-represented in structural databases, contributing less than 1% of the protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (www. rcsb. org/pdb). Many drug targets are membrane proteins that act as hormone or chemical messenger receptors and there is considerable interest in this class of proteins shown by the pharmaceutical industry. Structural analysis of membrane proteins is considerably disadvantaged by the difficulty in obtaining crystals. Bioinformatic analysis of protein amino acid sequences affords one route to the preliminary characterisation of protein structure and some of the oldest algorithms attempted prediction of the relatively short, about 25 amino acids, and discrete, transmembrane regions of proteins that span the lipid membrane of cells. Making use of training sets based on known structures of membrane proteins we describe here an application of Applied Neural Nets (ANN) to the identification of transmembrane regions in protein sequences. We focus on the problem of representing the 20 different amino acids in a machine-learning algorithm, comparing four binary representations. A 5-bit representation based on the five structural sub-groups of amino acids proved to be less reliable than one based on a simple 20-bit binary representation that had no grounding in the properties of the amino acid, but gave the best classification rate of 90.0% (89% sensitivity, 90% specificity) and Area under the Curve (AUC) is 0.9381. We conclude that, for the length of amino acid strings used in the Neural Nets, five, the type of encoding is not critical. However for longer strings, where potential functional features of a transmembrane sequence could be conserved, we speculate that the way in which amino acids are represented could influence the effectiveness of neural nets.

In this paper, we propose a statistical model aimed at modeling interactions among human subjects, in particular, conversational audio data is here analyzed. The proposed model, called Coupled Hidden Duration Semi Markov Model, takes inspiration from the large literature on Hidden Markov Models and its variants. The novelty introduced by the model is the capability of dealing with interacting state processes, where 1) states that characterize a single process exhibit different time durations, and 2) different processes involved in an interaction are not synchronized, i.e., their states do not begin/end at the same time instants. Comparative synthetical and real data experiments are presented, showing that the proposed model is able to tackle difficult interactive situations, not otherwise manageable by the state-of-the-art algorithms.

As a matter of fact, graphs offer a versatile alternative to feature vectors in pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. However, the space of graphs contains almost no mathematical structure, and consequently, there is a lack of suitable methods for graph classification. Graph kernels, a novel class of algorithms for pattern analysis, offer an elegant solution to this problem. Graph kernels aim at bridging the gap between statistical and symbolic object representations. In the present paper we propose a general approach to transforming graphs into n-dimensional real vector spaces by means of graph edit distance. As a matter of fact, this approach results in a novel family of graph kernels making a wide range of kernel machines applicable for graphs. With several experimental results we prove the robustness and flexibility of our new method and show that our approach outperforms a standard graph classification method on several graph data sets of diverse nature.

The particularity of the method is that it provides an interpretation of a partition previously obtained on an ill-structured domain, starting from a hierarchical clustering. The methodology uses some statistical tools (as the boxplot multiple, introduced by Tukey, which in our context behave as a powerful tool for numeric variables) together with some machine learning methods, to learn the structure of the data; this allows extracting useful information (using the concept of characterizing variable) for the automatic generation of a set of useful rules for later identification of classes. In this paper the usefulness of CCEC for building domain theories as models supporting later decision-making is addressed.

It is a fact that almost all pre - miRNAs have the characteristic of stem - loop hairpin structures. Therefore those hairpin structures give key clues to the ab initio prediction of pre - miRNAs. However, a large amount of pre - rniRNA - like hairpins can be folded in many genomes. It is challenging to distinguish the real pre - miRNAs from other hairpin sequences with similar stem - loops (pseudo pre - miRNAs). In this paper, to distinguish the real pre - miRNAs from other hairpin sequences with similar stem - loops (pseudo pre - miRNAs), we proposed a novel machine learning method: random forest. Coupled with a hybrid feature which consists of local contiguous structure - sequence composition, minimum of free energy (MFE) of the secondary structure and p - value of randomization test, the prediction model achieves 98.21 % specificity and 95.09% sensitivity.

A reliable identification of RNA-binding sites in proteins is important to understand the molecular details of protein-RNA interaction. In this work, we have developed a machine learning approach, support vector machine (SVM), to predict RNA - binding sites in proteins based on the profile of evolutionary conservation of sequence positions, which only needs protein primary sequence as input of classifier. Using evolutionary information in terms of a position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of each residue and 6 of its closest neighboring residues, our results indicated that RNA - binding residue can be predicted at 67.6% sensitivity, 75.0% specificity and a net prediction (an average of sensitivity and specificity) of 71.3%. This method outperforms previous protein RNA - binding site prediction methods.

To effectively use such a technique, however, we have to develop an automated method for fast and accurately predicting signal peptides and their cleavage sites, particularly in the post-genomic era when the number of protein sequences is being explosively increased. To realize this, the first important thing is to discriminate secretory proteins from non-secretory proteins. On the basis of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, we proposed a new alignment kernel function. The novel approach can be effectively used to extract the statistical properties of protein sequences for machine learning, leading to a higher prediction success rate.

In this article, we present FiberID, a simple yet effective method for identifying and distinguishing three fibrous protein subclasses from their primary sequences. Using a combination of amino acid composition and fast Fourier measurements, FiberID can classify fibrous proteins belonging to these subclasses with high accuracy by using two standard machine learning techniques (decision trees and Naive Bayesian classifiers).

Rapid detection method for microbial spoilage using FT-IR and machine learning	RAPID METHODS FOR FOOD AND FEED QUALITY DETERMINATION			English	Article; Book Chapter						FT-IR; microbial spoilage; metabolic fingerprinting; evolutionary-based algorithms	TRANSFORM INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; PYROLYSIS MASS-SPECTROMETRY; QUANTITATIVE DETECTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; MEAT SPOILAGE; MUSCLE FOODS; WHOLE MEAT; CHICKEN; QUALITY; METABOLOMICS	The requirement for real-time monitoring in the modern and highly automated food processing environment has stimulated research into rapid microbiological testing. The conventional microbiological approach to food sampling has changed little over the last half century. It has been estimated that there are currently in excess of 40 methods to measure and detect bacterial spoilage in meats. The ideal method for the on-line microbiological analysis of meat would be rapid, non-destructive, reagentless and relatively inexpensive. These requirements can be met via the application of a spectroscopic approach. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is a rapid, non-destructive technique, which can be used to generate biochemical fingerprints. It is shown that this technique can be used directly on the surface of food and, with appropriate machine learning, can produce accurate estimates of microbial loads on chicken and beef. It is, therefore, believed this method has considerable potential for application in the food industry.	[Ellis, D.

To acquire better features and mine semantic relationships of entities in documents, we develop domain ontology and make use of ontology knowledge rather than flat gazetteers, proper lexicons or term lists. The basic steps that we put forward are: creating domain ontology seeds; training resolution model by adopting adaptive Machine Learning algorithms; gaining new knowledge and recognizing anaphora relations. Then in section 5, we put forward the strategy of semantic similarity computing and expect to mine semantic similarity feature in specific domain with general linguistic ontology resource-HowNet(1), so as to improve the performance of NPs' coreference resolution. The concrete method is to acquire NPs' concept similarity from sememe similarity.

These recommenders learn a user profile, based on rating feedback from the user on, e.g., books, songs, or TV programs, and use machine learning techniques to infer the ratings of new items. The techniques commonly used are collaborative filtering and naive Bayesian classification, and they are known to have several problems, in particular the cold-start problem and its slow adaptivity to changing user preferences. These problems can be mitigated by allowing the user to set up or manipulate his profile. In this paper, we propose an extension to the naive Bayesian classifier that enhances user control. We do this by maintaining and flexibly integrating two profiles for a user, one learned by rating feedback, and one created by the user. We in particular show how the cold-start problem is mitigated.

Users are very often overwhelmed by the huge amount of information and are faced with a big challenge to find the most relevant information in the right time. Recommender systems aim at pruning this information space and directing users toward the items that best meet their needs and interests. Web Recommendation has been an active application area in Web Mining and Machine Learning research. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning perspective toward the problem, based on reinforcement learning. Unlike other recommender systems, our system does not use the static patterns discovered from web usage data, instead it learns to make recommendations as the actions it performs in each situation. We model the problem as Q-Learning while employing concepts and techniques commonly applied in the web usage mining domain. We propose that the reinforcement learning paradigm provides an appropriate model for the recommendation problem, as well as a framework in which the system constantly interacts with the user and learns from her behavior. Our experimental evaluations support our claims and demonstrate how this approach can improve the quality of web recommendations.

To study degradation of alpine cold meadow in the headwater region from 1994 to 2006, Remote Sensing and the machine learning approach was used. Firstly, a classification system, considering the dynamic evolution process of alpine meadow, was offered. Secondly, the support vector machines approach was introduced into classification of satellite remote sensing images. The experiment results show that, the introduced classification system can express dynamic process of alpine cold meadow degradation efficiently; SVM has obtained better precision than minimum distance and maximum likelihood methods for TM images interpretation. Furthermore, the research indicates that degradation of the alpine cold meadow was most marked from 1994 to 2006, and the area of BS&BR land has expanded rapidly.

Varying, illumination due to atmospheric conditions (such as clouds) and shadows cause different pixels belonging to the same class to present different spectral vectors, increasing the within class variability and hindering classification. This is specially serious in precision applications such as variety discrimination in precision agriculture, which depends on subtle spectral differences. In this study, we use machine learning techniques for supervised classification, and we also analyze the variability within and among plots and within and among sites, in order to address the generalizability of the results.

The cost of expert human labour to correct automatic recognition errors dominates the cost of such projects. To reduce the number of recognition errors in the OMR process, we present an innovative approach to adapt the system dynamically, taking advantage of the human editing work that is part of any digitisation project. The corrected data are used to perform MAP adaptation, a machine-learning technique used previously in speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR). Our experiments show that this technique can reduce editing costs by more than half.

Incorporation of features like secondary structure, solvent accessibility, or evolutionary information improve sequence to structure alignment accuracy, but conventional generative estimation techniques for alignment models impose independence assumptions that make these features difficult to include in a principled way. In this paper, we overcome this problem using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) method that provides a well-founded way of estimating complex alignment models with hundred-thousands of parameters. Furthermore, we show that the method can be trained using a variety of loss functions. In a rigorous empirical evaluation, the SVM algorithm outperforms the generative alignment method SSALN, a highly accurate generative alignment model that incorporates structural information. The alignment model learned by the SVM aligns 47% of the residues correctly and aligns over 70% of the residues within a shift of 4 positions.

Recently, a compendium of mRNA expression levels and protein abundances were released for the entire genome of the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus. The availability of these two data sets facilitate using machine learning methods to automatically infer plausible correspondences between the gene products. Knowing these correspondences can be helpful either for predicting protein abundances from microarray data or as an independent source of information that can be used for learning richer models such as regulatory networks. We propose a probabilistic model that relates protein abundances to mRNA expression levels. Using cross-mapped data from the above-mentioned studies, we learn the model and then score the genes for their strength of relationship by performing probabilistic inference in the learned model. While we gave a simplified outline of our technique in a publication aimed at biologists (Cell 2006), in this paper, we give a complete description of the Bayesian model and the computational technique used to perform inference. In addition, we demonstrate that the Bayesian technique achieves mappings with higher statistical significance, compared to standard linear regression and a maximum likelihood version of the proposed model.

Despite much progress in side-chain prediction, performance is far from satisfactory. As an example, the ROSETTA program that uses simulated annealing to select the minimum energy conformations, correctly predicts the first two side-chain angles for approximately 72% of the buried residues in a standard data set. Is further improvement more likely to come from better search methods, or from better energy functions? Given that exact minimization of the energy is NP hard, it is difficult to get a systematic answer to this question. In this paper, we present a novel search method and a novel method for learning energy functions from training data that are both based on Tree Reweighted Belief Propagation (TRBP). We find that TRBP can find the global optimum of the ROSETTA energy function in a few minutes of computation for approximately 85% of the proteins in a standard benchmark set. TRBP can also effectively bound the partition function which enables using the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) framework for learning. Interestingly, finding the global minimum does not significantly improve side-chain prediction for an energy function based on ROSETTA's default energy terms (less than 0.1%), while learning new weights gives a significant boost from 72% to 78%. Using a recently modified ROSETTA energy function with a softer Lennard-Jones repulsive term, the global optimum does improve prediction accuracy from 77% to 78%. Here again, learning new weights improves side-chain modeling even further to 80%. Finally, the highest accuracy (82.6%) is obtained using an extended rotamer library and CRF learned weights. Our results suggest that combining machine learning with approximate inference can improve the state-of-the-art in side-chain prediction.

Efforts to exploit peptide RT for peptide identification can be frustrated by its variability across liquid chromatography analyses. We show that peptide RT can be reliably predicted by training a support vector regressor on a single chromatography run. This dynamically trained model outperforms a published statically trained model of peptide RT across diverse chromatography conditions. In addition, the model can be used to filter peptide identifications that produce large discrepancies between observed and predicted RT. After filtering, estimated true positive peptide identifications increase by as much as 50% at a false discovery rate of 3%, with the largest increase for non-specific cleavage with elastase.

In this paper, we describe a predictive modeling approach for studying regulatory networks, based on a machine learning algorithm called MEDUSA. MEDUSA integrates promoter sequence, mRNA expression, and transcription factor occupancy data to learn gene regulatory programs that predict the differential expression of target genes. Instead of using clustering or correlation of expression profiles to infer regulatory relationships, MEDUSA determines condition-specific regulators and discovers regulatory motifs that mediate the regulation of target genes. In this way, MEDUSA meaningfully models biological mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. MEDUSA solves the problem of predicting the differential (up/down) expression of target genes by using boosting, a technique from statistical learning, which helps to avoid overfitting as the algorithm searches through the high-dimensional space of potential regulators and sequence motifs. Experimental results demonstrate that MEDUSA achieves high prediction accuracy on held-out experiments (test data), that is, data not seen in training. We also present context-specific analysis of MEDUSA regulatory programs for DNA damage and hypoxia, demonstrating that MEDUSA identifies key regulators and motifs in these processes. A central challenge in the field is the difficulty of validating reverse-engineered networks in the absence of a gold standard. Our approach of learning regulatory programs provides at least a partial solution for the problem: MEDUSA's prediction accuracy on held-out data gives a concrete and statistically sound way to validate how well the algorithm performs. With MEDUSA, statistical validation becomes a prerequisite for hypothesis generation and network building rather than a secondary consideration.

However, when no accurate simulator exists for the type of motion in question, all learning must occur on the physical robot itself. In such a case, there is a high premium on quick, efficient learning (specifically, learning with low sample complexity). Recent results in learning locomotion have demonstrated the feasibility of learning fast walks directly on quadrupedal robots. This paper demonstrates that it is also possible to learn a higher-level skill requiring more fine motor coordination, again with all learning occurring directly on the robot. In particular, the paper presents a learned ball-grasping skill on a commercially available Sony Aibo robot, with no human intervention other than battery changes. The learned skill significantly outperforms our best hand-tuned solution. As the learned grasping skill relies on a learned walk, we characterize our learning implementation within the layered learning formalism. To our knowledge, the two learned layers represent the first use of layered learning on a physical robot.

However, quickly moving quadruped robots, including those with learned gaits, often move in such a way so as to cause unsteady camera motions which degrade the robot's visual capabilities. This paper presents an implementation of the policy gradient machine learning algorithm that searches for a parameterized walk while optimizing for both speed and stability. To the best of our knowledge, previous learned walks have all focused exclusively on speed. Our method is fully implemented and tested on the Sony Aibo ERS-7 robot platform. The resulting gait is reasonably fast and considerably more stable compared to our previous fast gaits. We demonstrate that this stability can significantly improve the robot's visual object recognition.

Such forms facilitate understanding and acceptance of the learned knowledge, and making mental models that are useful for decision making. An initial version of the AQ21-NI program for natural induction and its several novel features are briefly described. The performance of the program is illustrated by an example of deriving medical diagnostic rules from micro-array data.

However, for a given system, there may be more than one reduct to be selected. Different reducts will lead to discovered knowledge, which may be concise, precise, general, understandable and practically useful in different levels. It is a crucial issue to select the most suitable features or properties of the objects in a dataset in the machine learning process. In this paper, some external information is added to information system and may be simply regarded as user preference on attributes. Consequently, it will guide the procedure of retrieving reducts, which will give birth to the reduct subject to preference order of attributes.

Underlying the data structure, there is a domain concept that is an understandable description for humans and supports other machine learning techniques. In this work, Map Granule (MC) construction is introduced. A MG comprises of multilevel granules with their hierarchy relations. We propose a rough set based granular computing to induce approximation of a domain concept hierarchy of an information system. An algorithm is proposed to select a sequence of attribute subsets which is necessary to partition a granularity hierarchically. In each level of granulation, reducts and core are applied to retain the specific concepts of a granule whereas common attributes are applied to exclude the common knowledge and generate a more general concept. The information granule relations are represented by a tree structure in which the relation strengths are defined by a rough ratio of specificness/coarseness.

The diversification of sub-classifiers is one of necessary conditions for improving the classification accuracy. To obtain more diverse sub-classifiers we extend the bagging approach by integrating sampling different distributions of learning examples with selecting multiple subsets of features. We summarize results of our experiments on studying the usefulness of different feature selection techniques in this extension. The main aim of the paper is to examine the use of three methods for aggregating predictions of sub-classifiers in the extended bagging classifier. Our experimental results show that the extended classifier, with a dynamic choice of answers instead of a simple voting aggregation rule, is more accurate than standard bagging.

However, it is not clear how this information is processed. We will analyze brain responses using machine learning methods based on rough set theory. We will test the expertise of the visual area V4, which is responsible for shape classifications. Characteristic of each stimulus are treated as a set of learning attributes. We assume that bottom-up information is related to hypotheses, while top-down information is related to predictions. Therefore, neuronal responses are divided into three categories. Category 0 occurs if cell response is below 20 spikes/s (sp/s), indicating that the hypothesis is not valid. Category I occurs if cell activity is higher than 20 spikes, implying the hypothesis is valid. Category 2 occurs if cell response is above 40 sp/s; in this case we conclude that the hypothesis and prediction are valid. By using experimental data we make a decision table for each cell, and generate equivalence classes. We express the brains basic concepts by means of the learners basic categories. By approximating stimulus categories with concepts of different cells we determine core properties of cells, and differences between them. On this basis we have created profiles of their receptive field properties.

The paper views the task as a two-class classification problem. A pair of question variable and OWL element is a sample. Two classes of "Matched" and "Unmatched" explain two relations between the question variable and the OWL element in a given sample. Building appropriate semantic mapping is the same as classifying the sample to a "Matched" class by an effective machine learning method and a trained model. Two types of features of samples are selected. Syntactical features denote the syntactical structure of a given sample. Semantic features present multiple relations between the question variable and the OWL element in one sample. Preliminary experimental results show that the sum precision of the learning-based model is better than that of the constraints-based method.

In the traditional "reduction" sense, the goal is to find the smallest number of attributes such that they enable us to discern each tuple or each decision class. However, once we pay attention also to the number of attribute values, that is, the size/resolution of each attribute domain, another goal appears. An interesting question is like, which one is better in the following two situations 1) we can discern individual tuples with a single attribute described in fine granularity, and 2) we can do this with a few attributes described in rough granularity. Such a question is related to understandability and Kansei expression of data as well as rules. We propose a criterion and an algorithm to find near-optimal solutions for the criterion. In addition, we show some illustrative results for some databases in UCI repository of machine learning databases.

Therefore, the inclusion of costs into learning, also named cost-sensitive learning, has been regarded as one of the most relevant topics of future machine learning research. Rough set theory is a powerful mathematic tool dealing with inconsistent information for attribute dependence analysis, knowledge reduction and decision rule extraction. However, it is insensitive to the costs of misclassification due to the absence of a mechanism of considering the subjective knowledge. This paper discusses problems connected with introducing the subjective knowledge into rough set learning and proposes a weighted rough set approach for cost-sensitive learning. In this method, weights are employed to represent the subjective knowledge of costs and a weighted information system is defined firstly. With the introduction of weights, weighted attribute dependence analysis is carried out and an index of weighted approximate quality is given. Furthermore, weighted attribute reduction algorithm and weighted rule extraction algorithm are designed to find the reducts and rules with the consideration of weights. Based on the proposed weighted rough set, a series of comparing experimentations with several familiar general techniques on cost-sensitive learning are constructed. The results show that the approach of weighted rough set produces averagely the minimum misclassification costs and the lowest high cost errors.

In that approach, which is similar in spirit to recursive networks, molecules are considered as structured data, represented as graphs. For each example of the data set, a mathematical function (graph machine) is built, whose structure reflects the structure of the molecule under consideration; it is the combination of identical parameterised functions, called "node functions" (e.g. a feedforward neural network). The parameters of the node functions, shared both within and across the graph machines, are adjusted during training with the "shared weights" technique. Model selection is then performed by traditional cross-validation. Therefore, the designer's main task consists in finding the optimal complexity for the node function. The efficiency of this new approach has been demonstrated in many QSAR or QSPR tasks, as well as in modelling the activities of complex chemicals (e.g. the toxicity of a family of phenols or the anti-HIV activities of HEPT derivatives). It generally outperforms traditional techniques without requiring the selection and computation of descriptors.

With many heuristics to choose from, several tools have enabled the use of schema matcher ensembles, combining principles by which different schema matchers judge the similarity between concepts. In this work, we investigate means of estimating the uncertainty involved in schema matching and harnessing it to improve an ensemble outcome. We propose a model for schema matching, based on simple probabilistic principles. We then propose the use of machine learning in determining the best mapping and discuss its pros and cons. Finally, we provide a thorough empirical analysis, using both real-world and synthetic data, to test the proposed technique. We conclude that the proposed heuristic performs well, given an accurate modeling of uncertainty in matcher decision making.

We enlarged the scope of existing causal structure learning algorithms by using the form-free information-theoretic concept of mutual information and by introducing the complexity criterion for selecting direct relations among equivalent relations. The underlying probability distribution of experimental data is estimated by kernel density estimation. We then reported on the benefits of a dependency analysis and the decompositional capacities of causal models. Useful qualitative models, providing insight into the role of every performance factor, were inferred from experimental data. This paper reports on the results for a LU decomposition algorithm and on the study of the parameter sensitivity of the Kakadu implementation of the JPEG-2000 standard. Next, the analysis was used to search for generic performance characteristics of the applications.

For the assessment of software quality, typically sets of complementing metrics are used since individual metrics cover only isolated quality aspects rather than a quality characteristic as a whole. The choice of the metrics within such metric sets, however, is non-trivial. Metrics may intuitively appear to be complementing, but they often are in fact non-orthogonal, i.e. the information they provide may overlap to some extent. In the past, such redundant metrics have been identified, for example, by statistical correlation methods. This paper presents, based on machine learning, a novel approach to minimise sets of metrics by identifying and removing metrics which have little effect on the overall quality assessment. To demonstrate the application of this approach, results from an experiment are provided. In this experiment, a set of metrics that is used to assess the analysability of test suites that are specified using the Testing and Test Control Notation (TTCN-3) is investigated.

A two-step model for defect density estimation	SEAA 2007: 33rd EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications, Proceedings	EUROMICRO CONFERENCE - PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications	AUG 27-31, 2007	Lubeck, GERMANY					Identifying and locating defects in software projects is a difficult task. Further, estimating the density of defects is more difficult. Measuring software in a continuous and disciplined manner brings many advantages such as accurate estimation of project costs and schedules, and improving product and process qualities. Detailed analysis of software metric data gives significant clues about the locations and magnitude of possible defects in a program. The aim of this research is to establish an improved method for Predicting software quality via identifying the defect density of fault prone modules using machine-learning techniques. We constructed a two-step model that predicts defect density by taking module metric data into consideration. Our proposed model utilizes classification and regression type learning methods consecutively. The results of the experiments on public data sets show that the two-step model enhances the overall performance measures as compared to applying only regression methods.

The horizontally. mounted tablet provides the user with high resolution stylus input, which is augmented by multi-touch interaction and recognition of untagged everyday physical objects using new stereo vision and machine learning techniques. This provides a novel and interesting interactive tabletop arrangement, capable of supporting a variety of fluid multi-touch interactions, including symmetric and asymmetric bimanual input, coupled with the potential for incorporating tangible objects into the user interface. When used in a remote context, these features are combined with the ability to see visual representations of remote users' hands and remote physical objects placed on top of the surface. This combination of bimanual and tangible, interaction and sharing of remote gestures and physical objects provides a new way to collaborate remotely, complementing existing channels such as audio and video conferencing.

Current systems in this domain mostly make use of special touch-sensitive hardware, require cameras to be mounted behind the display, or are based on infrared sensors used in various configurations. The very few that use ordinary cameras mounted overhead for touch detection fail to do so accurately due to the difficult), in computing the proximity of fingertips to the surface with a precision that would match the behaviour of a truly touch-sensitive surface. This paper describes a novel computer vision algorithm that can robustly identify finger tips and detect touch with a precision of a few millimetres above the surface. The algorithm relies on machine learning methods and a geometric finger model to achieve the required precision, and can be 'trained' to work in different physical settings. We provide a quantitative evaluation of the method and demonstrate its use for gesture based interactions with ordinary tablet displays, both in single user and remote collaboration scenarios.

Nowadays, databases are distributed among two or more parties because of different reasons such as physical and geographical restrictions and the most important issue is privacy. Related data is normally maintained by more than one organization, each of which wants to keep its individual information private. Thus, privacy-preserving techniques and protocols are designed to perform data mining on distributed environments when privacy is highly concerned. Cluster analysis is a technique in data mining, by which data can be divided into some meaningful clusters, and it has an important role in different fields such as bio-informatics, marketing, machine learning, climate and medicine. k-means Clustering is a prominent algorithm in this category which creates a one-level clustering of data. In this paper we introduce privacy-preserving protocols for this algorithm, along with a protocol for Secure comparison, known as the Millionaires' Problem, as a sub-protocol, to handle the clustering of horizontally or vertically partitioned data among two or more parties.

The successful application of machine learning techniques for learning of ontologies from textual data, i.e. mining for the Semantic Web, contributes to this trend. However, no principal approaches exist so far for mining from the Semantic Web. We investigate how machine learning algorithms can be made amenable for directly taking advantage of the rich knowledge expressed in ontologies and associated instance data. Kernel methods have been successfully employed in various learning tasks and provide a clean framework for interfacing between non-vectorial data and machine learning algorithms. In this spirit, we express the problem of mining instances in ontologies as the problem of defining valid corresponding kernels. We present a principled framework for designing such kernels by means of decomposing the kernel computation into specialized kernels for selected characteristics of an ontology which can be flexibly assembled and tuned. Initial experiments on real world Semantic Web data enjoy promising results and show the usefulness of our approach.

This paper describes Squirrel, a search and browse toot that provides access to semantically annotated data. Squirrel provides combined keyword based and semantic searching. The intention is to provide a balance between the speed and ease of use of simple free text search and the power of semantic search. In addition, the ontological approach provides the user with a much richer browsing experience. Squirrel builds on and integrates a number of semantic technology components. These include machine learning and information extraction components which generate, extract and manage semantic metadata contained within and about textual documents at index time. A number of run-time components have also been integrated to deliver an enhanced user experience which goes beyond merely presenting a list of documents as a query response. The tool has been trialled and evaluated in two case studies and we report early results from this exercise, revealing promising results.

Since different organizations model their processes differently, the discovery and retrieval of similar semantic business processes is necessary in order to foster inter-organizational collaborations. This paper presents our approach of using iSPARQL- our imprecise query engine based on SPARQL- to query the OWL MIT Process Handbook-a large collection of over 5000 sernantic business processes. We particularly show how easy it is to use iSPARQL to perform the presented process retrieval task. Furthermore, since choosing the best performing similarity strategy is a non-trivial, data-, and context-dependent task, we evaluate the performance of three simple and two human-engineered similarity strategies. In addition, we conduct machine learning experiments to learn similarity measures showing that complementary information contained in the different notions of similarity strategies provide a very high retrieval accuracy. Our preliminary results indicate that iSPARQL is indeed useful for extending the reach of queries and that it, therefore, is an enabler for inter- and intra- organizational collaborations.

Traditionally, when the supervised machine learning algorithms are used for pattern classification, raw data should be encoded into numerical vectors. This encoding may be difficult, depending on a given application area of pattern classification. For example, in text categorization, encoding full texts given as raw data into numerical vectors leads to two main problems: huge dimensionality and sparse distribution. In this research, we encode full texts into string vectors, and apply the SVM to string vectors for text categorization.

Quick and accurate identification of the root cause of failures is an important prerequisite for building reliable systems. We describe a pragmatic model-based technique for application- specific fault diagnosis based on indicators, symptoms and rules. Customized wrapper services then apply this knowledge to reason about root causes of failures. In addition to user-provided diagnosis models we show that given a set of past classified fault events it is possible to extract new models through learning that are able to diagnose new faults. We investigated and compared algorithms of supervised classification learning and cluster analysis. Our approach was implemented as part of the Otho Toolkit that 'service-enables' legacy applications based on synthesis of wrapper service.

In this paper we describe a new, lightweight method for TCP throughput prediction that can generate accurate forecasts for a broad range of file sizes and path conditions. Our method is based on Support Vector Regression modeling that uses a combination of prior file transfers and measurements of simple path properties. We calibrate and evaluate the capabilities of our throughput predictor in an extensive set of lab-based experiments where ground truth can be established for path properties using highly accurate passive measurements. We report the performance for our method in the ideal case of using our passive path property measurements over a range of test configurations. Our results show that for bulk transfers in heavy traffic, TCP throughput is predicted within 10% of the actual value 87% of the time, representing nearly a 3-fold improvement in accuracy over prior history-based methods. In the same lab environment, we assess our method using less accurate active probe measurements of path properties, and show that predictions can be made within 10% of the actual value nearly 50% of the time over a range of file sizes and traffic conditions. This result represents approximately a 60% improvement over history-based methods with a much lower impact on end-to-end paths. Finally, we implement our predictor in a tool called PathPerf and test it in experiments conducted on wide area paths. The results demonstrate that PathPerf predicts TCP throughput accurately over a variety of paths.

In previous research efforts the capabilities and potential of a Bayesian belief network (BN) model-based approach to support situation assessment have been demonstrated. In our own prior research, we have presented and formalized a hybrid process for situation assessment model development that seeks to ameliorate specific concerns and drawbacks associated with using a BN-based model construct. Specifically, our hybrid methodology addresses the significant knowledge acquisition requirements and the associated subjective nature of using subject matter experts (SMEs) for model development. Our methodology consists of two distinct functional elements: an off-line mechanism for rapid construction of a Bayesian belief network (BN) library of situation assessment models tailored to different situations and derived from knowledge elicitation with SMEs; and an on-line machine-learningbased mechanism to learn, tune, or adapt BN model parameters and structure. The adaptation supports the ability to adjust the models over time to respond to novel situations not initially available or anticipated during initial model construction, thus ensuring that the models continue to meet the dynamic requirements of performing the situation assessment function within dynamic application environments such as an AOC. In this paper, we apply and demonstrate the hybrid approach within the specific context of an AOC-based air campaign monitoring scenario. We detail both the initial knowledge elicitation and subsequent machine learning phases of the model development process, as well as demonstrate model performance within an operational context.

Survey of approaches and experiments in decision-level fusion of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) products - art. no. 65670V	Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI	APR 09-11, 2007	Orlando, FL	SPIE				The US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is exploring the decision-level fusion (DLF) trade space in the Fusion for Identifying Targets Experiment (FITE) program. FITE is surveying past DLF approaches and experiments. This paper reports preliminary findings from that survey, which ultimately plans to place the various studies in a common framework, identify trends, and make recommendations on the additional studies that would best inform the trade space of how to fuse ATR products and how ATR products should be improved to support fusion. We tentatively conclude that DLF is better at rejecting incorrect decisions than in adding correct decisions, a larger ATR library is better (for a constant Pid), a better source ATR has many mild attractors rather than a few large attractors, and fusion will be more beneficial when there are no dominant sources. Dependencies between the sources diminish performance, even when that dependency is well modeled. However, poor models of dependencies do not significantly further diminish performance. Distributed fusion is not driven by performance, so centralized fusion is an appropriate focus for FITE. For multi-ATR fusion, the degree of improvement may depend on the participating ATRs having different OC sensitivities. The machine learning literature is an especially rich source for the impact of imperfect (learned in their case) models. Finally and perhaps most significantly, even with perfect models and independence, the DLF gain may be quite modest and it may be fairly easy to check whether the best possible performance is good enough for a given application.

First, this paper put forward the email, classification model and the basic assumptions. Then we discussed the email features extraction and selection issues, especially focused on the documents frequency and information gain methods, and simultaneously performed the features reduction to the rule of thumb. Finally, a comparative study has been driven on three different kinds of algorithms based on Bayesian methods, and so the influences caused by different feature selection methods.

However, the performance of NBC model can be further improved if the data and the classifier better fit together. This paper explores the feature value reduction and feature selection method for the improvement of NBC model. Feature value reduction is a way to reduce the number of values for the features. After the process of feature value reduction, some non-important values which have little contribution to classification could be ignored, making the contribution of each feature value match its importance. Feature selection is a way to reduce the dimensionality. It attempts to remove as many irrelevant and redundant features as possible. Both methods perform better than the original NBC model. A new method which combining these two methods provide more advantages than individual itself. Using UCI Machine Learning repository, we compare and contrast the two methods and demonstrate the advantages of the combined method.

K-prototype clustering is one of the most commonly used methods in data mining for this kind of data. We borrow the ideas from the multiple classifiers combing technology, use k-prototype as the basis clustering algorithm to design a multi-level clustering ensemble algorithm in this paper, which adaptively selects attributes for re-clustering. Comparison experiments on Adult data set from UCI machine learning data repository show very competitive results and the proposed method is suitable for data editing.

When there is large number of categories of data to classify, training it would be very difficult. Expanded from Hyper-Sphere One-Class SVM (HS-SVM), Hyper-Sphere Multi-Class SVM (HSMC-SVM), which builds a HS-SVM for every category of data, is a direct classifier. Its training speed is faster than the combined Multi-Class classifiers. In order to fast train the HSMC-SVM a training algorithm following the idea of SMO is proposed. For researching the generalization performance of HSMC-SVM, the theoretic upper bound of generalizing error of HSMC-SVM is analyzed too. As shown in the numeric experiments, the training speed of HSMC-SVM is faster than 1-v-r and 1-v-1, but the classification precision is lower than them. HSMC-SVM provides a new idea on researching fast directed multi-class classifiers in machine learning area.

To make the prediction process transparent (reversible), spline kernel based methods were proposed by Gunn. However, the original solution method, termed SUpport vector Parsimonious ANOVA (SUPANOVA) was computationally very complex and demanding. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic to compute the optimal sparse vector in SUPANOVA that replaces the original solver for the convex quadratic problem of very high dimensionality.

Differentiated Services (DiffServ) QoS model is adopted by many recent and upcoming networks standard. Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user. Cross-user classifications yield average correctness up to 74.15%.

Successful "in silico" design of new efficient uranyl binders	SOLVENT EXTRACTION AND ION EXCHANGE			English	Article						QSPR; ISIDA program; in silico design; solvent extraction; uranyl cation	SUBSTRUCTURAL MOLECULAR FRAGMENTS; STRUCTURE-PROPERTY; COMBINATORIAL LIBRARY; NEURAL-NETWORK; COMPLEXATION; DESCRIPTORS; GENERATION; AMIDES; QSPR	ISIDA (In Silico Design and Data Analysis) software have been used for computer-aided molecular design of novel monoamides that efficiently extract U(VI). A set of available experimental uranyl partition coefficients (logD) in a water/ toluene system for 19 monoamides has been used in order to establish quantitative relationships between the structure of the molecules and their extraction properties using different machine- learning methods (multi-linear regression analysis, associated neural networks, support vector machine). Then, developed structure-property models have been applied to screen a virtual combinatorial library containing about 10,500 molecules. Hits' selection has been performed taking into account for the extraction property of molecules, their aqueous solubility (potential extractants must not be soluble in water), and synthetic feasibility. Selected 21 hits have been synthesized and studied experimentally as uranyl extractants using the same protocol as for the molecules from the initial data set. Experiment shows that the theoretical calculations reasonably well predict logD values for novel compounds. The data set of novel monoamides has been significantly enriched by efficient uranyl binders. One of the novel molecules displays a slightly larger affinity for uranyl than previously known extractants.

To give motivation and context to the rest of the survey, we start by presenting some (published) applications of within-network inference. After a brief formulation of this problem and a discussion of probabilistic inference in arbitrary networks, we survey machine learning work applied to networked data, along with some important predecessors-mostly from the statistics and pattern recognition literature. We then describe an application of within-network inference in the domain of suspicion scoring in social networks. We close the paper with pointers to toolkits and benchmark data sets used in machine learning research on classification in network data. We hope that such a survey will be a useful resource to workshop participants, and perhaps will be complemented by others.

The application of machine learning techniques as an adjunct to clinical decision making in alcohol dependence treatment	SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE			English	Article						alcohol treatment; machine learning; Bayesian; decision tree	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MEDICAL STATISTICS; INDIVIDUALS; OUTCOMES; TRIALS; SCALE	With few exceptions, research in the addictive sciences has relied on linear statistics and methodologies. Addiction involves a complex array of nonlinear behaviors. This study applies two machine learning techniques, Bayesian and decision tree classifiers, in the assessment of outcome of an alcohol dependence treatment program. These nonlinear approaches are compared to a standard linear analysis. Seventy-three alcohol-dependent subjects undertaking a 12-week cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program and 66 subjects undertaking an identical program but also prescribed the relapse prevention agent Acamprosate were employed in this study. Demographic, alcohol use, dependence severity, craving, health-related quality of life, and psychological measures at baseline were used to predict abstinence at 12 weeks. Decision trees had a 77% predictive accuracy across both data sets, Bayesian networks 73%, and discriminant analysis 42%. Combined with clinical experience, machine learning approaches offer promise in understanding the complex relationships that underlie treatment outcome for abstinence-based alcohol treatment programs.

This interest has yielded several publications where new methods for the discriminative learning of both structure and parameters have been proposed. In this paper we present an empirical study used to illustrate how discriminative learning performs with respect to generative learning using simple Bayesian network classifiers such as naive Bayes or TAN, and we discuss when and why a discriminative learning is preferred. We also analyzed how log-likelihood and conditional log-likelihood scores guide the learning process of Bayesian network classifiers.

In this paper, we propose a prototype system for the practical integration of weighted fuzzy logic programs with relational database systems in order to provide efficient query answering services. In the system, a dynamic weighted fuzzy logic program is a set of rules together with a set of database queries, fuzzification transformations and fact derivation rules, which allow the provided set of rules to be augmented with a set of fuzzy facts retrieved from the underlying databases. The weights of the rules may be estimated by a neural network-based machine learning process using some specially designated for this purpose training database data.

We evaluate the approach via simulations using two probing models: a packet train probing model and a pathChirp-like probing model. The simulation results show that the former cannot yield accurate estimates in our system; however, using the pathChirp-like probing model, the proposed approach can estimate the available bandwidth with moderate traffic overhead more accurately than two widely used tools, pathChirp and Spruce. Moreover, we propose a normalization method that improves our approach's ability to estimate available bandwidth, even if there are no samples with similar properties to the measured path in the training dataset. The effectiveness and simplicity of this novel approach make it a promising scheme that goes a long way toward achieving accurate estimation of available bandwidth on Internet paths.

Among the vast range of clustering algorithms, K-means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. The basic principle of the K-means algorithm is to know how different distance measure is defined. It is a critical issue for K-means users. For example, how can we select a unique distance measure method for an optimum clustering task? Our research provides a statistical based Unique Distance Measure Approach for K-means (UDMA-Km) to this issue. We consider 112 supervised datasets and measure the statistical data characteristics using central tendency measure. Those data characteristics are split using well known entropy method to generate the rules. Finally, the generated rules are used to select the unique distance measure for K-means algorithm. The experiment is conducted within 112 problems and 10 fold cross validation methods. The most significant contribution of our study is that a new algorithm was created and the new algorithm can be used and has been used to solve any clustering tasks very quickly and provide much better optimum performance.

It has been observed that an important source of errors in machine-learning based approaches to this task, is the wrong disambiguation of the third person singular neuter pronoun as either referential or non-referential. In this paper, we investigate whether a machine learning based approach can be successfully applied to the disambiguation of the neuter pronoun in Dutch and show a modest potential effect of this disambiguation on the results of a machine learning based coreference resolution system for Dutch.

Falling outside the scope of the standard Latin encoding, these characters are often represented in digital language resources as their unmarked equivalents. This renders corpus compilation more difficult, as these languages typically do not have the benefit of large electronic dictionaries to perform diacritic restoration. This paper describes experiments with a machine learning approach that is able to automatically restore diacritics on the basis of local graphemic context. We apply the method to the African languages of Ciluba, Gikuyu, Kikamba, Maa, Sesotho sa Leboa, Tshivenda and Yoruba and contrast it with experiments on Czech, Dutch, French, German and Romanian, as well as Vietnamese and Chinese Pinyin.

This paper presents a study where, using a wide range of speech parameters, improvement in emotion recognition rates is analyzed. Using an emotional multimodal bilingual database for Spanish and Basque, emotion recognition rates in speech have significantly improved for both languages comparing with previous studies. In this particular case, as in previous studies, machine learning techniques based on evolutive algorithms (EDA) have proven to be the best emotion recognition rate optimizers.

In this paper a neural network is used to predict production potential for a single formation of SE New Mexico region. The process involved gathering data for use as potential inputs, collecting production data at known wells, selecting optimal inputs, developing and testing various network architectures, making predictions, analyzing and applying the results. This predicted production was further refined by excluding production at locations where the Woodford shale was not present. Results were evaluated by inspecting a map of predicted production and performing statistical testing, including a correlation of predicted and actual production, which produced a correlation coefficient of 0.79. The results were then used by the Devonian FEE Tool, an expert system designed to reduce exploration risk.

A randomized algorithm for BBCSPs in the Prover-Verifier model	Theoretical Aspects of Computing - ICTAC 2007, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC 2007)	SEP 26-28, 2007	Macao, PEOPLES R CHINA	Formal Methods Europe, Macao Polytech Inst, United Natl Univ			LINEAR-TIME ALGORITHM	In this paper we introduce a Prover-Verifier model for analyzing the computational complexity of a class of Constraint Satisfaction problems termed Binary Boolean Constraint Satisfaction problems (BBCSPs). BBCSPs represent an extremely general class of constraint satisfaction problems and find applications in a wide variety of domains including constraint programming, puzzle solving and program testing. We establish that each instance of a BBCSP admits a coin-flipping Turing Machine that halts in time polynomial in the size of the input. The prover P in the Prover-Verifier model is endowed with very limited powers; in particular, it has no memory and it can only pose restricted queries to the verifier. The verifier on the other hand is both omniscient in that it is cognizant of all the problem details and insincere in that it does not have to decide a priori on the intended proof. However, the verifier must stay consistent in its responses. Inasmuch as our provers will be memoryless and our verifiers will be asked for extremely simple certificates, our work establishes the existence of a simple, randomized algorithm for BBCSPs.

The MILP model concurrently optimizes the parameters of the user-provided individual discriminant functions and implements a decision boundary for an optimal separation of data under analysis. The MILP model is extensively tested on six well-studied datasets in data mining research. The comparison of numerical results by the MILP-based classification of data with those produced by the multisurface method and the support vector machine in these experiments and the best from the literature illustrates the efficacy and the usefulness of the new MILP-based classification of data for supervised learning.

Not only must the players learn low-level skills, but they must also learn to work together and to adapt to the behaviors of different opponents. Dynamic behaviour learning in the face of adversarial opponents involves a) learning a basic set of strategies, and b) tuning these strategies for the specific opponents involved. Iterative approaches to dynamic learning are often slow for large state spaces, especially since in many dynamic situations, the reward is not obvious immediately, but may need to be temporally apportioned over multiple time epochs. In this work, we construct a reinforcement learning model based on a radial basis function network which may be interpreted as a set of fuzzy rules, and which are capable of real-time online learning. We test this method on the soccer-server domain that has emerged as an important testbed for learning dynamic behaviours. In addition to relatively simple behaviours such as goal scoring, we also learn multi-epoch behaviours such as pass interception in the presence of multiple opponents.

Machine learners are often used to classify network events as either normal or one of many attack categories. However, related studies have focused on classification models for intrusion detection without considering the ordinal relationship between the different classes. Ordinal data generally implies a clear, and often intuitive, ordering among the different categories for a given classification problem. We present results of an empirical study on ordinal classification for network intrusion detection. The real-world case study is that of a wireless local area network and consists of trace data collected over multiple weeks. Our study investigates ordinal vs. non-ordinal classification for intrusion detection for nine different learners, stemming from varied machine learning paradigms and theories. Our empirical results indicate that ordinal classification for intrusion detection generally yields better or similar performance than non-ordinal classification.

Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning	JUN 28-30, 2007	Alicante, SPAIN	Univ Alicante, Minist Educ Ciencia, Univ Alicante, Dept Lenguajes Sistemas Informat, Univ Alicante, Inst Univ Investigac Informat				Proper recognition and handling of temporal information contained in a text is key to understanding the flow of events depicted in the text and their accompanying circumstances. Consequently, time expression recognition and representation of the time information they convey in a suitable normalized form is an important task relevant to several problems in Natural Language Processing. In particular such an analysis is largely significant for Information Extraction (IE), Question Answering (QA) and Automatic Summarization (AS). The most common approach to time expression recognition in the past has been the use of handmade extraction rules (grammars), which also served as the basis for normalization. Our aim is to explore the possibilities afforded by applying machine learning techniques to the recognition of time expressions. We focus on recognizing the appearances of time expressions in text (not normalization) and transform the problem into one of chunking, where the aim is to correctly assign Begin, Inside or Outside (BIO) tags to tokens. In this paper; we explain the knowledge representation used and compare the results obtained in our experiments with two different methods, one statistical (support vector machines) and one of rule induction (FOIL). Our empirical analysis shows that SVMs are superior.	Tech Univ Catalonia UPC, TALP Res Ctr, Barcelona, Spain	Poveda, J (reprint author), Tech Univ Catalonia UPC, TALP Res Ctr, Barcelona, Spain.

A response model can be built as a decision model for the classification of a domain problem potential like expert systems. In this paper, a hybrid meta-evolutionary rule mining based approach is proposed to assess the total cholesterol data pattern detected from twelve meridians for extracting the decision rules including the predictors, the corresponding inequalities and parameters simultaneously so as to building a decision-making model with maximum classification accuracy. In real world, the diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine through the twelve meridians is highly complicated in nature so that it's hard to develop a comprehensive model. Recently, nonlinear and complex machine learning approaches such as neural networks and support vector machines have been demonstrated to be with more reliable than the conventional statistical approaches. The usefulness of using neural networks and support machines has been reported in literatures, but the most obstacles are in model building and use of model in which the classification rules are hard to be realized. Through the numerical experiment, we compared our results against the commercial data mining software, and then we show experimentally that the proposed approach is promising for improving prediction accuracy with fewer type II errors.

J	Bahi, H				Bahi, Halima			NESSR: a neural expert system for speech recognition	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article						artificial intelligence; machine learning; connectionism; speech recognition		Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have found applications in large spectrum of fields. Satisfactory results are obtained particularly in classification problems. In speech recognition context, the use of ANNs is hard, this is essentially due to the absence of the temporal aspect in their structure. On the other hand, assuming a speech recognition task, a word could be recognized and well categorized or recognized and badly categorized; so the explanation of the decision is very important. In this paper, we address two limitations of ANNs: the lack of explicit knowledge and the absence of temporal aspect in their implementation. STN: is a model of a specialized temporal neuron, which includes both symbolic and temporal aspects, To illustrate the STN utility, we consider a system for speech recognition; we underline in this paper the explanation aspect of the system.

For datasets containing noisy, inadequate or irrelevant information these algorithms may produce less accurate results. Therefore a common pre-processing step in data mining domain is a selection of highly predictive attributes. In this case study we select subsets of attributes from medical data using filter feature selection algorithms. To validate the algorithms we induce decision rules from the selected subsets of attributes and compare classification accuracy on both training and test datasets. Additionally medical relevance of the selected attributes is checked with help of domain experts.

The multi-layer Feedforward Neural Network provides a natural choice for pattern classification because it has been shown to be a universal approximator. However, the training process remains much to be a trial-and-error effort since no learning algorithm can guarantee convergence to global optimal solution within finite iterations. In this work, we introduce a network model which is linear in parameters to generate different combinations of hyperbolic basis functions to achieve some approximation and classification properties. This is to circumvent the iterative training problem as seen in layered neural network learning. With appropriate formulation and extension of a decision fusion model to cater for pattern classification; extensive experiments have been performed on three hyperbolic function networks using forty-two data sets from UCI. The results show that the proposed hyperbolic function networks have either comparable or better classification accuracies comparing with commonly used classifiers like SVM, neural networks, nearest neighbor and etc. Particularly, the hyperbolic tangent network scores top in classification accuracy across different data groups.

Training a SVM involves solving a constrained quadratic programming problem, which requires large memory and enormous amounts of training time for large-scale problems. In contrast; the SVM decision function is fully determined by a small subset of the training data, called support vectors. Therefore; it is desirable to remove from the training set data that are irrelevant to the final decision function. In this work we propose two new methods that select a subset of data for SVM training. Using real-world datasets, we compare the effectiveness of the proposed data selection strategies in terms of their ability to reduce the training set size while maintaining the generalization performance of the resulting SVM classifiers. Our experimental results show that a significant amount of training data can be removed by our proposed methods without degrading the performance of the resulting SVM classifiers.

Moreover, apart from inaccurate or untrustworthy information, we also need to anticipate web spam - where spammers publish false facts and scams to deliberately mislead users. Creating an effective spam detection method is a challenge. In this paper, we use the notion of content trust for spam detection, and regard it as a ranking problem. Evidence is utilized to define the feature of spam web pages, and machine learning techniques are employed to combine the evidence to create a highly efficient and reasonably-accurate spam detection algorithm. Experiments on real web data are carried out, which show the proposed method performs very well in practice.

We present a system for detection of disease patterns demonstrated on HRCT images of the lung. Automated image analysis can be assisted by, incorporating into a program information and knowledge that is available to radiologists. Anatomical features and landmarks are first extracted from the images. This information, together with the structure and regions of the lung, that are stored in a model of the lungs, is used in detecting disease patterns. Rules for recognizing different disease patterns are generated using machine learning. The system's performance is demonstrated on detecting two kinds of diseases patterns, one related to structural deformation of the bronchial tree and one showing fibrotic changes of the lung parenchyma. The results show that the system is able to recognize and indicate the existence, size and location of potential lung abnormalities.

Lymphoma is differentiated 133, the type of cell that multiplies and how the cancer presents itself. It is very important to get an exact diagnosis regarding lymphoma and to determine the treatments that will be most effective for the patient's condition. Our work was focused oil the identification of lymphomas by finding follicles in microscopy images provided by the Laboratory), of Pathology in the University Hospital of Tenerife, Spain. Roughly we can divide our work in two stages: in the first stage we did image pre-processing and feature extraction, and in the second stage we used different rough set approaches for pixel classification. These results were compared to decision tree results we obtained earlier. Symbolic machine learning approaches are often neglected when looking for image analysis tools. The results we got are very promising and show that symbolic approaches call be successful in image analysis applications.

While the aim of these two technologies is the same - the extraction of useful knowledge - little is known about how the two sources of knowledge can be integrated. This problem is especially important for biomedicine where relevant data are Often naturally complex having large dimensionality and including heterogeneous features. In this paper we propose an approach for improving the performance of machine learning by integrating the knowledge provided by ontologies for large-dimensional disease-specific heterogeneous data. The basic idea is to redefine the concept of similarity by incorporating available ontological knowledge. Benefits and difficulties of this integration are discussed and an example from the field of paediatric cardiology is described.

B	Yan, J; El Ahmad, AS			IEEE Computer Soc	Yan, Jeff; El Ahmad, Ahmad Salah			Breaking visual CAPTCHAs with naive pattern recognition algorithms	TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL COMPUTER SECURITY APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	23rd Annual Computer Security Applications Conference	DEC 10-14, 2007	Miami Beach, FL	Appl Comp Secur Associates				Visual CAPTCHAs have been widely used across the Internet to defend against undesirable or malicious bot programs. In this paper, we document how we have broken most such visual schemes provided at Captchaservice. org, a publicly available web service for CAPTCHA generation. These schemes were effectively resistant to attacks conducted using a high-quality Optical Character Recognition program, but were broken with a near 100% success rate by our novel attacks. In contrast to early work that relied on sophisticated computer vision or machine learning algorithms, we used simple pattern recognition algorithms but exploited fatal design errors that we discovered in each scheme. Surprisingly, our simple attacks can also break many other schemes deployed on the Internet at the time of writing: their design had similar errors. We also discuss defence against our attacks and new insights on the design of visual CAPTCHA schemes.

Many existing systems for detecting occupant activity require large numbers of sensors, invasive vision systems, or extensive installation procedures. We present an approach that uses a single plug-in sensor to detect a variety of electrical events throughout the home. This sensor detects the electrical noise on residential power lines created by the abrupt switching of electrical devices and the noise created by certain devices while in operation. We use machine learning techniques to recognize electrically noisy events such as turning on or off a particular light switch, a television set, or an electric stove. We tested our system in one home for several weeks and in five homes for one week each to evaluate the system performance over time and in different types of houses. Results indicate that we can learn and classify various electrical events with accuracies ranging from 85-90%.

The goal is to determine whether people have regular and recognizable patterns of interaction with objects as they perform such activities. We describe the use of a machine-learning algorithm to induce decision-trees that classify interaction patterns according to the subject who exhibited them; we consider which features of the sensor data have the most effect on classification accuracy; and we consider ways of reducing the computational complexity introduced by the most important feature type. Although our experiment is preliminary, the results are encouraging: we are able to do identification with an overall accuracy rate of 97%, including correctly recognizing each individual in at least 9 of 10 trials.

Our reasoning engine supports both rule-based reasoning and machine learning reasoning. Our main contribution is to utilize feature selection method to filter the low-level contexts which are not useful for certain special high-level context reasoning. As a result, rules and learning models in the reasoning engine's knowledge base are refined since useless context have been filtered. The merits of our proposed reasoning engine are described in details in this paper.

The platform named Distributed Embedded Intelligence Room (DEIR) has been constructed with embedded sensors, actuators and computing devices. All the devices are interconnected using five different physical networks. This platform aims to facilitate realistic data collection and online system performance evaluation. The multi-agent control system incorporating two machine learning algorithms, fuzzy inference and decision tree, has been designed to conform to DEIR architecture. Devices to be controlled are classified based on their possible output states and modelled separately by fuzzy inference agents and decision tree agents in the system. The multi-agent control system with hybrid intelligence shows 11% improvements on overall control accuracy and 84% improvements on learning time compared to its predecessor control system. The vast improvement on computational time shows suitability of the approach towards real-time, embedded applications.

In an effort to learn what makes a useful computer vision design tool, we created Eyepatch, a tool for designing camera-based interactions, and evaluated the Eyepatch prototype through deployment to students in an HCI course. This paper describes the lessons we learned about making computer vision more accessible, while retaining enough power and flexibility to be useful in a wide variety of interaction scenarios.

Information about seated Postures Could be used to help avoid adverse effects of sitting for long periods of time or to predict seated activities for a human-computer interface. Our system design displays accurate near-real-time classification performance on data from subjects on which the Posture recognition system was trained by using a set of carefully designed, subject-invariant signal features. By using a near-optimal sensor placement strategy, we keep the number of required sensors low thereby reducing cost and computational complexity. We evaluated the performance of our technology using a series of empirical methods including (1) cross-validation (classification accuracy of 87% for ten Postures using data from 31 sensors), and (2) a physical deployment Of Our system (78% classification accuracy using data from 19 sensors).

Therefore, to evaluate the accessibility of webpages, it should be checked whether the pages include layout-purpose < table > tags. Automated precise detection of layout-purpose < table > tags in HTML sources is still a research challenge because it requires further than simply checking whether specific tags and/or attributes of the tags are included in the sources. We propose a method for the detection that is based on machine learning. The proposed method derives a < table > tag classifier that deduces the purpose of a < table > tag: the classifier deduces whether a < table > tag is a layout-purpose one or a table-purpose one. We have developed a system that derives classification rules by ID3. The system derives a decision tree from a set of learning data (< table > tags of which the purposes are known) and classifies < table > tags in webpages under evaluation. Classification accuracy was evaluated by cross validation with 200 test data collected from the Web. Result of the evaluation revealed that 1) the tags can be roughly classified with attribute values of border, number of rows, number of tags that appear ahead of the < table > tag, and the nest of < table > tags (i.e., these attributes are more likely to appear in upper layers in decision trees), and 2) the accuracy rates are about 90% for the 200 test data.

There currently exist fielded remote controlled UGVs and high altitude UAV whose benefits are based on standoff in low complexity environments that require sufficiently low control reaction time to allow for teleoperation. While effective within there limited operational niche such systems do not meet with the vision of future military UxV scenarios. Such scenarios envision unmanned vehicles operating effectively in complex environments and situations with high levels of independence and effective coordination with other machines and humans pursing high level, changing and, ZD sometimes conflicting goals. While these aims are clearly ambitious they do provide necessary targets and inspiration with hopes of fielding near term useful semi-autonomous unmanned systems. Autonomy involves many fields of research including machine vision, artificial intelligence, control theory, machine learning, and distributed systems all of which are intertwined and have goals of creating more versatile broadly applicable algorithms. Cohort is a major Applied Research Program (ARP) led by Defence R&D Canada (DRDC) Suffield and its aim is to develop coordinated teams of unmanned vehicles (UxVs) for urban environments. This paper will discuss the critical science being addressed by DRDC developing semi-autonomous systems.

Evaluating a simulated student using real students data for training and testing	User Modeling 2007, Proceedings	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on User Modeling	JUN 25-29, 2007	Corfu, GREECE	Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos, Ionian Univ, User Modeling Inc				SimStudent is a machine-learning agent that learns cognitive skills by demonstration. It was originally developed as a building block of the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT), so that the authors do not have to build a cognitive model by hand, but instead simply demonstrate solutions for SimStudent to automatically generate a cognitive model. The SimStudent technology could then be used to model human students' performance as well. To evaluate the applicability of SimStudent as a tool for modeling real students, we applied SimStudent to a genuine learning log gathered from classroom experiments with the Algebra I Cognitive Tutor. Such data can be seen as the human students' "demonstrations" of how to solve problems. The results from an empirical study show that SimStudent can indeed model human students' performance. After training on 20 problems solved by a group of human students, a cognitive model generated by SimStudent explained 82% of the problem-solving steps performed correctly by another group of human students.

Similarity between users is computed by comparing their rating styles, i.e. the set of ratings given on the same items. Unfortunately, similarity between users is computable only if they have common rated items. The main contribution of this paper is a (content-collaborative) hybrid recommender system which overcomes this limitation by computing similarity between users on the ground of their content-based profiles. Traditional keyword-based profiles are unable to capture the semantics of user interests, due to the natural language ambiguity. A distinctive feature of the proposed technique is that a statistical model of the user interests is obtained by machine learning techniques integrated with linguistic knowledge contained in the WordNet lexical database. This model, called the semantic user profile, is exploited by the hybrid recommender in the neighborhood formation process. The results of an experimental session in a movie recommendation scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

When a web server is overloaded there is a significant loss of throughput when we compare finished sessions and the number of responses per second; longer sessions are usually the ones ending in sales but also the most sensitive to load failures. Session-based admission control systems maintain a high QoS for a limited number of sessions, but does not maximize revenue as it treats all non-logged sessions the same. We present a novel method for learning to assign priorities to sessions according to the revenue that will generate. For this, we use traditional machine learning techniques and Markov-chain models. We are able to train a system to estimate the probability of the user's purchasing intentions according to its early navigation clicks and other static information. The predictions can be used by admission control systems to prioritize sessions or deny them if no resources are available, thus improving sales throughput per unit of time for a given infrastructure. We test our approach on access logs obtained from a high-traffic online travel agency, with promising results.

In conformance with this architecture, a toolkit, FemaRepViz, has been implemented to extract and visualize temporal, geospatial, and summarized information from FEMA National Update Reports. Preliminary tests have shown satisfactory accuracy for FEMARepViz. A central component of the architecture is an entity extractor that extracts named entities like person names, location names, temporal references, etc. FEMARepViz is based on FactXtractor, an entity-extractor that. works on text documents. The information extracted using FactXtractor is processed using GeoTagger, a geographical name disambiguation tool based on a novel clustering-based disambiguation algorithm. To extract relationships among entities, we propose a machine-learning based algorithm that uses a novel stripped dependency tree kernel. We illustrate and evaluate the usefulness Of Our system on the FEMA National Situation Updates. Daily reports are fetched by FEMARepViz from the FEMA website, segmented into coherent sections and each section is classified into one of several known incident types. We use ConceptVista, Google Maps and Google Earth to visualize the events extracted from the text reports and allow the user to interactively filter the topics, locations, and time-periods of interest to create a visual analytics toolkit that is useful for rapid analysis of events reported in a large set of text documents.

The complexity of the codec makes it difficult to use all its features in resource constrained mobile devices. This paper presents a machine learning approach to reducing the complexity of Intra encoding in H.264. Determining the macro block coding mode requires substantial computational resources in H.264 video encoding. The goal of this work to reduce MB mode computation from a search operation, as is done in the encoders today, to a computation. We have developed a methodology based on machine learning that computes the MB coding mode instead of searching for the best match thus reducing the complexity of Intra 16x16 coding by 17 times and Intra 4x4 MB coding by 12.5 times. The proposed approach uses simple mean value metrics at the block level to characterize the coding complexity of a macro block. A generic J4.8 classifier is used to build the decision trees to quickly determine the mode. We present a methodology for Intra NM coding. The results show that intra MB mode can be determined with over 90% accuracy. The proposed can also be used for determining MB prediction modes with an accuracy varying between 70% and 80%.

In the learning step, an object of interest is tracked while learning is performed from segmented frames. In the recognition step, target is tracked until favorable conditions allow identification. This tool is used in the, context of the Aqu@theque project which includes an automatic fish recognition system. Tracking is a difficult task especially in case of real world images. Particle filtering methods incorporating motion based segmentation measurement in importance sampling step improve performance.

Machine learning provides a firm theoretical foundation upon which to build techniques that leverage existing data to extract interesting information or to synthesize more data. In this paper we survey the uses of machine learning methods and concepts in recent computer graphics techniques. Many graphics techniques are data-driven; however, few graphics papers explicitly leverage the machine learning literature to underpin, validate, and develop their proposed methods. This survey provides novel insights by casting many existing computer graphics techniques into a common learning framework. This not only illuminates how these techniques are related, but also reveals possible ways in which they may be improved. We also use our analysis to propose several directions for future work.

The domain user mustthen tune the system: select the right component to be executed and correctly adjust their numerous "knobs" (e.g., thresholds, formula coefficients). Tuning is skill and time intensive, but (as we show) without it the matching accuracy is significantly inferior. We describe eTuner, an approach to automatically tune schema matching systems. Given a schema S, we match S against synthetic schemas, for which the ground truth mapping is known, and find a tuning that demonstrably improves the performance of matching S against real schemas. To efficiently search the huge space of tuning configurations, eTuner works sequentially, starting with tuning the lowest level components. To increase the applicability of eTuner, we develop methods to tune a broad range of matching components. While the tuning process is completely automatic, eTuner can also exploit user assistance (whenever available) to further improve the tuning quality. We employed eTuner to tune four recently developed matching systems on several real-world domains. The results show that eTuner produced tuned matching systems that achieve higher accuracy than using the systems with currently possible tuning methods.

Typically such estimation is performed using thermocouples; however, these sensors are intrusive and must undergo the harsh furnace environment. In this paper, we follow a machine learning approach to learn the relation between the spectroscopic measurements and gas constituents such as temperature, concentration and length. This is a challenging problem due to the non-linear behavior of the RTE and the high dimensional data obtained from sensor measurements. We perform a comparative study of linear and neural network regression models, using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), principal component analysis (PCA), reduced rank regression(RRR), and kernel canonical correlation (KCCA) to reduce the dimensionality.

Two over-segmentations (OS) of a dataset are achieved and then fused to determine the best-possible initial means to perform the iterative process of k-means. The method is tested over both, image as well as non-image data. The image data is segmented using texture features based on Gabor energy features (GEF). The method is compared with single-run k-means and k-means with multiple restarts. Encouraging results have been obtained while segmenting a variety of texture images and the non-image data. The 40% OS is found to give the best results. This technique addresses the issue of data clustering in all the possible areas including data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning and statistics.

Within past years, numerous face recognition algorithms have been proposed by researchers. However, there is no evidence that shows one specific proposed method is the best under all circumstances. So, a combination of several methods can be a good approach. Committee machine structures, which were introduced in the machine learning community, show some ways to combine different methods in a single framework. A committee machine structure makes decision according to its components. In the previous face recognition methods with committee machines, only the information which is extracted from test phase is used for Combining classifiers. In this paper, in addition to the information in test phase, training phase information is used for combining classifiers. For this purpose, we introduce a new unit which is called "Region Finder". This unit is attached to each classifier in a committee machine structure and is learned based on train phase information. A region finder determines its classifier recognition power in the classifier feature space. We applied our idea to a structure of five well-known classifiers, PCA, ICA, LDA, SVM and neural networks which are implemented for face recognition. Comparative experimental results of our committee machine with different algorithms and the structure without region finder units, demonstrate that the proposed system achieves improved accuracy.

Our approach to provide universal and personalized access lies on combining user modelling and machine learning techniques to cope with the needs for ALL with a pervasive support of standards and supporting the full life cycle of service adaptation. The modelling differs from others in i) coping with interactions and context of the user that can only be considered at runtime and ii) characterising interaction capabilities of different kinds of devices. Models are used to personalize and adapt learning materials, pedagogical settings and interactions in the environment to satisfy both the individual learning needs and the access preferences, taking into account the context at hand.

In this paper, we present MCMA, a mediator-centric mapping architecture that facilitates the integration between ontologies of interrelated companies. In MCMA, different ontologies are mapped through some middle concepts and the Mapping Service acts as a bridge to connect them. As a mediator, the provider of Mapping Service is interested in a specific area and offers some common ontologies for participators to reuse. On the assumption that each individual ontology may reuse or make reference to common definitions, some mapping relations can be defined conveniently. Based on these basic mapping relations, the Mapping Service infers more middle-concept oriented mapping relations and organizes them in a layered manner. We present the idea of combining heuristics or machine-learning techniques with common ontology approach in the mapping discovery.

Established approaches have to be enhanced and new methods be developed in order to tackle the problem of finding and organising relevant information. It has often been motivated that semantic classifications of input documents help solving this task. But while approaches of supervised text categorisation perform quite well on genres found in written text, newly evolved genres on the web are much more demanding. In order to successfully develop approaches to web mining, respective corpora are needed. However, the composition of genre- or domain-specific web corpora is still an unsolved problem. It is time consuming to build large corpora of good quality because web pages typically lack reliable meta information. Wikipedia along with similar approaches of collaborative text production offers a way out of this dilemma. We examine how social tagging, as supported by the MediaWiki software, can be utilised as a source of corpus building. Further, we describe a representation format for social ontologies and present the Wikipedia Category Explorer, a tool which supports categorical views to browse through the Wikipedia and to construct domain specific corpora for machine learning.

Fuzzy entropy has been used to extrapolate the data pertaining to the compressor current. Certain attributes related to the compressor current have been considered. Test data of compressor current used in this knowledge discovery algorithm knows the entire attribute clearly. The developed algorithm is very effective and can be used in the various application related to knowledge discovery and machine learning. The developed knowledge discovery algorithm using fuzzy entropy has been tested on a multi-compressor system for incomplete compressor current data and it is found that the error level is merely +/- 4.40%, which is far better than other available knowledge discovery algorithms.

This support tool has been tailored for the early engineering design stages, where the nature of the design problem is ill-structured and has traditionally relied on the designer's tacit domain expertise. The BBN enables a designer to interactively explore the design space. The BBN is efficiently induced from a database of prior design exemplars using a novel information content metric to greedily construct the causal graph structure. The method is illustrated using a conceptual car design domain.	Univ Durham, Sch Engn, Durham DH1 3LE, England	Matthews, PC (reprint author), Univ Durham, Sch Engn, Durham DH1 3LE, England.

It provides for the organization of a collection of patterns, represented as a vector in a multidimensional space, into clusters based on the similarity of these patterns. Medical decision support is also of increasing research interest. Ongoing collaborations between cardiovascular clinicians and computer science are looking at the application of neural networks, and in particular clustering, to the area of individual patient diagnosis, based on clinical records. The cardiovascular domain is characterized as a mixture of continuous and discrete data. This limits the use of the K-means algorithm, which is widely used for partitioning clusters in data mining. This paper presents an improvement on the K-means algorithm (KMIX) grid allows. its application to the mixture of attribute types found in the cardiovascular domain.

Although our work was in the area of manufacturing quality the technique is applicable to free form, short text summaries of data that may be stored in a database, file, or document. We refer to these types of text as "technical text passages". These summaries may not follow standard grammar conventions; they commonly contain abbreviations, technical phrases, misspelled words and industry specific acronyms. Typical types of text to be classified include aircraft engine repair shop findings, industrial manufacturing quality problems and corrective actions, and standardization of attributes in a bill-of-materials. In this paper, we will present our results in using machine learning and rule based algorithms to categorize text. Our results show that the rules based approach is as good as several machine learning approaches. For example, using Support Vector Machine algorithms we were able to achieve 82% accuracy on validation set, using 1,645 training samples and 823 validation samples. Each category had 50 or more samples. Using rule-based approach we were able to achieve 80% accuracy.

In our implementation, we use two simple machine learning techniques: one for classifying the ECG form and the other for recognizing a required set of attribute values depending on the scanned form. In order to classify an ECG form, as a training step, we built an average histogram for each ECG form using a pre-classified set of training data. A newly scanned image is assigned to the form that is in nearest distance on its histogram. To recognize a set of important attribute values, we used a multi-layered neural network and back propagation algorithm normally used in OCR. ECG sheets differ in layout and thus attributes. We analyzed each form of ECG sheets and constructed an XML file representing a set of attributes whose values are to be recognized later on. We have tested our system with a number of sheets printed from six different ECG devices including 12-lead ECG and Treadmill. When a 12-lead ECG sheet is scanned by a high-speed scanner, for instance, its image is classified and saved into the corresponding class, and a major set of attribute values is recognized and saved in the system's database; in our case, we use the attributes such as the patient's number, test date and time, Rate, PR, QRSD, QT, QTc, Axis (P, QRS, T).

The application of electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential for the clinical diagnosis of cardiac diseases. The use of computers for accurately and quickly cardiac disease diagnosis has been a subject fervently pursued by both internal and external researchers. Therefore, it is great significant to explore even more accurate and higher-speed automatic ECG analysis method. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a novel powerful machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, which is powerful for the characterization of small sample (nonlinearity, high dimension and local minima). In this paper, Clinical diagnosis of cardiac disease based on SVM is proposed. There are two input patterns of samples: 8-lead ECG in series and in parallel. All experiments are implemented on Pentium 350 MHz with 512 MB RAM. Matlab 6.5 is employ to solve the quadratic programming. Comparison in two input patterns based on SVM, the result shows that SVM method in parallel is highly reliable and accurate. It will have great potential application in clinical diagnosis.

Proposed gait-event detection system consists of a signal measurement part and gait event detection part. To make the system portable, we made following modifications from the previous wired system. That is, 1) to make the system wireless using Bluetooth communication, 2) to make the system small-sized and battery-powered by using low power consumption microprocessor. We also used a video camera system to get the reference gait events. The gait-events were detected offline at the main computer using ANN(Artificial Neural Network) of Machine learning technique. The proposed system showed no mis-detection of the gait-events of normal subject and hemiplegia subjects. The performance of the system was better than the previous wired-system, probably due to the reduction of unnatural movement during gait signal measurement. It is expected that the result of this study will be useful in the design of cycle-to-cycle FES controller.

This is accomplished by employing a wavelet-based multiscale analysis. After the data has been wavelet-transformed unsupervised machine learning methods are employed to identify typical patterns in the wavelet domain. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach we apply a filtering procedure that extracts the wavelet-based image information related to tumour tissue. In this way we obtain a robust segmentation of suspicious tissue in the MR image.

The application domain is the psychotherapeutic treatment of anorectic young women. The three methods are supposed to support the therapists in finding the variables which influence success or failure of the therapy. To conduct the evaluation we developed a report system which helped subjects to formulate and document in a self-directed manner the insights they gained when using the three methods. The results indicate that the three methods are complementary and should be used in conjunction.

Dividing lung surface into multiple parts according to its anatomical features provides better understanding of the lung and its functions. The paper presents an automatic classification of the lung surface on high-resolution CT images. The entire lung surface is divided into four classes according to the parietal pleura surrounding the lung. 2D shape analysis in multiple views is used to detect the pleural reflection lines, which divide lung surface into smaller sections. Two machine learning classifier, namely C4.5 and ripple-down rules (RDR) are used to classify the surface sections. After trained with 30 real patient scans and tested with 10 scans, the results show that the method is able to classify the lung surface with 92% accuracy.

Honeycombing is difficult to detect due to its textural and structural appearance, which changes with the progression of the diseases. Structure-based and texture-based methods, developed for detecting the honeycombing pattern, are presented and compared. Machine learning is used to generate rules for honeycomb detection using examples of its appearance in HRCT images, provided by radiologists. The effectiveness of each method was evaluated using cross validation on 16692 examples of regions with and without honeycombing from 42 images of 8 patients.

In activity recognition, machine learning techniques have been widely applied to learn the activity models from labeled activity samples. Since labeling samples requires human's efforts, most existing research in activity recognition focus on refining learning techniques to utilize the costly labeled samples as effectively as possible. However, few of them consider using the costless unlabeled samples to boost learning performance. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm named En-Co-training to make use of the unlabeled samples. Our algorithm extends the co-training paradigm by using ensemble method. Experimental results show that En-Co-training is able to utilize the available unlabeled samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number of labeled samples.

For each video sequence of the person, we approximately align each frame in the sequence and then generate a set of features that captures the differences between the two sequences. The features are the occupancy difference map, the codeword frequency difference map (based on a vector quantization of the set of colors and frequencies) at each aligned pixel and the histogram intersection map. A boosting technique is then applied to learn the most discriminative set of features, and these features are then used to train a support vector machine classifier to recognize significant appearance changes. We apply our approach to the problem of left package detection. We train the classifiers on a laboratory database of videos in which people are seen with and without common articles that people carry - backpacks and suitcases. We test the approach on some real airport video sequences. Moving to the real world videos requires addressing additional problems, including the view selection problem and the frame selection problem.

As a result, comparison-based algorithms that solve such problems use comparison functions that are imperfect (i.e. they may make errors). Machine learning algorithms that search for game-playing programs are typically imperfect comparison algorithms. This paper presents M(2)ICAL, an algorithm analysis tool that uses Monte Carlo simulations to derive a Markov Chain model for Imperfect Comparison Algorithms. Once an algorithm designer has modeled an algorithm using M(2)ICAL as a Markov chain, it can be analyzed using existing Markov chain theory. Information that can be extracted from the Markov chain include the estimated solution quality after a given number of iterations; the standard deviation of the solutions' quality; and the time to convergence.

Software effort estimation using machine learning techniques with robust confidence intervals	19TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL I, PROCEEDINGS	Proceedings-International Conference on Tools With Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	OCT 29-31, 2007	Patras, GREECE	IEEE Comp Soc, Biol & Artificial Intelligence Soc, Univ Patras, Wright State Univ, ATRC			SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION	The precision and reliability of the estimation of the effort of software projects is very important for the competitiveness of software companies. Good estimates play a very important role in the management of software projects. Most methods proposed for effort estimation, including methods based on machine learning, provide only an estimate of the effort for a novel project. In this paper we introduce a method based on machine learning which gives the estimation of the effort together with a confidence interval for it. In our method, we propose to employ robust confidence intervals, which do not depend on the form of probability distribution of the errors in the training set. We report on a number of experiments using two datasets aimed to compare machine learning techniques for software effort estimation and to show that robust confidence intervals for the effort estimation can be successfully built.

The bottleneck of kNN is it needs a good similarity measure which could be problematic in some cases especially for datasets containing categorical data. In this paper, a partial coverage based classificaiton (PCC) method is proposed which works without similarity measure and conversion for categorical data. Moreover, the PCC method is easy to be implemented. Experiments were carried out on some public datasets collected from the UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the proposed method is better than some classical classificaiton algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. The PCC is a quite promising method for classification.

In order to achieve this, we employ two approaches towards the acquisition and exploitation of the desired qualitative aspects of the synthesis on behalf of the designer. Our work concerns the adaptation and application of a machine learning technique, as well as of an evolutionary search method, in the current context. The former refers to the gradual construction of a preference model, comprising an incrementally learning mechanism based on actual designer solution evaluation during regular system use. The latter approach models qualitative aspects through a multi-objective genetic algorithm variation based on the weighted sum method. The algorithm is applied during the generation and understanding phases of Declarative Modeling. This work provides evidence of performance improvement of declarative scene synthesis at the expense of additional designer feedback.

The nonlinear mapping between different data points in primitive time series is derived and proven. Our definition of turning points produces an event characterization function, which can transform the profile of time series to a measure. The RBF neural network is further used as a nonlinear modeler. We discuss the threshold selection and give a procedure for threshold estimation using out-of-sample validation. The proposed approach is applied to the prediction problem of two real-world financial time series. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our new approach.

The price for this convenience is a large number of compliant geometric models, only a small subset of which is usually of practical interest for the designer. The task of solution evaluation can be tedious and time-consuming whereas the qualities that make these solutions stand out are not always straightforward. In the current work we outline the integration of a machine learning component, trained by user-approved solutions of previous descriptions, with a reconstruction component, able to discover relations and properties implied by the best solutions, into a unique module for description adaptation according to user preferences.

CP gives good accuracy and confidence values, but unfortunately it is quite computationally inefficient. This computational inefficiency problem becomes huge when CP is coupled with a method that requires long training times, such as Neural Networks. In this paper we use a modification of the original CP method, called Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), which allows us to construct a Neural Network confidence predictor without the massive computational overhead of CP The method we propose accompanies its predictions with confidence measures that are useful in practice, while still preserving the computational efficiency of its underlying Neural Network.

However, the high dimensionality of graph grammars result in costly effort for their construction and maintenance. Additionally, they are often error prone. These costs limit the research potential for studying the growing graph based data in many fields. As interest in applications for natural languages and data mining has increased, the machine learning of graph grammars poses a prime area of research. A unified graph grammar construction, parsing, and inference tool is proposed. Existing technologies can provide a context-free tool. However, a general context-sensitive tool has been elusive. Using existing technologies for graph grammars, a tool for the construction and parsing of context-sensitive graph grammars is combined with a tool for inducing context-free graph grammars. The system is extended with novel work to infer context-sensitive graph grammars.

In particular we apply well established machine learning approaches to the WCL-1 prosodic database for predicting segmental durations from shallow morphosyntactic and prosodic features. We employ decision trees, instance based learning and linear regression. Trained on a 5500 word database, both CART and linear regression models proved to be the most effective in terms for the task with a root mean square error of 0.0252 and 0.0251 respectively.

Evolutionary selection of kernels in Support Vector Machines	2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications	DEC 20-23, 2006	Mangalore, INDIA	IEEE				A machine learning algorithm using evolutionary algorithms and Support Vector Machines is presented. The kernel function of support vector machines are evolved using recently introduced Gene Expression Programming algorithms. This technique trains a support vector machine with the kernel function most suitable for the training data set rather than pre-specifying the kernel function. The fitness of the kernel is measured by calculating cross validation accuracy. SVM trained with the fittest kernels is then used to classify previously unseen data. The algorithm is elucidated using preliminary case studies for classification of cancer data and bank transaction data set It is shown that the Evolutionary Support Vector Machine has good generalization properties when compared with Support Vector Machines using standard (polynomial and radial basis) kernel functions.

Over the years, efforts have been made to improve the detection and recognition performance of the biometric systems, and at the same time reduce the processing time of the systems for a faster identification. One of the approaches for performance optimization is to fuse two or more biometric matcher technologies to add on to the performance of the individual systems. In the present paper, we propose a new step integration based fusion method for multimodal biometric technologies, based upon eliminative machine learning. The individual matcher systems are integrated in steps eliminating unwanted user classes at each matcher step. The method achieves high accuracies and recognition rates, achieving low processing times at the same time. We compare our approach with simple sum fusion technique because of the simplicity and high accuracy rates associated with the simple sum method.

There are two issues to be considered for classification in Polarimetric SAR image analysis: (1) how to choose the measurement with discriminability on various categories with different scattering characteristics; (2) how to combine the classifier sets with minimum loss of performance. For solving both the problems, the authors propose a supervised classification method Firstly, the result of the optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement (OPCE) is employed as the distance measurement. Then the measurement is translated to a confidence rate, which describes the decision of a "weak" classifier on a refined scale. These classifiers are generated and combined to a powerful classier under the boosting framework. This proposed method takes advantages of both the specific characteristics of polarimetric SAR image and of the powerful machine learning algorithm. Using polarimetric SAR image, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The most important factor affecting the budget of a project is the effort. Therefore, estimating effort is crucial because hiring people more than needed leads to a loss of income and hiring people less than needed leads to an extension of schedule. The main objective of this research is making an analysis of software effort estimation to overcome problems related to it: budget and schedule extension. To accomplish this, we propose a model that uses machine learning methods. We evaluate these models on public datasets and data gathered from software organizations in Turkey It is found out in the experiments that the best method for a dataset may change and this proves the point that the usage of one model cannot always produce the best results.

Bagging, boosting and voting methods are the basic examples of ensemble learning. In this study, a novel boosting technique targeting to solve partial problems of AdaBoost, a well-known boosting algorithm, is proposed. The proposed system finds an elegant way of boosting a bunch of classifiers successively to form a "better classifier" than each ensembled classifiers. AdaBoost algorithm employs a greedy search over hypothesis space to find a "good" suboptimal solution. On the hand, the system proposed employs an evolutionary search with genetic algorithms instead of greedy search. Empirical results show that classification with boosted evolutionary computing outperforms the classical AdaBoost in equivalent experimental environments.

In order to cope with this pressure, software developers seek new approaches to manage the development cycle: to finish on time, within budget and with no defects. Software defect prediction is one area that has to be focused to lower the cost of testing as well as to improve the quality of the end product. Defect prediction has been widely studied for software systems in general, however there are very few studies which specifically target embedded software. This paper examines defect prediction techniques from an embedded software point of view. We present the results of combining several machine learning techniques for defect prediction. We believe that the results of this study will guide us in finding better predictors and models for this purpose.

An accurate evaluation of machine learning algorithms for flow-based P2P traffic detection	2007 22ND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences	NOV 07-09, 2007	Ankara, TURKEY					Today, peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic consumes the largest fraction of network bandwidth. The files shared by P2P communications are mostly copyright protected, and there are issues related to Quality of Service (QoS) support and billing of P2P traffic. Hence, scalable and accurate detection of peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic is a significant problem for network service providers. Flow-based detection methods employ characteristics of data flows such as the number of packets per flow to classify P2P and non-P2P traffic. Thus, they provide solutions to problems of port-based and signature-based detection such as P2P applications with dynamic ports, updating the signature database and encrypted packets. In this paper, a comparative evaluation of several flow-based P2P traffic detection methods that employ machine learning (ML) techniques is presented. Different from previous work, the effect of network parameters is taken into consideration in our evaluation. Furthermore a new verification approach based on custom-made data is presented which can circumvent the accuracy problems of the previous verification methods that use port-based or signature-based techniques for the accuracy evaluation.

We combine sparse Bayesian machine learning methods with the state of the art SAGE-based parameter estimation algorithm. Existing sparse Bayesian methods allow to assess model order through priors over model parameters, but do not consider models nonlinear in parameters. SAGE-based parameter estimation does allow nonlinear model structures, but lacks a mechanism for model order estimation. Here we show how Gaussian and Laplace priors can be applied to enforce sparsity and determine the model order in case of superimposed signals, as well as develop an EM-based learning algorithm that efficiently estimate parameters of the superimposed signals as well as prior parameters that control the sparsity of the learned models. Our work extends the existing approaches to complex data and models nonlinear in parameters. We also present new analytical and empirical studies of the Laplace sparsity priors applied to complex data. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed using synthetic data.

Scalable tracking and dissemination of presence attributes, across multiple communication channels, is a critical requirement for future IMS-based converged network architectures. This paper presents PASTA (Presence Advanced Services for Telco Applications), an enhancement to a Presence Server that employs scalable, rule-based event correlation middleware and machine-learning engines, to automatically derive higher-level, "semantically richer" presence information about individual or multiple presentities. By augmenting the event store of the Presence Server with such "rich presence", PASTA enables applications and users to subscribe to presence notifications at higher-levels of abstraction. Such abstractions could significantly reduce the volume of network traffic resulting from low-level presence updates, but also promote privacy preferences by permitting presentities to control the exposure of raw presence information. We describe the design, implementation and performance analysis of PASTA and discuss open future issues associated with "rich presence".

The platform was developed at the University of Tennessee for use in a course on reinforcement learning. Using this software interface, students were able to easily implement machine learning schemes and apply them to the Sony AIBO robot, a flexible platform with diverse capabilities. The behavior development process for the AIBO is traditionally limited to programming in a C++ environment. To avoid the overhead of such tedious programming, the Matlab interface was designed to allow the user to both implement functions and behaviors already developed for the AIBO, as well as to construct new behaviors using existing components as building blocks. Moreover, since the interface relies on a bidirectional network socket connection, the user is offered full control of the robot from any (remote) networked computer.

Visual input from a standard color camera delivers high-resolution texture data but also enables us to enhance the 3D data calculated from the range output of a 3D time-of-flight camera in terms of noise and spatial resolution. The proposed method to increase the visual quality of the 3D data makes this kind of camera a promising device for various upcoming 3DTV applications. With our two-camera setup we believe that the design of lowcost, fast and highly portable 3D scene acquisition systems will be possible in the near future.

As improved combinatorial labeling methods allow simultaneous measurement of gene activities to expand from five genes in a single embryo or tissue section to upward of twenty genes, transforming image stacks into usable data becomes an increasingly labor intensive task. In this paper we describe our progress towards a method for the computational analysis of confocal images from Drosophila melanogastar that involves the segmentation of the cell nuclei and of nascent transcription sites of specific genes. Using image processing and machine learning algorithms, we allow experimentalists to reiteratively tune and improve the analysis system to reflect biological reality.

It is now sufficiently accurate that clinically significant polyps 1 cm and larger can be reliably detected with 90% sensitivity. The research focus is now shifting to improving sensitivity for detection of smaller polyps, reducing the number of false positive detections, integrating CAD into clinical practice and applying CAD to the setting of fecal tagging and laxative-free bowel preparations.

However, occult damage of brain tissue has been investigated through magnetization transfer imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this paper, we discriminate patients with NMO from healthy subjects based on the two-dimensional histogram of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the brain derived from DTI. The correct recognition rate is 89.5%, validated by the leave-one-out method. This result was much higher than that using one feature separately (68.4% for FA, 73.7% for ADC). Eigenimages, which reflect the discriminative pattern of NMO patients from healthy subjects, are also generated. Diffuse damage in brain tissue of NMO is detected from these eigenimages. In conclusion, the information from two-dimensional histogram can discriminate NMO patients from healthy subjects. Moreover, eigenimages can to some extent reflect discriminative regions between NMO patients and normal controls, and these discriminative regions will be useful in understanding the mechanism of NMO.

Retrieval-driven microcalcification classification for breast cancer diagnosis	2007 4TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING : MACRO TO NANO, VOLS 1-3	IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	APR 12-15, 2007	Arlington, VA	IEEE		mammogram retrieval; numerical observer; adaptive SVM; classification		In this paper, a content-based mammogram retrieval system is developed and evaluated to improve the performance of both human and numerical observers in breast cancer diagnosis. We previously developed a machine learning approach for modeling the similarity measure between two lesion mammograms from expert observer studies for mammogram retrieval. In this work we investigate how to use the retrieved similar cases as references to improve a numerical classifier's performance. The ratinale is that by adaptively incorporating proximity information to the cost function of a classifier, it can help to improve the classification accuracy, thereby leading to an improved "second opinion" to radiologists. Our experiment results on a mammogram database demonstrate that the proposed retrieval-driven approach with an adaptive support vector machine (SVM) could improve the classification performance from 0.78 to 0.82 in terms of the area under the ROC curve.

A parallel architecture for temporal difference learning with eligibility traces	2007 50TH MIDWEST SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-3	Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	50th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems	SEP 05-AUG 08, 2007-2008	Montreal, CANADA	RESMIQ, IEEE, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc, Hardent, Technol, Ecole Polytech Montreal				Temporal difference learning is a central idea in reinforcement learning, commonly employed by a broad range of applications, in which there are delayed rewards. An agent learns by interacting with its environment and constructs a value function which helps map states to actions. A particularly useful tool in temporal difference learning is eligibility traces. The latter assist the agent in assigning values to states recently visited. This paper explores the gain attainable by utilizing custom hardware to take advantage of the inherent parallelism found in the TD(lambda) algorithm. The result is a scalable framework for high-speed machine learning applications. To the best of that authors' knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to map tabular-form temporal difference learning with eligibility traces on to digital hardware.

Recently, some works devoted to SVM-based ensembles report that the most popular ensembles creation methods Bagging and Adaboost are not expected to improve the performance of SVMs and sometimes they even worsen the performance, due to that SVM is stable and strong classifier. In this paper, we focus on adapting Bagging and Adaboost to SVM. The framework of Bagging is extended by introducing the Class-wise expert classifiers, then we proposed the improved algorithm CeBag. The weighting rule of AdaBoost is modified to deal with the overfitting problem which may be even worse when boosting strong classifiers, and the strength of SVM is weakened by adaptively adjusting the kernel parameters, then we proposed the algorithm WwBoost. Experiments implemented on IDA benchmark data sets show that our algorithms are effective in building ensemble of SVMs.	[Wang, Yu; De Lin, Cheng] Xiamen Univ, Dept Automat, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China	Wang, Y (reprint author), Xiamen Univ, Dept Automat, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.

In this paper, we investigate machine learning techniques for tongue diagnosis. To do this, we first identify tongue properties and classes. In tongue property identification, we identify 21 properties from tongue substance and coating, whereas in tongue classification, we derive 24 tongue classes. Machine learning techniques are then applied to a tongue dataset. In performance analysis, we use the Weka machine learning environment for conducting the experiment. Five different machine learning algorithms including 1133, J48, Naive Bayes, BayesNet and SMO are used and applied to a tongue dataset of 457 instances. The performance results have shown that the Support Vector Machine algorithm SMO has the best performance for tongue diagnosis based on accuracy and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).

Companies must develop the necessary infrastructure to derive valid product configurations that satisfy the requirements of lifecycle cost along with customer's constraints. In this paper, to overcome the drawback of current product configurators, we apply a rule mining approach to automatically generate configuration knowledge, and present a hybrid approach based on Activity Based Costing (ABC) and machine learning techniques to estimate LCC of derived product variants from a constraint-based configurator at the design stage. The proposed intelligent techniques would benefit companies in enhancing product development capability in a shorter lifecycle.

These sensors are usually characterized by limited communication capabilities due to energy and bandwidth constraints. As a result, WSNs have inspired resurgence in research on machine learning methodologies with the objective of overcoming the physical constraints of sensors. In this paper, machine learning methods that have been applied in WSNs to solve some networking and application problems are surveyed. Fundamental limits of learning algorithms will be addressed and future machine learning research direction are highlighted.

In particular, we discuss the characteristics of the acoustic profiles of two target groups of insects: crickets and cicadas. Subsequently, we employ advanced machine learning techniques to categorize them on the levels of specific insect, family, subfamily, genus, and species. To deal with the sparse spectral representation of some species, we adopt a score-level fusion of classifiers with non-parametric (probabilistic neural network) and parametric (Gaussian mixture models) estimation of the probability density function. We apply this approach to a large and well documented catalogue of cricket and cicada recordings, and we report identification accuracy that exceeds 99% on the levels of singing insect and family, and 90% on the level of a species out of 220 species.

The main idea is to use the notion of predictability as a basis for dependency definition. Considering any nonlinear regression function between two random variables, the power of regression residuals or noise variance defines the desired dependency measure. The residuals variance can be directly computed by estimators without finding the best fit curve. The paper shows the conditions on which two random variables are independent according to the estimated residuals variance. The existence of residual variance, or noise variance estimators make it possible to define such practical measure for dependency. The dependency measure finds wide areas of applications in signal processing and machine learning. In this paper, solutions for Independent Component Analysis and input selection using the proposed dependency measure are discussed.

Usually, information and data set are both symbolic and numeric but most of the well-known data analysis methods deal with only one kind of data. Even when fuzzy approaches are considered, which are not depended on the scales of variables, usually only numeric data is considered. The medical decision support methods usually are accessed in only one type of available data. Thus, sophisticated methods have been proposed such as integrated hybrid learning approaches to process symbolic and numeric data for the decision support tasks. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) is an efficient modelling method, which is based on human knowledge and experience and it can handle with uncertainty and it is constructed by extracted knowledge in the form of fuzzy rules. The FCM model can be enhanced if a fuzzy rule base (IF-THEN rules) is available. This rule base could be derived by a number of machine learning and knowledge extraction methods. Here it is introduced a hybrid attempt to handle situations with different types of available medical and /or clinical data and with difficulty to handle them for decision support tasks using soft computing techniques.

EEG signals from three participants were recorded while they performed four mental tasks designed to elicit hemispheric responses. Autoregressive (AR) models and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods were used to form feature vectors with which mental tasks can be discriminated. XCS achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 99.3% and a best average of 88.9%. The relative classification performance of XCS was then compared against four non-evolutionary classifier systems originating from different learning techniques. The experimental results will be used as part of our larger research effort investigating the feasibility of using EEG signals as an interface to allow paralysed persons to control a powered wheelchair or other devices.

We propose an intelligent monitoring system equipped with a camera network and an automatic elopement detection algorithm to reduce the risks of un-witnessed elopements from a dementia unit in order to avoid their potential catastrophic consequences. The camera network employs 23 cameras to record daffy activities in our test bed, which includes 15 residents, 4 registered and licensed practical nurses and a number of certified nursing assistants. An elopement detector is then built by using computer vision algorithms and a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect elopements and alert caregivers. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed system leverages the advantages of monitoring from multiple cameras and is able to detect elopements with almost 100% accuracy.

This research examines the feasibility of developing patient-specific alarm algorithms in real time at the bedside and evaluates the potential of these algorithms in helping improve patient monitoring. Modular components that facilitate real-time development of alarm algorithms were added to a system that simultaneously collects physiological data and clinical annotations at the bedside. At a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU), classification trees and neural networks for generating clinical alarms were trained for individual patients. These algorithms were evaluated immediately after training on subsequently collected data. The implemented system was capable of training and evaluating patient-specific algorithms in a consistent manner in real time at the bedside. The performance of patient-specific alarm algorithms improved as training data increased. Neural networks with eight hours of training data on average achieved a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.99, a positive predictive value of 0.79, and an accuracy of 0.99; these figures were 0.84, 0.98, 0.72, and 0.98 respectively for the classification trees. These results suggest that real-time development of patient-specific alarm algorithms is feasible using machine learning techniques. The patient-specific alarm algorithms developed in this study outperformed the bedside monitors from a decade ago and came close in performance to the new generation of monitors.

The missing element is a basic understanding of how to relate human functions (physiological, physical, and cognitive) to the design of intelligent devices and systems that aid and interact with people. Our stakeholder and clinician consultants identified a number of mobility barriers that have been intransigent to traditional approaches. The most important physical obstacles are stairs, steps, curbs, doorways (doors), rough/uneven surfaces, weather hazards (snow, ice), crowded/cluttered spaces, and confined spaces. Focus group participants suggested a number of ways to make interaction simpler, including natural language interfaces such as the ability to say "I want a drink'", a library of high level commands (open a door, park the wheelchair, ...), and a touchscreen interface with images so the user could point and use other gestures.

Stages obtained automatically can be used for retrospective population-level studies of lung cancer outcomes. While the system could in principle be applied to stage different cancer types, the paper focuses on staging lung cancer due to data availability. Experiments have quantified system performance on a corpus of reports from 710 lung cancer patients using four different SVM architectures for multi-class classification. Results show that a system based on standard binary SVM classifiers organised in a hierarchical architecture show the most promise with overall accuracy results of 0.64 and 0.82 across T and N stages, respectively.

We seek to evaluate the predictive power of individual spinal segment vector angles, towards the selection of the optimum angles for posture monitoring. A marker-based optoelectronic motion capture system was used to monitor seated posture for 9 healthy subjects during a range of motion flexion-extension exercise. Machine learning techniques were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the component vector angles recorded, and the range of motion for each vector angle was calculated for each subject. The overall flexion vector angle, which encompasses the entire spinal length between the C7 and L4 vertebrae, was determined to be the best predictor angle, due to its predictive accuracy and simplicity, and its relatively larger range of motion in all subjects.

The high-dimensionality-small-sample (HDSS) problem of cancer proteomic datasets still requires more sophisticated approaches to improve the classification accuracy. In this study we present a simple ensemble strategy based on measuring the generalizing capability of different subsets of training data and apply it in making final decision. Using a limited number of biomarkers along with 5 classification algorithms, the proposed method achieved a promising performance over a well-known prostate cancer mass spectroscopy dataset.

It is a real challenge to traditional segmentation algorithms. As a new kind of machine learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) has high generalization ability, especially for dataset with small number of samples in high dimensional space. SVM was originally developed for two-class classification. It is extended to solve multi-class classification problem. In this paper, 57 dimensional feature vectors for MRI image are selected as input for SVM. The segmentation of MRI image based on the Multi-Classification SVM (MCSVM) is investigated. As our experiment demonstrates, the boundaries of 7 kinds of encephalic tissues are extracted successfully, and it can reach satisfactory generalization accuracy. Thus, SVM exhibits its great potential in image segmentation.

Building a model from a single day or small number of days makes it prone to over-fitting or being unduly influenced by unusual events. With very long duration traces such as the multiple-year spanning Waikato datasets captured by the WAND Network Research Group it is possible to more accurately characterise behaviour and define appropriate boundaries for when traffic is similar enough and when it is different. We present here an approach to identifying and describing discrete "types" of days within these traces and what differences are important to distinguish between them. By applying machine learning techniques to the long duration traces it is possible to describe and simulate a generic day of a specific type without it being explicitly based on a particular day. The resulting parameters are used to configure a number of popular traffic generators which are then evaluated using the same criteria with which the model was built.

This paper describes our approach to building the hierarchical text classifier for the experimental CINDI Digital Library(1). The classification system constructed features a top-to-down, coarse-to-fine categorization procedure. We evaluate our system's performance by experiment on a self-generated corpus of the Computer Science papers archived in ACM DL.

In wireless MIMO communication systems which utilize antenna array at both transmit and receive sides, the redundancy of multipath signals can be exploited to extract more parameters such as angle-of-arrival, angle-of-departure and delay-of-arrival using advanced array signal processing techniques. In this paper, based on estimated multipath signal parameters in wireless MIMO communication systems, we propose a novel machine learning approach to determine the position of mobile targets using only one base station. This approach adopted the nearest neighbor regressor as the learning machine to estimation the highly nonlinear relationship between the multipath signal parameters and the position of mobile target. The simulation results have demonstrated the viability of the proposed methodology. This solution breaks the bottleneck of conventional mobile positioning systems which have to require multi-lateration of at least three base stations.

We propose a new ensemble learning method that employs a set of region based classifiers. Since the distribution of data can be different in different regions in the feature space, we split the data and generate classifiers based on each region and apply a weighted voting among the classifiers. We used I I data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to compare the performance of our new ensemble method with that of individual classifiers as well as other ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting. As a result, we found that our method improve performance, particularly when the base learner is Naive Bayes or SVM.									0	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-2983-7				2007							41	46				6	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BHB72	WOS:000252104400009

Fast and accurate techniques are imperative to achieve on-line transient stability assessment (TSA). This problem has been approached by various machine learning algorithms, however they find a class decision estimate rather than a probabilistic confidence of the class distribution. To counter the shortcoming of common machine learning methods, a novel machine learning technique, i.e. 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), for TSA is presented in this paper. RVM is based on a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, and as a feature it can yield a decision function that depends on only a very fewer number of so-called relevance vectors. The proposed method is tested on a practical power system, and compared with a state-of-the-art,support vector machine' (SVM) classifier. The classification performance is evaluated using false discriminate rate (FDR). It is demonstrated that the RVM classifier can yield a decision function that is much sparser than the SVM classifier while providing more higher classification accuracy. Consequently, the RVM classifier greatly reduces the computational complexity, making it more suitable for real-time implementation.

Automatic model generation for black box real-time systems	2007 DESIGN, AUTOMATION & TEST IN EUROPE CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION, VOLS 1-3	Design Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Expo		English	Proceedings Paper	Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE 07)	APR 16-20, 2007	Nice, FRANCE					Embedded systems are often assembled from black box components. System-level analyses, including verification and timing analysis, typically assume the system description, such as RTL or source code, as an input. There is therefore a need to automatically generate formal models of black box components to facilitate analysis. We propose a new method to generate models of real-time embedded systems based oil machine learning from execution traces, under a given hypothesis about the system's model of computation. Our technique is based on a novel formulation of the model generation problem as learning a dependency graph that indicates partial ordering between tasks. Tests based on all industry case study demonstrate that the learning algorithm can scale lip and that the deduced system model accurately reflects dependencies between tasks in the original design. These dependencies help its formally prove properties of the system and also extract data dependencies that are not explicitly stated in the specifications of black box components.

While there is a large body of research that explores biometrics as a means of verifying identity, there has been very little work done to determine if biometric measures can be used to determine specific human attributes. If it is possible to discover such attributes, they would be useful in situations where a biometric system fails to identify an individual that has not been enrolled, yet still needs to be identified. The iris was selected as the biometric to analyze for two major reasons: (1) quality methods have already been developed to segment and encode an iris image, (2) current iris encoding methods are conducive to selecting and extracting attributes from an iris texture and creating a meaningful feature vector.

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14], but the wireless network is still vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks, we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features. monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our Wireless Self Protection System (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.

We use patch-based feature vectors common in object recognition work as a basis for our image-to-image distance functions. Our large-margin formulation for learning the distance functions is similar to formulations used in the machine learning literature on distance metric learning, however we differ in that we learn local distance functions a different parameterized function for every image of our training set-whereas typically a single global distance function is learned. This was a novel approach first introduced in Frome, Singer, & Malik, NIPS 2006. In that work we learned the local distance functions independently, and the outputs of these functions could not be compared at test time without the use of additional heuristics or training. Here we introduce a different approach that has the advantage that it learns distance functions that are globally consistent in that they can be directly compared for purposes of retrieval and classification. The output of the learning algorithm are weights assigned to the image features, which is intuitively appealing in the computer vision setting: some features are more salient than others, and which are more salient depends on the category, or image, being considered We train and test using the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark. Using fifteen training images per category, we achieved a mean recognition rate of 63.2% and using twenty images per category, a rate of 66.6%.

Most existing techniques use the Mahalanobis metric without incorporating the geometry of positive matrices and experience difficulties in the optimization procedure. In this paper we introduce the use of Iwasawa decomposition, a unique and effective parametrization of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, for performing metric learning tasks. Unlike other previously employed factorizations, the use of the Iwasawa decomposition is able to reformulate the semidefinite programming (SDP) problems as smooth convex nonlinear programming (NLP) problems with much simpler constraints. We also introduce a modified Iwasawa coordinates for rank-deficient positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices which enables the unifying of the metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction. We show that the Iwasawa decomposition can be easily used in most recent proposed metric learning algorithms and have applied it to the Neighbourhood Components Analysis (NCA). The experimental results on several public domain datasets are also presented.

The usual approach for automatically determining correspondences begins by comparing small neighborhoods of high saliency in both images. Since speed is of the essence, most current approaches for local region matching involve the computation of a feature vector that is invariant to various geometric and photometric transformations, followed by fast distance computations using standard vector norms. These algorithms include many parameters, and choosing an algorithm and setting its parameters for a given problem is more an art than a science. Furthermore, although invariance of the resulting feature space is in general desirable, there is necessarily a tradeoff between invariance and descriptiveness for any given task. In this paper we pose local region matching as a classification problem, and use powerful machine learning techniques to train a classifier that selects features from a much larger pool. Our algorithm can be trained on specific domains or tasks, and performs better than the state of the art in such cases.

In this paper, we develop a new structural perception of data based on local contexts. We first identify the contextual set of a point by finding its nearest neighbors. Then the contextual distance between the point and one of its neighbors is defined by the difference between their contribution to the integrity of the geometric structure of the contextual set, which is depicted by a structural descriptor The centroid and the coding length are introduced as the examples of descriptors of the contextual set. Furthermore, a directed graph (digraph) is built to model the asymmetry of perception. The edges of the digraph are weighted based on the contextual distances. Thus direction is brought to the undirected data. And the structural perception of data can be performed by mining the properties of the digraph. We also present the method for deriving the global digraph Laplacian from the alignment of the local digraph Laplacians. Experimental results on clustering and ranking of toy problems and real data show the superiority of asymmetric perception.

Given an echo study video sequence, the system outputs a view label among the pre-defined standard views. The system is built based on a machine learning approach that extracts knowledge from an annotated database. It characterizes three features: 1) integrating local and global evidence, 2) utilizing view specific knowledge, and 3) employing a multi-class Logit-boost algorithm. In our prototype system, we classify four standard cardiac views: apical four chamber and apical two chamber parasternal long axis and parasternal short axis (at mid cavity). We achieve a classification accuracy over 96% both of training and test data sets and the system runs in a second in the environment of Pentium 4 PC with 3.4GHz CPU and 1.5G RAM.	[Park, J.

High-level knowledge about user preferences in multimodal interaction is inferred, using data mining techniques based on context parameters of the environment. The current approach facilitates automatic selection of multimodality capable interaction devices and their according rendering facilities for media output streams. An overview of the learning subsystem being part of the Distributed Communication Sphere (DCS) management architecture, proposed within the EU IST-027617 project SPICE, will be introduced. Further the design of the learning approach will be discussed, including the definition and adaptation of snapshot data based on environment parameters. Frequent snapshots form the basis for learning, and therefore for the described association rule mining algorithm. Theoretical simulation results are presented and an outlook towards next research steps is given.

We have constructed a reinforcement learning system for our humanoid robot Nico, which uses prosodic feedback to refine the parameters of a social waving behavior. We define a waving behavior to be an oscillation of Nico's elbow joint, parameterized by amplitude and frequency. Our system explores a space of amplitude and frequency values, using q-learning to learn the wave which optimally satisfies a human tutor. To estimate tutor feedback in real-time, we first segment speech from ambient noise using a maximum-likelihood voice-activation detector. We then use a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier, with k=3, over 15 prosodic features, to estimate a binary approval/disapproval feedback signal from segmented utterances. Both our voice-activation detector and prosody classifier are trained on the speech of the individual tutor. We show that our system learns the tutor's desired wave, over the course of a sequence of trial-feedback cycles. We demonstrate our learning results for a single speaker on a space of nine distinct waving behaviors.

GPC provides not only accurate decisions as other nonlinear machine learning tools do, i.e. support vector machines or neural networks, but it also assigns posterior probabilities to each one of its output. This is a significant advantage of GPC with respect to other machine learning tools for channel equalization, because the channel decoder benefits from its soft outputs to provide significantly better error correcting capabilities for the entire communication system. As, for previous schemes, the channel decoder had to rely on the hard decisions given by the equalizer, because the output of these methods cannot be transformed into posterior probabilities. We show that the GCP equalizer is able to estimate posterior probabilities accurately in a variety of real digital communications channel.

Strategic Management, an emerging discipline of management sciences, focuses on setting mission, vision, goals and objectives, analyzing internal and external organizational environments, making strategic decisions and taking actions to implement the designed strategy. In this paper, we have revealed that the whole data mining process forms a part of strategic analysis phase of strategic management. We have mapped the data mining activities to the strategic analysis phase from both the conceptual as well as the practical perspectives. We have found that if data mining is used for conducting environmental analysis, much better results could be yielded by helping the managers to formulate target-oriented strategies more efficiently and effectively. Thus, the boundaries of this emerging field - Data Mining - have been redefined using the essence and the key attributes of strategic management.

A multi-scale Tikhonov regularization scheme for implicit surface modelling	2007 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 17-22, 2007	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE, hp invent, INI-GraphicsNet, VIOSO			SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Kernel machines have recently been considered as a promising solution for implicit surface modelling. A key challenge of machine learning solutions is how to fit implicit shape models from large-scale sets of point cloud samples efficiently. In this paper, we propose a fast solution for approximating implicit surfaces based on a multi-scale Tikhonov regularization scheme. The optimization of our scheme is formulated into a sparse linear equation system, which can be efficiently solved by factorization methods. Different from traditional approaches, our scheme does not employ auxiliary off-surface points, which not only saves the computational cost but also avoids the problem of injected noise. To further speedup our solution, we present a multi-scale surface fitting algorithm of coarse to fine modelling. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our solution on a number of datasets of different scales. The promising results show that our suggested scheme is considerably more efficient than the state-of-the-art approach.

Currently the use of generative models is limited due to the difficulty in effectively learning them. Anew learning framework is proposed in this paper which progressively learns a target generative distribution through discriminative approaches. This framework provides many interesting aspects to the literature. From the generative model side: (1) A reference distribution is used to assist the learning process, which removes the need for a sampling processes in the early stages. (2) The classification power of discriminative approaches, e.g. boosting, is directly utilized. (3) The ability to select/explore features from a large candidate pool allows us to make nearly no assumptions about the training data. From the discriminative model side: (1) This framework improves the modeling capability of discriminative models. (2) It can start with source training data only and gradually "invent" negative samples. (3) We show how sampling schemes can be introduced to discriminative models. (4) The learning procedure helps to tighten the decision boundaries for classification, and therefore, improves robustness. In this paper, we show a variety of applications including texture modeling and classification, non-photo-realistic rendering, learning image statistics/denoising, and face modeling. The framework handles both homogeneous patterns, e.g. textures, and inhomogeneous patterns, e.g. faces, with nearly an identical parameter setting for all the tasks in the learning stage.

In data mining, one typically works with immense volumes of raw data, which demands effective algorithms to explore the data space. In analogy to data mining, the space of meaningful features for image analysis is also quite vast. Recently, the challenges associated with these problem areas have become more tractable through progress made in machine learning and concerted research effort in manual feature design by domain experts. In this paper, we propose a feature mining paradigm for image classification and examine several feature mining strategies. We also derive a principled approach for dealing with features with varying computational demands. Our goal is to alleviate the burden of manual feature design, which is a key problem in computer vision and machine learning. We include an in-depth empirical study on three typical data sets and offer theoretical explanations for the performance of various feature mining strategies. As a final confirmation of our ideas, we show results of a system, that utilizing feature mining strategies matches or outperforms the best reported results on pedestrian classification (where considerable effort has been devoted to expert feature design).

What makes a good model of natural images?	2007 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-8	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 17-22, 2007	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE, hp invent, INI-GraphicsNet, VIOSO			COMPONENT ANALYSIS; STATISTICS; GAUSSIANS	Many low-level vision algorithms assume a prior probability over images, and there has been great interest in trying to learn this prior from examples. Since images are very non Gaussian, high dimensional, continuous signals, learning their distribution presents a tremendous computational challenge. Perhaps the most successful recent algorithm is the Fields of Experts (FOE) (201 model which has shown impressive performance by modeling image statistics with a product of potentials defined on filter outputs. However, as in previous models of images based on filter outputs [30], calculating the probability of an image given the model requires evaluating an intractable partition function. This makes learning very slow (requires Monte-Carlo sampling at every step) and makes it virtually impossible to compare the likelihood of two different models. Given this computational difficulty, it is hard to say whether nonintuitive-features learned by such models represent a true property of natural images or an artifact of the approximations used during learning. In this paper we present (1) tractable lower and upper bounds on the partition function of models based on filter outputs and (2) efficient learning algorithms that do not require any sampling. Our results are based on recent results in machine learning that deal with Gaussian potentials. We extend these results to non-Gaussian potentials and derive a novel, basis rotation algorithm for approximating the maximum likelihood filters. Our results allow us to (1) rigorously compare the likelihood of different models and (2) calculate high likelihood models of natural image statistics in a matter of minutes. Applying our results to previous models shows that the nonintuitive features are not an artifact of the learning process but rather are capturing robust properties of natural images.

Since these descriptors do not lie on a vector space, well known machine learning techniques are not adequate to learn the classifiers. The space of d-dimensional nonsingular covariance matrices can be represented as a connected Riemannian manifold. We present a novel approach for classifying points lying on a Riemannian manifold by incorporating the a priori information about the geometry of the space. The algorithm is tested on INRIA human database where superior detection rates are observed over the previous approaches.

One-class machine learning for brain activation detection	2007 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-8	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 17-22, 2007	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE, hp invent, INI-GraphicsNet, VIOSO			FMRI DATA; CLASSIFICATION; COMPONENTS; SUPPORT	Machine learning methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), have been applied to fMRI data analysis, where most studies focus on supervised detection and classification of cognitive states. In this work, we study the general fMRI activation detection using SVM in an unsupervised way instead of the classification of cognitive states. Specifically, activation detection is formulated as an outlier (activated voxels) detection problem of the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). An OCSVM implementation, v-SVM, is used where parameter v controls the outlier ratio, and is usually unknown. We propose a detection method that is not sensitive to v randomly set within a range known a priori. In cases that this range is also unknown, we consider v estimation using geometry and texture features. Results from both synthetic and experimental data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

By emphasizing locality and interactivity, our solution is faithful to how the registration results are used in practice. Given a user-specified point, the click-point linking provides a single point-wise correspondence between a data pair In order to link visually dissimilar local regions, a correspondence is sought by using only geometrical context without comparing the local appearances. Our solution is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) without estimating a domain transformation explicitly. A spatial likelihood of Gaussian mixture form is designed to capture geometrical configurations between the point-of-interest and a hierarchy of global-to-local 3D landmarks that are detected using machine learning and entropy based feature detectors. A closed-form-formula is derived to specify each Gaussian component by exploiting geometric invariances under specific group of domain transformation via RANSAC-like random sampling. A mean shift algorithm is applied to robustly and efficiently solve the local MLE problem, replacing the standard consensus step of the RANSAC Two transformation groups of pure translation and scaling/translation are considered in this paper We test feasibility of the proposed approach with 16 pairs of whole-body CT data, demonstrating the effectiveness.

To bridge the semantic gap between the low-level features and the high-level video concepts, a mid-level understanding of the video contents, i.e., salient object is detected based on the techniques of image segmentation and machine learning. Specifically, 21 salient object detectors are developed and tested on TRECVID 2005 development video corpus. In addition, a boosting method is proposed to select the most representative features to achieve a higher performance than only using single modality, and lower complexity than taking all features into account.

The model fitting task in this class of algorithms has largely been carried out to date based on maximum likelihood. An alternative approach that is prevalent in statistics and machine learning is to use Bayesian inference. In this paper, we provide a framework for the application of Bayesian inference techniques in probabilistic model-based optimization. Based on this framework, a simple continuous Bayesian Estimation of Distribution Algorithm is described. We evaluate and compare this algorithm experimentally with its maximum likelihood equivalent, UMDA(c)(G).

A highly accurate prediction is essential to ensure the quality of these decisions. Time series forecasting is based on historical data and the predictions are usually made using statistical methods. These characteristics make the forecasting problem an interesting application of Machine learning techniques, especially for Boosting techniques and Genetic programming. Boosting techniques currently receive a lot of attention; they combine predictions from different forecasting methods as a procedure to improve the accuracy. This paper explores Genetic Programming (GP) and Boosting technique to obtain an ensemble of regressors and proposes a new formula for the updating of the weights and for the final hypothesis. This new formula is based on the correlation coefficient instead of the loss function used by traditional boosting algorithms, this new algorithm is called Boosting using Correlation Coefficient (BCC). To validate this method, experiments were accomplished using real, financial and artificial series generated by Monte Carlo Simulation. The results obtained by using this new methodology were compared with the results obtained from GP, GPBoost and the traditional statistical methodology (ARMA).

Currently a number of localization machine learning algorithms have been employed on this problem, including SVM and K-NN. However, in terms of performance there is little success. in this paper, we apply a Genetic Algorithm to optimize a kernel component analysis solution, an algorithm that we believe will have better performance titan standalone Kernel PCA. We will experiment using the protein location data from the Horton and Nakai Yeast and E.Coli databases.. We will then compare the performance of our optimized system with previous methods. Results show that GA enhanced Kernel Component Analysis can improve classification.

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms(EDAs) focus on where the promising region is, however have less consideration about behavior of each individual in solution search algorithms. Since the basic ideas of EP and EDAs are quite different, it is possible to make them reinforce each other. In this paper, we present a hybrid evolutionary framework to make use of both the ideas of EP and EDAs through introducing a mini estimation operator into EP's search cycle. Unlike previous EDAs that use probability density function(PDF), the estimation mechanism used in the proposed framework is the k-nearest neighbor estimation which can perform better with relative small amount of training samples. Our experimental results have shown that the incorporation of machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbor estimation, can improve the performance of evolutionary optimisation algorithms for a large number of benchmark functions.

Evolutionary algorithms have been used as a method for evolving hypernetworks. The order of a hyperedge is defined as the number of feature variables in the hyperedge and it is an important parameter of the hypernetwork model. Previous studies used fixed-order hyperedges which limit model spaces and, thus, the best performance achievable by hypernetworks. Here, we present a method for evolving variable-order hypernetwork models. To find the proper orders automatically, the fitness values are calculated for each hyperedge and the hyperedges with low fitness values are substituted by new hyperedges. The method was tested on three data sets from UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the evolutionary hypernetworks show classification accuracies comparable to those of other conventional algorithms, find appropriate orders of hyperedges automatically, and extract important rules in the hyperedges for the given pattern classification problems.

Migrations occur between distributed XCS classifier sub-populations using classifiers ranked according to numerosity, fitness or randomly selected. The influence of the degree-of-connectivity introduced by Fully-Connected, Bi-directional Ring and Uni-directional Ring, topologies is examined. Results indicate that classifier migration is an effective method for improving classification accuracy, improving learning speed and reducing final classifier population size, in the single-step classification of noisy, artefact-inclusive human electroencephalographic signals. The experimental results will be used as part of our larger research effort investigating the feasibility of using EEG signals as an interface to allow paralysed persons to control a powered wheelchair or other devices.
