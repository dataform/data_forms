J	Hershberger, DE; Kargupta, H				Hershberger, DE; Kargupta, H			Distributed multivariate regression using wavelet-based collective data mining	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						data mining; distributed data mining; collective data mining; knowledge discovery; wavelets; regression		This paper presents a method for distributed multivariate regression using wavelet-based collective data mining (CDM). The method seamlessly blends machine learning and the theory of communication with the statistical methods employed in parametric multivariate regression to provide an effective data mining technique for use in a distributed data and computation environment. The technique is applied to two benchmark data sets, producing results that are consistent with those obtained by applying standard parametric regression techniques to centralized data sets. Evaluation of the method in terms of mode accuracy as a function of appropriateness of the selected wavelet function, relative number of nonlinear cross-terms. and sample size demonstrates that accurate parametric multivariate regression models call be generated from distributed, heterogeneous, data sets with minimal data communication overhead compared to that required to aggregate a distributed data set. Application of this method to linear discriminant analysis, which is related Co parametric multivariate regression, produced classification results on the Iris data set that are comparable to those obtained with centralized data analysis.

This article focuses on one general approach to such decision making: predict the consequences of possible system actions on the basis of prior empirical learning, and evaluate the possible actions, taking into account situation-dependent priorities and the tradeoffs between the consequences. This decision-theoretic approach is illustrated in detail with reference to an example decision problem, for which models for decision making were learned from experimental data. It is shown how influence diagrams and methods of decision-theoretic planning can be applied to arrive at empirically well-founded decisions. This paradigm is then compared with two other paradigms that are often employed in intelligent user interfaces. Finally, various possible ways of learning (or otherwise deriving) suitable decision-theoretic models are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Whigham, PA; Crapper, PF				Whigham, PA; Crapper, PF			Modelling rainfall-runoff using genetic programming	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation	DEC, 1998	HOBART, AUSTRALIA			rainfall runoff; genetic programming		Genetic programming is an inductive form of machine learning that evolves a computer program to perform a task defined by a set of presented (training) examples and has been successfully applied to problems that are complex, nonlinear and where the size, shape, and overall form of the solution are not explicitly known in advance. This paper describes the application of a grammatically-based genetic programming system to discover rainfall-runoff relationships for two vastly different catchments. A context-free grammar is used to define the search space for the mathematical language used to express the evolving programs. A daily time series of rainfall-runoff is used to train the evolving population. A deterministic lumped parameter model, based on the unit hydrograph, is compared with the results of the evolved models on an independent data set. The favourable results of the genetic programming approach show that machine learning techniques are potentially a useful tool for developing hydrological models, especially when surface water movement and water losses are poorly understood.

J	Anand, SS; Hamilton, PW; Hughes, JG; Bell, DA				Anand, SS; Hamilton, PW; Hughes, JG; Bell, DA			On prognostic models, artificial intelligence and censored observations	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						colorectal cancer; survival analysis; nearest neighbour; censored observations	REGRESSION	The development of prognostic models for assisting medical practitioners with decision making is not a trivial task. Models need to possess a number of desirable characteristics and few, if any, current modelling approaches based on statistical or artificial intelligence can produce models that display all these characteristics. The inability of modelling techniques to provide truly useful models has led to interest in these models being purely academic in nature. This in turn has resulted in only a very small percentage of models that have been developed being deployed in practice. On the other hand, new modelling paradigms are being proposed continuously within the machine learning and statistical community and claims, often based on inadequate evaluation, being made on their superiority over traditional modelling methods. We believe that for new modelling approaches to deliver true net benefits over traditional techniques, an evaluation centric approach to their development is essential. in this paper we present such an evaluation centric approach to developing extensions to the basic k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) paradigm. We use standard statistical techniques to enhance the distance metric used and a framework based on evidence theory to obtain a prediction for the target example from the outcome of the retrieved exemplars. We refer to this new k-NN algorithm as Censored k-NN (Ck-NN). This reflects the enhancements made to k-NN that are aimed at providing a means for handling censored observations within k-NN.

The use of these tools is illustrated through the construction of two video browsers, which allow a user to fast forward (or rewind) to Frames, shots, or scenes containing a particular character, characters, or other labeled content. The two browsers developed in this work are: (1) a basic video browser, which exploits relations between high-level scripting information and closed captions, and (2) an advanced video browser, which augments the basic browser with annotations gained from applying machine learning. The learner helps the system adapt to different peoples' labelings by accepting positive and negative examples of labeled content from a user, and relating these to low-level color and texture features extracted from the digitized video. This learning happens interactively, and is used to infer labels on data the user has not yet seen. The labeled data may then be browsed or retrieved from the database in real time. An evaluation of the learning performance shows that a combination of low-level color signal features outperforms several other combinations of signal features in learning character labels in an episode of the TV situation comedy. Seinfeld. We discuss several issues that arise in the combination of low-level and high-level information. and illustrate solutions to these issues within the context of browsing television sitcoms.

Advances in technology based on emerging work in decision theory, information science, and cognitive science will allow for use of these computational models in more expansive "advisory" roles to decision makers of all types. To what degree can public sector decision makers use computational models to support or advise decision making? As these new technologies become a routine part of the policy process, will a belief in computer omnipotence tempt public sector decision makers to abdicate personal responsibility for poor choices? The authors explore the choice-related implications associated with the increased use of computer-based models, define possible computer-based decision support models (CBDSMs), and present a typology of credible uses of CBDSMs.	Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA	Saunders-Newton, D (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Sch Policy Planning & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.

J	Turcotte, M; Muggleton, SH; Sternberg, MJE				Turcotte, M; Muggleton, SH; Sternberg, MJE			Automated discovery of structural signatures of protein fold and function	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						protein structure; protein function; knowledge discovery; folding	DIHYDROFOLATE-REDUCTASE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; DNA RECOGNITION; PATTERNS; BINDING; CLASSIFICATION; MOTIFS; RESOLUTION; SEQUENCES; DATABASE	There are constraints on a protein sequence/structure for it to adopt a particular fold. These constraints could be either a local signature involving particular sequences or arrangements of secondary structure or a global signature involving features along the entire chain. To search systematically for protein fold signatures, we have explored the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). ILP is a machine learning technique which derives rules from observation and encoded principles. The derived rules are readily interpreted in terms of concepts used by experts. For 20 populated folds in SCOP, 59 rules were found automatically. The accuracy of these rules, which is defined as the number of true positive plus true negative over the total number of examples, is 74% (cross-validated value). Further analysis was carried out for 23 signatures covering 30 % or more positive examples of a particular fold. The work showed that signatures of protein folds exist, about half of rules discovered automatically coincide with the level of fold in the SCOP classification. Other signatures correspond to homologous family and may be the consequence of a functional requirement. Examination of the rules shows that many correspond to established principles published in specific literature. However, in general, the list of signatures is not part of standard biological databases of protein patterns. We find that the length of the loops makes an important contribution to the signatures, suggesting that this is an important determinant of the identity of protein folds. With the expansion in the number of determined protein structures, stimulated by structural genomics initiatives, there will be an increased need for automated methods to extract principles of protein folding from coordinates.

TD learning is used to adjust the weights for evaluation features over the course of a series of games, starting from arbitrary initial values. For some games, to obtain weights accurate enough for high-performance play will require the TD learning phase to make use of minimax searches. A theoretical description of TD applied to minimax search is given, and we discuss how the theoretical characteristics of the method interact with practical considerations. These include the depth of search appropriate for successful learning and the use of self-play to enable the algorithm to be independent of human knowledge. We then report on experiments that obtained values for use in shogi-playing programs. Unlike chess, shogi has no generally agreed standardized set of values for pieces, so there is more need for machine learning. We compare our machine-learnt values, obtained without any human knowledge input, with hand-crafted values. TD learning was successful in obtaining values that performed well in matches against hand-crafted values. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The basic idea Is to first map the input space into a feature space via a nonlinear map and then compute the principal components in that feature space. This letter illustrates the potential of kernel PCA for texture classification. Accordingly, supervised texture classification mas performed using kernel PCA for texture feature extraction. By adopting a polynomial kernel, the principal components were computed within the product space of the input pixels making up the texture patterns, thereby producing a good performance.

J	Talavera, L; Bejar, J				Talavera, L; Bejar, J			Generality-based conceptual clustering with probabilistic concepts	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						conceptual clustering; hierarchical clustering; probabilistic concepts; user interaction		Statistical research in clustering has almost universally focused on data sets described by continuous features and its methods are difficult to apply to tasks involving symbolic features. In addition, these methods are seldom concerned with helping the user in interpreting the results obtained. Machine learning researchers have developed conceptual clustering methods aimed at solving these problems. Following a long term tradition in Al, early conceptual clustering implementations employed logic as the mechanism of concept representation. However, logical representations have been criticized for constraining the resulting cluster structures to be described by necessary and sufficient conditions. An alternative are probabilistic concepts which associate a probability or weight with each property of the concept definition. In this paper, we propose a symbolic hierarchical clustering model that makes use of probabilistic representations and extends the traditional ideas of specificity-generality typically found in machine learning. We propose a parameterized measure that allows users to specify both the number of levels and the degree of generality of each level. By providing some feedback to the user about the balance of the generality of the concepts created at each level and given the intuitive behavior of the user parameter, the system improves user interaction in the clustering process.

However, this is not the general case. In other domains, using decision trees for imputing missing attribute values does not outperform other methods. Trying to identify the reasons behind the success or failure of the various methods for filling missing values on different domains can be useful for deciding the technique to be used when learning concepts from a new domain with missing values. This paper presents a technique by which to approach to previous goal and presents the results of applying the technique on predicting the success or failure of a method that uses decision trees to fill the missing values in an ordered manner. Results are encouraging because the obtained decision tree is simple and it can even provide hints for further improvement on the use of decision trees to impute missing attribute values.

In this paper we present Warmr, the first ILP data mining algorithm to be applied to chemoinformatic data. We illustrate the value of Warmr by applying it to a well studied database of chemical compounds tested for carcinogenicity in rodents. Data mining was used to find all frequent substructures in the database, and knowledge of these frequent substructures is shown to add value to the database. One use of the frequent substructures was to convert them into probabilistic prediction rules relating compound description to carcinogenesis. These rules were found to be accurate on test data, and to give some insight into the relationship between structure and activity in carcinogenesis. The substructures were also used to prove that there existed no accurate rule, based purely on atom-bond substructure with less than seven conditions, that could predict carcinogenicity. This results put a lower bound on the complexity of the relationship between chemical structure and carcinogenicity. Only by using a data mining algorithm, and by doing a complete search, is it possible to prove such a result. Finally the frequent substructures were shown to add value by increasing the accuracy of statistical and machine learning programs that were trained to predict chemical carcinogenicity. We conclude that Warmr, and ILP data mining methods generally, are an important new tool for analysing chemical databases.

It has important applications in many fields of modern digital system engineering, such as combinational and sequential logic synthesis for VLSI systems, pattern analysis, knowledge discovery, machine learning, decision systems, data bases, data mining etc. However, its practical usefulness for very complex systems has been limited by the lack of an effective and efficient method for selecting the appropriate input supports for sub-systems. In this paper, a new effective and efficient functional decomposition method is proposed and discussed. This method is based on applying information relationship measures to input support selection. Using information relationship measures allows us to reduce the search space to a manageable size while retaining high-quality solutions in the reduced space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to construct optimal or near-optimal supports very efficiently, even for large systems. It is many times faster than the systematic support selection method, but delivers results of comparable quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This implies that interaction is usually tedious, while interrupting the user is not really desired in ubiquitous computing. We propose adding an array of hardware sensors to the system that, together with machine learning techniques, make the device aware of its context while it is being used. The goal is to make it learn the context-descriptions from its user on the spot, while minimising user-interaction and maximising reliability.

To alleviate the problem of obtaining enough training data, simulated training data were generated from single-date images. A one-pass classification with four machine learning algorithms, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Decision Tree Classifiers (DTC), and the Maximum-Likelihood Classifier (MLC), were tested. Recognition rates, ease of use, and degree of automation of the four algorithms were assessed. The results showed that the incorporation of cross-combined simulated training data enhanced the detection of nature of change. Compared to conventional post-classification comparison methods, LVQ and ore did better in terms of overall accuracy In terms of average accuracy of the change classes, LVQ was the best performer. DTC was the easiest to use and the most robust in training. MLP procedures were the most difficult to replicate.

IDS's have been developed for privileged UNIX programs like sendmail, lpr, and login. The IDS that we have built is for applets. It serves as a protection against malicious applets and warns the user when such applets are downloaded. Our system monitors applets using system call traces from the Java runtime environment. Feature vectors created from the system call traces are used to train a machine learning algorithm. The rule-set produced by the algorithm can then be used to distinguish hostile applets from good applets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Neural networks seem to be promising for the computer-aided classification of otoneurological patients provided that the number of patients used is sufficiently large.

J	Kwee, I; Schmidhuber, J				Kwee, I; Schmidhuber, J			Optimal control using the transport equation: The Liouville machine	ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR			English	Article						machine learning; shortest path; optimal control; transport theory		Transport theory describes the scattering behavior of physical particles such as photons. Here we show how to connect this theory to optimal control theory and to adaptive behavior of agents embedded in an environment. Environments and tasks are defined by physical boundary conditions. Given some task, we compute a set of probability densities on continuous state and action and time. From these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state. Liouville's conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t, state s, and action a must equal the density at t + dt, s + ds, a + da. Discretization yields a linear system that can be solved directly and whose solution corresponds to an optimal policy. Discounted reward schemes are incorporated naturally by taking the Laplace transform of the equations. The Liouville machine quickly solves rather complex maze problems.

The methodology is mainly based on the idea that a large case library can be transformed to a small case library together with a group of adaptation rules, which are generated by fuzzy decision trees. Firstly, an approach to learning feature weights automatically is used to evaluate the importance of different features in a given case-base. Secondly, clustering of cases will be carried out to identify different concepts in the case-base using the acquired feature knowledge. Thirdly, adaptation rules will be mined for each concept using fuzzy decision trees. Finally, a selection strategy based on the concepts of epsilon-coverage and epsilon-reachability is used to select representative cases. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated experimentally using two sets of testing data.

They cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions or to new objects. The application of machine learning to image interpretation is the next logical step. Our proposed approach aims at the development of dedicated machine learning techniques at all levels of image interpretation in a systematic fashion. In this paper we propose a system which uses Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to optimize image segmentation at the low level according to changing image acquisition conditions and image quality. The intermediate-level unit extracts the case representation used by the high-level unit for further processing. At the high level, CBR is employed to dynamically adapt image interpretation.

Amer Soc Informat Sci, Special Interest Grp/Classificat Res				This paper presents a method that exploits the hierarchical structure of an indexing vocabulary to guide the development and training of machine learning methods for automatic text categorization. We present the design of a hierarchical classifier based on the divide-and-conquer principle. The method is evaluated using backpropagation neural networks, such as the machine learning algorithm, that learn to assign MeSH categories to a subset of MEDLINE records. Comparisons with traditional Rocchio's algorithm adapted for text categorization, as well as flat neural network classifiers, are provided. The results indicate that the use of hierarchical structures improves performance significantly.

Adiabatic increments retain the Kuhn-Tucker conditions on all previously seen training data, in a number of steps each computed analytically. The incremental procedure is reversible, and decremental "unlearning" offers an efficient method to exactly evaluate leave-one-out generalization performance. Interpretation of decremental unlearning in feature space sheds light on the relationship between generalization and geometry of the data.

This work extends the new paradigm for computer animation, video textures, which uses recorded video to generate novel animations by replaying the video samples in a new order. Here we concentrate on video sprites, which are a special type of video texture. In video sprites, instead of storing whole images, the object of interest is separated from the background and the video samples are stored as a sequence of alpha-matted sprites with associated velocity information. They can be rendered anywhere on the screen to create a novel animation of the object. We present methods to create such animations by finding a sequence of sprite samples that is both visually smooth and follows a desired path. To estimate visual smoothness, we train a linear classifier to estimate visual similarity between video samples. If the motion path is known in advance, we use beam search to find a good sample sequence. We can specify the motion interactively by precomputing the sequence cost function using Q-learning.

Wastewater treatment plants are complex environmental processes that are difficult to manage and control. This paper discusses the qualitative and quantitative performance of several machine learning and statistical methods to discover knowledge patterns in data. The methods are tested and compared on a wastewater treatment data set. The methods used are: induction of decision trees, two different techniques of rule induction and two memory-based learning methods: instance-based learning and case-based learning. All the knowledge patterns discovered by the different methods are compared in terms of predictive accuracy, the number of attributes and examples used, and the meaningful-ness to domain experts.

The goal is to develop AI, and in particular machine learning and data mining, methods to study the complex phenomenon of expressive music performance. Formulating formal, quantitative models of expressive performance is one of the big open research problems in contemporary (empirical and cognitive) musicology. Our project develops a new direction in this field: we use inductive learning techniques to discover general and valid expression principles from (large amounts of) real performance data. The project is currently starting its third year and is planned to continue for at least four more years. In the following, we explain the basic notions of expressive music performance, and why this is such a central phenomenon in music. We present the general research framework of the project, and discuss the various challenges and research opportunities that emerge in this framework. We then briefly describe the current state of the project and list the main achievements made so far. In the rest of the paper, we discuss in more detail one particular data training approach (including a new algorithm for learning characterisation rules) that we have developed recently. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm can discover very general and robust expression principles, some of which actually constitute novel discoveries from a musicological viewpoint.

Initial estimates of forest damage included 17,000 acres (6,900 ha) of 70-100% tree mortality. Restoration efforts following the fire were complicated by the large scale of the fire, and by the presence of extensive natural and man-made hazards. These conditions forced a reliance on remote sensing techniques for mapping and classifying the burn region. During and after the fire, remote-sensing data was acquired from a variety of aircraft-based and satellite-based sensors, including Landsat 7. We now report on the application of a machine learning technique, implemented in a software package called GENIE, to the classification of forest fire burn severity using Landsat 7 ETM+ multispectral imagery. The details of this automatic classification are compared to the manually produced burn classification, which was derived from field observations and manual interpretation of high-resolution aerial color/infrared photography.

It is often difficult and time-consuming to develop classifiers by hand, so many researchers have turned to techniques from the fields of statistics and machine learning to automatically generate classifiers. Common techniques include maximum likelihood classifiers, neural networks and genetic algorithms. We present a new system called AFREET, which uses a recently developed machine learning paradigm called Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In contrast to other techniques, SVMs offer a solid mathematical foundation that provides a probabilistic guarantee on how well the classifier will generalize to un een data. In addition the SVM training algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal SVM classifier, can learn highly non-linear discrimination functions, copes extremely well with high-dimensional feature spaces (such as hyperspectral data), and scales well to large problem sizes. AFREET combines an SVM with a sophisticated spatio-spectral feature construction mechanism that allows it to classify spectrally ambiguous pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system by applying AFREET to several broad area classification problems in remote sensing, and provide a comparison with conventional maximun likelihood classification.

However, no individual technique is suitable for detection of any disease pattern in any image. This paper aims to develop a fusion approach to combine multiple techniques to help the physician obtain an accurate diagnosis. Multisensor data fusion technique based on Bayesian Inference is applied in the proposed approach. The combination is based on probability theory and employed nonlinear combination. Before the fusion process, a knowledge-based technique is used for the evaluation of sub-decisions. Similar processed endoscopic case done previously is automatically selected from a case repository and expert physician experience is sought for the supervised evaluation. Meantime, a machine-learning technique is incorporated in the fusion process to increase the accuracy of the decision-making. The new case obtained after the evaluation is fed back as learning data to the fusion process. The proposed decision support approach has been developed. The preliminary results are encouraging and lead support to the feasibility of the method.

Here, to avoid this, we apply a novel methodology centred on reinforcement learning (RL) whereby, unlike most forms of machine learning, an autonomous agent is not instructed on how to act by example but instead learns directly by trying control actions and seeking for those giving maximum reward. A central notion is the performance or value function that, in a given current state, signifies the contribution a specific action will make towards maximising the final performance or reward over an entire batch. For batch-to-batch, incremental learning and control, the initially unknown value function is here represented using wire fitting and a neural network. This is a simple yet powerful means of simultaneously learning and fitting the value function. The performance achieved in each completed batch can be propagated from the end point back through the intermediate states. With echoes of dynamic programming, this allows calculation of Bellman=s errors which can be minimised in neural network fitting. The higher level optimisation and control problem in batch processing thus fits neatly into this framework and some results of a case study illustrate the potential of the approach.

The data unquestionably provide a useful source of information for supervisors and engineers to monitor the performance of the plant and identify opportunities for improvement and causes of poor performance. This contribution describes the use of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques for automatic analysis and interpretation of process operational data both in real time and over the operating history. Techniques studied include data pre-processing using wavelets and principal component analysis, multivariate statistical analysis, and unsupervised machine learning approaches as well as inductive learning for conceptual clustering. Examples and industrial case studies are used to illustrate these methods.

In effect, the genetic learning system. in this application is taking the place of a test pilot, in discovering complex maneuvers from experience. The goal of this work is distinct from that of many other studies, in that innovation, and discovery of novelty (as opposed to optimality), is in itself valuable. This makes the details of aims and techniques somewhat distinct from other genetics-based machine learning research. This paper presents previously unpublished results that show two co-adapting players in similar aircraft. The complexities of analyzing these results, given the red queen effect are discussed. Finally, general implications of this work are discussed.

Although many machine learning algorithms for data clustering have been proposed, none appear to specifically address the task of clustering moving data. The model we describe combines features of two existing computational models - that of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) and Sparse Distributed Memories (SDM). The model is evolved using a coevolutionary genetic algorithm that runs continuously in order to dynamically track clusters in the data. Although the system is very much in its infancy, the experiments conducted so far show that the system is capable of tracking moving clusters in artificial data sets, and also incorporates some memory of past clusters, The results suggest many possible directions for future research.

J	Cicekli, I; Guvenir, HA				Cicekli, I; Guvenir, HA			Learning translation templates from bilingual translation examples	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						exemplar based machine learning; example-based machine translation; corpus-based machine translation; templates		A mechanism for learning lexical correspondences between two languages from sets of translated sentence pairs is presented. These lexical level correspondences are learned using analogical reasoning between two translation examples. Given two translation examples, the similar parts of the sentences in the source language must correspond to the similar parts of the sentences in the target language. Similarly, the different parts must correspond to the respective parts in the translated sentences. The correspondences between similarities and between differences are learned in the form of translation templates. A translation template is a generalized translation exemplar pair where some components are generalized by replacing them with variables in both sentences and establishing bindings between these variables. The learned translation templates are obtained by replacing differences or similarities by variables. This approach has been implemented and tested on a set of sample training datasets and produced promising results for further investigation.

J	Reiser, PGK; Riddle, PJ				Reiser, PGK; Riddle, PJ			Scaling up inductive logic programming: An evolutionary wrapper approach	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Asian-Pacific Conference on Simulated Evolution and Learning (SEAL 98)	NOV 24-27, 1998	CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA			evolutionary algorithms; inductive logic programming; sampling; machine learning	ALGORITHMS	Inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithms are classification algorithms that construct classifiers represented as logic programs. ILP algorithms have a number of attractive features, notably the ability to make use of declarative background (user-supplied) knowledge. However, ILP algorithms deal poorly with large data sets (> 10(4) examples) and their widespread use of the greedy set-covering algorithm renders them susceptible to local maxima in the space of logic programs. This paper presents a novel approach to address these problems based on combining the local search properties of an inductive logic programming algorithm with the global search properties of an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed algorithm may be viewed as an evolutionary wrapper around a population of ILP algorithms. The evolutionary wrapper approach is evaluated on two domains. The chess-endgame (KRK) problem is an artificial domain that is a widely used benchmark in inductive logic programming, and Part-of-Speech Tagging is a real-world problem from the field of Natural Language Processing. In the latter domain, data originates from excerpts of the Wall Street Journal. Results indicate that significant improvements in predictive accuracy can be achieved over a conventional ILP approach when data is plentiful and noisy.

In the light of our medical staffs experience, the consequences of TIPS are not homogeneous for all the patients and a subgroup dies in the first six months after TIPS placement. An investigation for predicting the conduct of cirrhotic patients treated with TIPS is carried out using a clinical database with 107 cases and 77 attributes. We have applied a new Estimation of Distribution Algorithms based approach in order to perform a Prototype and Feature Subset Selection to improve the classification accuracy obtained using all the variables and all the cases. Used paradigms are K-Nearest Neighbours, Artificial Neural Networks and Classification Trees.

The controlled study involved a conventional conservative treatment, sham treatment, biphasic pulsed current, and direct current electrical stimulation. A quantity of available data suffices for an analysis with machine learning methods. So far only a limited number of studies have investigated the wound and patient attributes which affect the chronic wound healing. There is none to our knowledge to include the treatment attributes. The aims of our study are to determine effects of the wound, patient and treatment attributes on the wound healing process and to propose a system for prediction of the wound healing rate. In the first step of our analysis we determined which wound and patient attributes play a predominant role in the wound healing process. Then we investigated a possibility to predict the wound healing rate at the beginning of the treatment based on the initial wound, patient and treatment attributes. Finally we discussed the possibility to enhance the wound healing rate prediction accuracy by predicting it after a few weeks of the wound healing follow-up. By using the attribute estimation algorithms ReliefF and RReliefF we obtained a ranking of the prognostic factors which was comprehensible to field experts. We also used regression and classification trees to build models for prediction of the wound healing rate. The obtained results are encouraging and may form a basis of an expert system for the chronic wound healing rate prediction. If the wound healing rate is known, then the provided information can help to formulate the appropriate treatment decisions and orient resources to those individuals with poor prognosis.

While they often significantly outperform expert physicians (in terms of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity), they are mostly not used in practice. One reason for this is that it is difficult to obtain an unbiased estimation of diagnose's reliability. We propose a general framework for reliability estimation, based on transductive inference. We show that our reliability estimation is closely connected with a general notion of significance tests. We compare our approach with classical stepwise diagnostic process where reliability of diagnose is presented as its post-test probability. The presented approach is evaluated in practice in the problem of clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease, where significant improvements over existing techniques are achieved.

At the heart of quality of care programs lie prognostic models whose predictions for a particular patient population may be used as a norm to which actual outcomes of that population can be compared. This paper motivates and suggests a method based on Machine Learning and Statistical ideas to study the behavior of current IC prognostic models for predicting in-hospital mortality. An application of this method to an exemplary logistic regression model developed on the IC data from the National Intensive Care Evaluation registry reveals the model's weaknesses and suggests ways for developing improved prognostic models.

In this respect emphasis in this work is not on prediction and accuracy but rather on discovering paths to extraction of new insights and/or knowledge of the domain. The work demonstrates the use of unsupervised classification for the partitioning of the database with the aim of amplifying predictability of models describing expert classification, as well as boosting cause-and-effect relationships hidden in data.

The uncommon nature of these disorders renders it impossible to collect data of a sufficiently large number of patients to develop machine-learning models that faithfully reflect the subtleties of the domain. An alternative is to develop a Bayesian network with the help of clinical experts. Lack of data is then compensated for by eliciting the structure with its associated local probability distributions from the experts. The resulting network can be subsequently evaluated using the available dataset. One may also consider adopting very strong independence assumptions, such as in naive Bayesian models. Normally not all subtleties of the interactions among the variables in the domain are reflected in such models. Yet, a relatively small dataset suffices to obtain an acceptably accurate model. This paper explores the trade-offs between modelling using expert knowledge, and machine learning using a small clinical dataset in the context of Bayesian networks.

Initially, each classifier determines which portion of the data it is most competent in. The competency information is used to generated new data that axe used for further training and prediction. The application of this approach in a difficult to learn domain shows an increase in the predictive power, in terms of the accuracy and level of competency of both the ensemble and the component classifiers.

The concept of "meta-learning", i.e. of a system that improves or discovers a learning algorithm, has been of interest in machine learning for decades because of its appealing applications. Previous meta-learning approaches have been based on evolutionary methods and, therefore, have been restricted to small models with few free parameters. We make meta-learning in large systems feasible by using recurrent neural networks with their attendant learning routines as meta-learning systems. Our system derived complex well performing learning algorithms from scratch. In this paper we also show that our approach performs non-stationary time series prediction.

Our method exploits the "locality" of RBF kernels to update current machine by only considering a subset of support candidates in the neighbourhood of the input. The determination of this subset is conditioned by the computation of the variation of the error estimate. Implementation is based on the SMO one, introduced and developed by Platt [13]. We study the behaviour of the algorithm during learning when using different generalization error estimates. Experiments on three data sets (batch problems transformed into on-line ones) have been conducted and analyzed.

We discuss the representation of both board positions and candidate moves and introduce the common fate graph (CFG) as an adequate representation of board positions for learning. Single candidate moves are represented as feature vectors with features given by subgraphs relative to the given move in the CFG. Using this representation we train a support vector machine (SVM) and a kernel perceptron to discriminate good moves from bad moves on a collection of life-and-death problems and on 9 x 9 game records. We thus obtain kernel machines that solve Go problems and play 9 x 9 Go.

The first is Support Vector Machines (SVM), the second is Bayes Point Machines (BPM). We compare these algorithms based on strong mathematical results and nice geometrical arguments in a feature space to the simplest algorithm we could imagine working on the same representation. We use different low-level data, experimenting low-level preprocessing, including spatial information. Our results suggest that the kernel representation is more important than the algorithms used (at least for this task). It is a positive result because it exists much more simpler and faster algorithms than SVM. Our additive low-level preprocessings only improved success rate by few percents.

In the most complex of domains, long-term temporal dependencies are present. Neural network models such as LSTM have been developed to deal with long-term dependencies, but the continuous nature of neural networks is not well suited to discrete symbol processing tasks. Further, the mathematical underpinnings of neural networks are unclear, and gradient descent learning of recurrent neural networks seems particularly susceptible to local optima. We introduce a novel architecture for discovering dependencies in time. The architecture is formed by combining two variants of a hidden Markov model (HMM) - the factorial HMM and the input-output HMM - and adding a further strong constraint that requires the model to behave as a latch-and-store memory (the same constraint exploited in LSTM). This model, called an MIOFHMM, can learn structure that other variants of the HMM cannot, and can generalize better than LSTM on test sequences that have different statistical properties (different lengths, different types of noise) than training sequences. However, the MIOFHMM is slower to train and is more susceptible to local optima than LSTM.

Since labeled corpora are difficult to collect for this task, we propose a semi-supervised method, which makes use of a small set of labeled sentences together with a large set of unlabeled documents, for improving the performances of summary systems. We show that this method is an instance of the Classification EM algorithm in the case of gaussian densities, and that it can also be used in a non-parametric setting. We finally provide an empirical evaluation on the Reuters news-wire corpus.

The basic idea is to replace uncertain words in the transcriptions with a phoneme recognition result that is post-processed using a phoneme-to-grapheme converter. This converter turns phoneme strings into grapheme strings and is trained using machine learning techniques. Experiments show that, even when the grapheme strings are not fully correct, the resulting transcriptions are more easily readable than the original ones.

Since it's inception in 1990, NED has provided astronomers world-wide with the results of a systematic cross-correlation of catalogs covering all wavelengths, along with thousands of extragalactic observations culled from published journal articles. NED is continuously being expanded and revised to include new catalogs and published observations, each undergoing a process of cross-identification to capture the current state of knowledge about extragalactic sources in a panchromatic fashion. In addition to assimilating data from the literature, the team is incrementally folding in millions of observations from new large-scale sky surveys such as 2MASS, NVSS, APM, and SDSS. At the time of writing the system contains over 3.3 million unique objects with 4.2 million cross-identifications. We summarize the recent evolution of NED from its initial emphasis on object name-, position-, and literature-based queries into a research environment that also assists statistical data exploration and discovery using large samples of objects. Newer capabilities enable intelligent 'Web mining' of entries in geographically distributed astronomical archives that are indexed by object names and positions in NED, sample building using constraints on redshifts, object types and other parameters, as well as image and spectral archives for targeted or serendipitous discoveries. A pilot study demonstrates how NED is being used in conjunction with linked survey archives to characterize the properties of galaxy classes to form a training set for machine learning algorithms; an initial goal is production of statistical likelihoods that newly discovered sources belong to known classes, represent statistical outliers, or candidates for fundamentally new types of objects. Challenges and opportunities for tighter integration of NED capabilities into data mining tools for astronomy archives are also discussed.

While traditional cross-referencing consists in correcting catalog coordinates in order to seek nearest candidate, non-optical surveys tend to have lower resolutions and more coordinates uncertainties. Then, it seemed to be a loss not to use more light sources parameters obtained through image processing pipelines. A data mining approach based on decision trees (machine learning algorithms), we processed different FOCA/DPOSS sources pairs that we could suppose being the same stellar entity, and some other pairs, obviously too distant to match. Trees use every existing ultraviolet/optical parameter present on catalog, excluding only coordinates. The resulting trees allows a classification of any FOCA/DPOSS pair, giving a probability for the pair to match, i.e. come from the same source. The originality of this method is the use of non-position parameters, that can be used for cross-referencing various catalogs in different wavelength without the need to homogenize coordinates systems. Such methods could be tools for working on upcoming multi-wavelength catalogs.

This inverse problem is usually solved by least-squares fitting of the Stokes profiles. However least-squares inversion is too slow for the new generation of solar instruments (THEMIS, SOLIS, Solar-B,...) which will produce an ever-growing flood of spectral data. The solar community urgently requires a new approach capable of handling this information explosion, preferably in real-time. We have successfully applied pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to tackle this problem. For example, we have developed PCA-inversion, a database search technique based on Principal Component Analysis of the Stokes profiles. Search is fast because it is carried out in low dimensional PCA feature space, rather than the high dimensional space of the spectral signals. Such a data compression approach has been widely used for search and retrieval in many areas of data mining. PCA-inversion is the basis of a new inversion code called FATIMA (Fast Analysis Technique for the Inversion of Magnetic Atmospheres). Tests on data from HAO's Advanced Stokes Polarimeter show that FATIMA is over two orders of magnitude faster than least squares inversion. Initial tests on an alternative code (DIANNE - Direct Inversion based on Artificial Neural NEtworks) show great promise of achieving real-time performance. In this paper we present the latest achievements of FATIMA and DIANNE, two powerful examples of how pattern recognition techniques can revolutionize data analysis in astronomy.

The success of SVMs is mainly due to a number of attractive features, including a) applicability to the processing of high dimensional data, b) ability to achieve a global optimum, and c) the ability to deal with nonlinear data. One potential application for SVMs is High Range Resolution (HRR) radar signatures, typically used for HRR-based Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). HRR signatures are problematic for many traditional ATR algorithms because of the unique characteristics of HRR signatures. For example, HRR signatures are generally high dimensional, linearly inseparable, and extremely sensitive to aspect changes. In this paper we demonstrate that SVMs are a promising alternative in dealing with the challenges of HRR signatures. The studies presented in this paper represent an initial attempt at applying SVMs to HRR data. The most straightforward application of SVMs to HRR-based ATR is to use SVMs as classifiers. We experimentally compare the performance of SVM-based classifiers with several conventional classifiers, such as k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) classifiers and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Classifiers. Experimental results suggest that SVM classifiers possess a number of advantages. For example, a) applying SVM classifiers to HRR data requires little prior knowledge of the target data, b) SVM classifiers require much less computation than kNN classifiers during testing, and c) the structure of a trained SVM classifier can reveal a number of important properties of the target data.

Unfortunately, only a limited number of techniques for supporting this task by using machine learning techniques have been developed up to now. In this paper, a new framework for learning similarity measures is presented. The main advantage of this approach is its generality, because its application is not restricted to classification tasks in contrast to other already known algorithms. A first refinement of the introduced framework for learning feature weights is described and finally some preliminary experimental results are presented.

A block-oriented framework for modelling and optimisation of process chains is introduced and its applicability is shown by the results of the optimisation of cutting processes. The paper illustrates how the framework can support the simulation-based optimisation of whole production plants. The benefits of substituting the time-consuming simulation by ANN models are also outlined. The applicability of the proposed solution is demonstrated by the results of an industrial project where the task was to optimise the size spectrum of the ordered raw material at a plant producing one- and multi-layered printed wires.

The use of computer systems provides inherent sources of self-similarity traffic that result from the interactions of file transmissions, caching mechanisms, and user-related processes. These user-related processes are initiated by the user, application programs, or the operating system (OS) for the user's benefit. The effect of Web transmission patterns, coupled with these inherent sources of self-similarity associated with the above file system characteristics, provide an environment for studying network traffic. The goal of the study was client-based, but with no user interaction. New methodologies and approaches were needed as network packet traffic increased in the LAN, LAN+WAN, and WAN. Statistical tools and methods for analyzing datasets were used to organize data captured at the packet level for network traffic between individual source/destination pairs. Emulation of the evolutionary aspects of the biological model equips the experimental search engine with an adaptive system model which will eventually have the capability to evolve with an ever-changing World Wide Web (WWW) environment. The results were generated using a LINUX OS.

J	Rao, CR				Rao, CR			Statistics: Reflections on the past and visions for the future	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						Bayesian methods; Data Mining; decision theory; hypothesis testing; large data sets; machine learning; neural networks	TESTS	Statistics as data is ancient, but as a discipline of study and research it has a short history. Courses leading to degrees in statistics have been introduced in universities some sixty to seventy years ago. They were not considered to constitute a basic discipline with a subject matter of its own. However, during the last seventy five years, it has developed as a powerful blend of science, technology and art for solving problems in all areas of human endeavor. Now-a-days statistics is used in scientific research, economic development through optimum use of resources, increasing industrial productivity, 'medical diagnosis, legal practice, disputed authorship, and optimum decision making at individual and institutional levels. What is the future of statistics in the coming millennium dominated by information technology encompassing the whole of communications, interaction with intelligent systems, massive data bases, and complex information processing networks? The current statistical methodology based on probabilistic models applied on small data sets appears to be inadequate to meet the needs of the society in terms of quick processing of data and making the information available for practical purposes. Adhoc methods are being put forward under the title Data Mining by computer scientists and engineers to meet the needs of customers. The paper reviews the current state of the art in statistics and discusses possible future developments considering the availability of large data sets, enormous computing power and efficient optimization techniques using genetic algorithms and neural networks.

Moreover, many sensors are incapable of reliable decision-making on their awn. In such cases, a signal processing front-end that can match inference needs will be very helpful. The work is concerned with providing an object-oriented simulation environment for signal processing and neural network-based fault diagnosis and prognosis. In the toolbox, we implemented a wide range of spectral and statistical manipulation methods such as filters, harmonic analyzers, transient detectors, and multi-resolution decomposition to extract features for failure events from data collected by data sensors. Then we evaluated multiple learning paradigms for general classification, diagnosis and prognosis. The network models evaluated include Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) Neural Network, Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Decision Trees (C4.5), Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (FuzzyArtmap), Linear Discriminant Rule (LDR), Quadratic Discriminant Rule (QDR), Radial Basis Functions (RBF), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Single Layer Perceptrons (SLP). Validation techniques, such as N-fold cross-validation and bootstrap techniques, are employed for evaluating the robustness of network models. The trained networks are evaluated for their performance using test data on the basis of percent error rates obtained via cross-validation, time efficiency, generalization ability to unseen faults. Finally, the usage of neural networks for the prediction of residual life of turbine blades with thermal barrier coatings is described and the results are shown. The neural network toolbox has also been applied to fault diagnosis in mixed-signal circuits(16).

However, clinical prediction has not been reliable in spite of multiple assessment parameters such as symptom indices and flow rates. In this study, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are used to train computers to predict the surgical outcome in BPH patients treated by TURP or VLAP. Our aim is to investigate whether Al can reproduce the clinical outcome of known cases and assist the urologist in predicting surgical outcomes. Four different Al algorithms are used. In particular, we use three feed-forward methods, i.e. Shepard's k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayesian and ID3 decision tree, and one back-propagation Neural Network method. The programming was done in LISP, C++ and a relational database. In particular, 48 patients with known procedures and outcomes were used as training data. The data contained up to 11 questions (e.g. age, procedure, Qmax, AUA baseline score, PVR) with global assessment as outcome. The data was selected by a famous urologist. After loading and training the computer algorithms, the algorithms were tested using observed and unobserved examples to predict the outcome of the procedure. As a second part of the study the AI prediction was compared with the Urologist's prediction. We show that all four AI algorithms predicted known instances with an accuracy of 99%. There was little measurable differences between feed-forward only and back-propagation algorithms. Unobserved instances returned plausible outcomes. Finally experimental results are presented to show the power, versatility and robustness of the proposed AI techniques for predicting some surgical outcomes and therefore for improving patient outcome by better pre-treatment patient selection. We show that the techniques are robust to errors in the learning data set and provide more reliable information than arithmetic means or p-values. We also propose a prospective study, which is necessary to establish the clinical role of the proposed AI techniques based and its significant role in predicting surgical outcomes.

Due to the nature of the observed data and the available knowledge, the diagnostic and prognostic methods are often a combination of statistical inference and machine learning methods. The development (or selection) of appropriate methods requires appropriate formulation of the learning and inference problems that support the goals of diagnosis and prognosis. An important aspect of the formulation is modeling - relating the real system to its mathematical abstraction. This paper explores the impact of diagnostic and prognostic goals on modeling and reasoning system requirements, with the purpose of developing a common software framework that can be applied to a large class of systems. In particular, the role of failure-dependency modeling in the overall decision problem is discussed. The applicability of Qualtech Systems' modeling and diagnostic software tools to the presented framework for both the development and implementation of diagnostics and prognostics is assessed. Finally, a potential application concept for advancing the reliability of Navy shipboard Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) systems and processes is discussed.

In this concrete area of interest, the way in which different theories, each one produced either with the same algorithm or with many of them, are merged to produce a more accurate model has been the main topic. Now, new emerging techniques got more to do with inductive meta-learning. It is the process of learning from others learning experiences. This kind of learning imposes severe requisites, from the point of view of the software system that would support it. The purpose of this work is to show a software architecture for this type of learning. The architecture will give recommendations for building a system of this kind, that has to tackle with very precise but difficult problems at a time.

The focus of this paper are two main aspects: firstly, parameters of the environment are being extracted from a video image coming from one single camera which is installed in or in front of the vehicle which is to drive along the road course; secondly, the incoming images from the camera need to be processed by a computer system that way, that not only Steering Commands for the vehicle are being generated (for accelerator / brake as well as the steering wheel) but the appropriateness of those Steering Commands is being constantly weighed and continuously improved over time. Consequently, the current work focuses on a system which is able to learn and to develop completely on its own the ability to steer different vehicles in different environments and combines research in the areas of Intelligent Image Processing, Machine Learning and Robotics.

They are generally classified as generic noun phrases, definite noun phrases, and indefinite noun phrases. In the previous work, referential properties were estimated by developing rules that used clue words. If two or more rules were in conflict with each other, the category having the maximum total score given by the rules was selected as the desired category. The score given by each rule was established by hand, so the manpower cost was high, In this work, we automatically adjusted these scores by using a machine-learning method and succeeded in reducing the amount of manpower needed to adjust these scores.

We expand a state-of-the-art chunking algorithm to a bottom-up parser by recursively applying the chunker to its own output. After testing different training configurations we obtain a reasonable parser which is tested against a standard data set. Its performance falls behind that of current state-of-the-art parsers. We give some suggestions for modifications of the parser which may lead to future performance improvements.

In particular, the usefulness is investigated of the sequence of system question types and the word graphs corresponding to the respective user utterances. By applying both rule-induction and memory-based learning techniques to data obtained with a Dutch train time-table information system, the current paper demonstrates that the aforementioned features indeed lead to a method for problem detection that performs significantly above baseline. The results are interesting from a dialogue perspective since they employ features that are present in the majority of spoken dialogue systems and can be obtained with little or no computational overhead. The results are also interesting from a machine learning perspective, since they show that the rule-based method performs significantly better than the memory-based method, because the former is better capable of representing interactions between features.

The break-up is present in the organisation of information in books, libraries and on the Web. An on-line database of papers related to CAAD called CUMINCAD was created and it includes over 3000 papers with abstracts. They are available through the search interface - one knows an author or a keyword and can find the papers where such keyword or author's name appears. Alternative interface would be through browsing papers topic by topic. The papers, however, are not categorised. In this paper, we present the efforts to use the machine learning and data mining techniques to automatically group the papers into clusters and create a set of keywords that would label a cluster. The hypothesis was that an algorithm would create clusters of papers automatically and that the clusters would be similar to the groupings a human would have made. We investigated several algorithms for doing an analysis like that but were unable to prove the original hypothesis. We conclude that it requires more than objective statistical analysis of the words in abstracts to create an ontology of CAAD.

The classical empirical Bayes method supposes the form of the prior distribution of the parameter theta is given, and use the training date to estimate its hyperparameters, which ignores the error caused by the estimation. We consider the problem a Bayesian decision problem, and deal with it using loss function and risk, which will be better than the classical empirical Bayes method due to taking the error or loss into estimation. We also show that under certain conditions the Highest Posterior Belief (HPB) prior and the ML-II prior are Most Suitable Prior (MSP).

The result of series of machine, learning experiments is detection of some promising paroxysmal atrial fibrillation predictors Based on ratio of short and long R-R intervals there is a possibility to generate rules for PAF screening and predicting. For PAF screening the calculated ratio were 2.00 for successive R-R intervals. The problem of imminent PAF prediction is much more difficult and the concept of normalisation had to be implemented The optimal seems to be ratio between the shortest and the longest R-R interval, which was at least 1.75 times larger than ratio during the normalisation time for the same patient. Also it was detected that maximal distance of the longest and the shortest R-R intervals should be up to six R-R intervals.

J	Lee, J; Hajela, P				Lee, J; Hajela, P			Application of classifier systems in improving response surface based approximations for design optimization	COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES			English	Article								Emergent computing paradigms, such as genetic algorithms and neural networks have found increased use in problems of engineering design. These computational tools have been shown to be applicable in providing fast function approximations, in identifying causality in numerical data, and in the solution of generically difficult design optimization problems characterized by nonconvexities in the design space and the presence of discrete and integer design variables. Another aspect of these computational paradigms that have been lumped under the broad subject category of soft computing, is the domain of artificial intelligence, knowledge-based expert systems, and machine learning. The present paper explores the use of a machine learning paradigm, the central building blocks of which are tools, such as genetic algorithms and neural networks. Such learning systems have received some attention in the field of computer science, where they have been referred to as classifier systems; the paper discusses the significance of this approach in the problem of constructing high-quality global approximations for subsequent use in design optimization.

One of the first GBML implementations is the Learning Classifier System (LCS) defined by Goldberg [4]. Learning is done by the so called Bucket Brigade Algorithm (BBA) which assigns a strength (payoff value) to each classifier based upon its interaction with the environment. However, the BBA has also several severe limitations and can therefore only be succesfully applied to simple (discrete) problems, This paper introduces a new classifier system FECS based upon (several) classifier efficiency parameters. These parameters allow for a continuous (long term memory) evaluation of the classifiers and are also used to modify reward values based upon the average efficiency of the current population, Moreover, a new anticipatory mutation operator allows classifiers to mutate towards a probable better accuracy or generalism. The efficiency of FECS is demonstrated by applying it to an industrial production process. The resulting classifier set is shown to have an accuracy of 94%.

However, up to now only few approaches have been proposed for this task and most of them either are highly dependent on one domain or use manual rules. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning based approach that can be trained for different domains and requires almost no manual rules. We adopt a dependency grammar - Link Grammar [2] - for this purpose. The link structures of the grammar are very similar to conceptual graphs. Based on the link structure, through the word-conceptualization, concept-folding, link-folding and relationalization operations, we can train the system to generate conceptual graphs from domain specific sentences. An implementation system of the method is currently under development with IBM China Research Lab.

We define a Logical Information System that combines navigation and querying for searching for objects. Places and queries are unified as formal concepts represented by logical formulas. Answers can be both extensional (objects belonging to a concept) and intensional (formulas refining a concept). Thus, all facets of navigation are formalized in terms of Logical Concept Analysis. We show that the definition of being a refinement of some concept is a specific case of Knowledge Discovery in a formal context. It can be generalized to recover more classical KD operations like machine-learning through the computation of necessary or sufficient properties (modulo some confidence), or data-mining through association rules.

J	Wallis, S; Nelson, G				Wallis, S; Nelson, G			Knowledge discovery in grammatically analysed corpora	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						linguistics; grammar; structured datasets; Text Corpora; redescription; cyclic knowledge discovery		Collections of grammatically annotated texts (corpora), and in particular, parsed corpora, present a challenge to current methods of analysis. Such corpora are large and highly structured heterogeneous data sources. In this paper we briefly describe the parsed one-million word ICE-GB corpus, and the ICECUP query system. We then consider the application of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) to text corpora. Following Cupit and Shadbolt (Proceedings 9th European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop, EKAW '96; Berlin: Springer Verlag, pp. 245-261, 1996), we argue that effective linguistic knowledge discovery must be based on a process of redescription or, more precisely, abstraction, based on the research question to be investigated. Abstraction maps relevant elements from the corpus to an abstract model of the research topic. This mapping may be implemented using a grammatical query representation such as ICECUP's Fuzzy Tree Fragments (FTFs). Since this abstractive process must be both experimental and expert-guided, ultimately a workbench is necessary to maintain, evaluate and refine the abstract model. We conclude with a pilot study, employing our approach, into aspects of noun phrase postmodifying clause structure. The data is analysed using the UNIT machine learning algorithm to search for significant interactions between domain variables. We show that our results are commensurable with those published in the linguistics literature, and discuss how the methodology may be improved.

Our entire existence is LI process of gathering, analyzing, understanding and acting on the information. For many applications dealing with large amount of data, Pattern classification is a key element in arriving or the solution. Engineering applications like SONAR, RADAR, SEISMIC and medical diagnosis require the ability to accurately classify the recorded data for controlling, tracking and decision making respectively. Although modern technologies enable storage of large sir-earns of data, Mie do not yet have a technology to help us to understand, analyse, or even visualize the hidden information in the data. Data Mining is now the emerging field attracting all research communities. Pattern classification is one particular category of Data Mining, which enables the Discovery of Knowledge from Very Large Databases (VLDB). Modern developments in hardware and software technologies have paved way for developing the software for analyzing and visualizing the data. This development is based on the application of data mining concept. Artificial Neural Networks are used to mine the data base which has better noise immunity and lesser training lime The paper aims mainly at classification accuracy with reduction in learning time using self-organizing neural networks. The newness in the concept of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) makes this cls the best and efficient approach for classification. In the first phase, the ART network was constructed. The pruning phase aims at removing redundant links and units without increasing the classification error rate of the network. The final phase extracts the classification rules from the final weights of the pruned network in the form of IF- THEN rules. Finally the extracted rules have been validated for its correctness. Moreover the rules extracted from this network is very simple compared to BPN approach. The performance evaluation of the networks have been done and compared with conventional methods. Simulation is carried out using the letter recognition data base taken from the UCI repository of machine learning data bases.

It has been applied in such fields as machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analyzing and control algorithm acquiring successfully. Many researchers have studied rough sets in different view. In this paper, the algebra view and information view of rough set theory are analyzed and compared with each other systematically. Some equivalence relations and other kind of relations such as inclusion relations are resulted through comparing study. For example, the reduction under algebra view will be equivalent to the reduction under information view if the decision table is consistent. Otherwise, the reduction under information view will include the reduction under algebra view. These results will be useful for designing heuristic reduction algorithms.

Data mining is the emerging field that helps us to understand and analyse the hidden information from? Very Large Databases(VLDB). In this paper, two important mining tools (i.e) Neural networks and Genetic algorithm. have Been used for mining the database through pattern classification, The processing methodology consists of three major phases. Network construction and training, Pruning Rule extraction and validation. The networks used are namely Adaptive Resonance Theory 1.5, Adaptive Resonance Theory 3 and Multi Channel ART(MART). These networks belong to the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) family, which is a self organising neural network capable of clustering arbitrary sequence of input patterns into stable recognition codes, The pruning phase aims at removing redundant links and units without increasing the classification error rate of the network The pruning methods adopted are Local pruning and Threshold pruning. The final phase extracts the classification rules from the final weights of the pruned network in the form of IF THEN rules and rules are validated using validation algorithm. The genetic algorithm is also used to optimise the performance with regard to the various parameters used in the network. The performance analysis and comparision of all the networks have been done. The proposed networks have been tested on Letter recognition data application taken from UCI machine learning site. Simulation algorithms have been input implemented C++ language in the Pentium machine. The graphic results have been obtained using MicroSoft Excel.

Data mining has attracted considerable attention both in the research and commercial arenas in recent years, involving the application of a variety of techniques from both computer science and statistics. The chapter discusses how computer scientists and statisticians approach data from different but complementary viewpoints and highlights the fundamental differences between statistical and computational views of data mining. In doing so we review the historical importance of statistical contributions to machine learning and data mining, including neural networks, graphical models, and flexible predictive modeling. The primary conclusion is that closer integration of computational methods with statistical thinking is likely to become increasingly important in data mining applications.

The global Internet/World Wide Web exemplifies the rapid deployment of such technologies. Despite significant accomplishments in internetworking, however, scalable indexing and data-ruining techniques for computational knowledge management lag behind the rapid growth of distributed collections. Hierarchical Distributed Dynamic Indexing (HDDI (TM)) is an approach that dynamically creates a hierarchical index from distributed document collections. At each node of the hierarchical index, a knowledge base is created and subtopic regions of semantic locality in conceptual space are identified. This chapter introduces HDDI (TM), focusing on the model building techniques employed at each node of the hierarchy. A novel approach to information clustering based on the contextual transitivity of similarity between terms is introduced. We conclude with several example applications of HDDI (TM) in the textual data mining and information retrieval fields.

In this regard, we have been exploring ways of modifying machine learning techniques so that the resulting predictive models likewise reflect the empirical characteristics of observed data. Following the principles of robust estimation, our methodology involves first examining the data to identify an appropriate family of statistical distributions for modeling the data, and then incorporating the corresponding maximum-likelihood estimation procedures into a decision tree algorithm. We have applied this methodology to insurance risk modeling and have obtained tree-based models superior to those obtained using conventional classification and regression tree algorithms.

In the past few years, extensive research was done in the database community on learning rules using exhaustive search under the name of association rule mining. The objective there is to find all rules in data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence. Although the whole set of rules may not be used directly for accurate classification, effective and efficient classifiers have been built using the rules. This paper aims to improve such an exhaustive search based classification system CBA (Classification Based on Associations). The main strength of this system is that it is able to use the most accurate rules for classification. However, it also has weaknesses. This paper proposes two new techniques to deal with these weaknesses. This results in remarkably accurate classifiers. Experiments on a set of 34 benchmark datasets show that on average the new techniques reduce the error of CBA by 17% and is superior to CBA on 26 of the 34 datasets. They reduce the error of the decision tree classifier C4.5 by 19%, and improve performance on 29 datasets. Similar good results are also achieved against the existing classification systems, RIPPER, LB and a Naive-Bayes classifier.

The model integrates traditional text summarization and text classification in that the digest not only serves as a "summary" but is also able to classify text segments of any given size, and answer queries relative to a context. "Pyramidal" refers to the fact that the digest is created in at least three dimensions: scope, granularity, and scale. The Pyramidal Digest is defined recursively as a structure of extracted and abstracted features that are obtained gradually - from specific to general, and from large to small text segment size - through a combination of shallow parsing and machine learning algorithms. There are three noticeable threads of learning taking place: learning of characteristic relations, rhetorical relations, and lexical relations. Our model provides a principle for efficiently digesting large quantities of text: progressive learning can digest text by abstracting its significant features. This approach scales, with complexity bounded by O(n log n), where n is the size of the text. It offers a standard and systematic way of collecting as many semantic features as possible that are reachable by shallow parsing. It enables readers to query beyond keyword matches.

In spite of the high expressiveness, application systems built upon ORDBMS are more complex and difficult to maintain due to the mixing of two paradigms, the relational and the object-oriented. This paper describes a suite of metrics for measuring different aspects of an object-relational database. An empirical validation of the usefulness of the proposed metrics in estimating the understandability of an object-relational schema is given. The analysis procedure comprises the use of two techniques: C4.5, a machine learning algorithm, and RoC, a robust Bayesian classifier. The results demonstrate that a subset of the proposed measures is relevant for the estimation of the understandability.

This paper describes some preliminary results concerning the robustness and generalization capabilities of machine learning methods in creating user profiles based on the selection and subsequent classification of command line arguments. We base our method on the belief that legitimate users can be classified into categories based on the Percentage of commands they use in a specified period. The hybrid approach we employ begins with the application of expert rules to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by an initial clustering of the data and subsequent refinement of the cluster locations using a competitive network called Learning Vector Quantization. Since Learning Vector Quantization is a nearest neighbor classifier, and new record presented to the network that lies outside a specified distance is classified as a masquerader. Thus, this system does not require anomalous records to be included in the training set.

These statistical approximations, or metamodels, are used to replace the actual expensive computer analyses, facilitating multidisciplinary, multiobjective optimization and concept exploration. In this paper, we review several of these techniques, including design of experiments, response surface methodology, Taguchi methods, neural networks, inductive learning and kriging. We survey their existing application in engineering design, and then address the dangers of applying traditional statistical techniques to approximate deterministic computer analysis codes. We conclude with recommendations for the appropriate use of statistical approximation techniques in given situations, and how common pitfalls can be avoided.

The main drawbacks of these algorithms are that they are notoriously slow and that they bring no understanding on the behavior of the system. So we propose to add to these algorithms a machine learning module, which can highlights several critical parameters and guide then the research of solution. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated through the example of optimizing an assembly kanban system.

Three objectives are to maximize the performance of an extracted rule set, to minimize the number of extracted rules, and to minimize the total length of extracted rules. The second and third objectives are related to comprehensibility of the extracted rule set. We describe and compare two genetic- algorithm-based approaches for finding non-dominated rule sets with respect to the three objectives of our linguistic rule extraction problem. One approach is rule selection where a small number of linguistic rules are selected from prespecified candidate rules. The other is genetics-based machine learning where rule sets are evolved by generating new rules from existing ones using genetic operations.

J	Fuentes, O				Fuentes, O			Automatic determination of stellar atmospheric parameters using neural networks and instance-based machine learning	EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						data analysis; ensembles; instance-based machine learning; neural networks; stellar atmospheric parameters	SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION	In this article we show how machine learning methods can be effectively applied to the problem of automatically predicting stellar atmospheric parameters from spectral information, a very important problem in stellar astronomy. We apply feedforward neural networks, Kohonen's self-organizing maps and locally-weighted regression to predict the stellar atmospheric parameters effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity from spectral indices. Our experimental results show that the three methods are capable of predicting the parameters with very good accuracy. Locally weighted regression gives slightly better results than the other methods using the original dataset as input, while self-organizing maps outperform the other methods when significant amounts of noise are added. We also implemented a heterogeneous ensemble of predictors, combining the results given by the three algorithms.

This method uses a genetic algorithm (GA) for the selection of relevant spectral indices and prototypical stars and predicts their properties, using the k-nearest neighbors method (KNN). We have applied the method to predict the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, luminosity class and spectral class of stars from spectral indices. Our experimental results show that the feature selection performed by the genetic algorithm reduces the running time of KNN up to 92%, and the predictive accuracy error up to 35%.

It has been applied successfully to classification tasks such as pattern recognition, OCR and more recently also to regression and time series. In recent years, a number of non-linear classification and regression SVMs have been developed and these have been benchmarked against artificial neural networks (ANNs). It has been found that the empirical performance of SVMs is generally as good as the best ANN solutions. Compared with traditional artificial neural networks, learning in SVMs is very robust from the point of view of the precision of the computations. This paper describes the attempt of using Support Vector Machines approach for river flow modelling. Mathematically, SVMs are a range of classification and regression algorithms that have been formulated from the principles of statistical learning theory. The nonlinearity and learning abilities in the SVM technique are useful features that could be applied to many areas in future hydraulic and hydrological engineering.

Roughly speaking, the basic idea is to evaluate a control (a therapeutic policy or modality) which has, on the average, proved to work well for similar patients in the database. By "similar" is meant patients who have the same covariates and who are in similar dynamical states. These concepts will be made more precise in the paper. The proposed stochastic analysis and control approach for databases is new, although it is motivated by methods of machine learning put forth in [1][2] and methods of dynamic programming for stochastic control given in [3][4].

To identify possible quantitative trait loci (QTL), the quantitative traits were analyzed using SOLAR. The four replicates identified as the "best replicates" by the simulators, 42, 25, 33, and 38, were analyzed separately. Each of the five quantitative phenotypes was analyzed individually in the four replicates. To increase the power to detect QTL with pleiotropic effects, principal component analysis was performed and one new multivariate phenotype was estimated. In each instance, after performing a 10-cM genome screen, fine mapping was completed in the initially identified linked regions to further evaluate the evidence for linkage. This approach of initially performing a coarse marker screen followed by analyses using much higher marker density successfully identified all the QTL playing a role in the quantitative phenotypes. The principal component phenotype did not substantially improve the power of QTL detection or localization. A neural network approach was utilized to identify loci contributing to disease status. The neural network technique identified the strongest gene influencing disease status as well as a locus contributing to quantitative traits 3 and 4; however, the inputs that contributed the greatest information were markers not in QTL regions.

We have found that humans can effectively estimate certain surface reflectance properties from a single image without knowledge of illumination. We develop a machine vision system to perform similar reflectance estimation tasks automatically. The problem of estimating reflectance from single images under unknown, complex illumination proves highly underconstrained due to the variety of potential reflectances and illuminations. Our solution relies on statistical regularities in the spatial structure of real-world illumination. These regularities translate into predictable relationships between surface reflectance and certain statistical features of the image. We determine these relationships using machine learning techniques. Our algorithms do not depend on color or polarization; they apply even to monochromatic imagery. An ability to estimate reflectance under uncontrolled illumination will further efforts to recognize materials and surface properties, to capture computer graphics models from photographs, and to generalize classical motion and stereo algorithms such that they can handle non-Lambertian surfaces.

Our hypothesis is that the eye movements of human observers differ for images of different semantic categories, and that this information can be effectively used in automatic content-based classifiers. First, we present eye tracking experiments that show the variations in eye movements (i.e., fixations and saccades) across different individuals for images of 5 different categories: handshakes (two people shaking hands), crowd (cluttered scenes with many people), landscapes (nature scenes without people), main object in uncluttered background (e.g., an airplane flying), and miscellaneous (people and still lives). The eye tracking results suggest that similar viewing patterns occur when different subjects view different images in the same semantic category. Using these results, we examine how empirical data obtained from eye tracking experiments across different semantic categories can be integrated with existing computational frameworks, or used to construct new ones. In particular, we examine the Visual Apprentice, a system in which image classifiers are learned (using machine learning) from user input as the user defines a multiple level object definition hierarchy based on an object and its parts (scene, object, object-part, perceptual area, region), and labels examples for specific classes (e.g., handshake). The resulting classifiers are applied to automatically classify new images (e.g., as handshake/non-handshake). Although many eye tracking experiments have been performed, to our knowledge, this is the first study that specifically compares eye movements across categories, and that links category-specific eye tracking results to automatic image classification techniques.

We then use the features as inputs for a Bayesian neural network (BNN) and apply the BNN to classifying protein sequences obtained from the PIR (Protein Information Resource) database maintained at the National Biomedical Research Foundation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we compare if with other protein classifiers built based on sequence alignment and machine learning methods. Experimental results show the high precision of the proposed classifier and the complementarity of the bioinformatics tools studied in the paper.

The ontology is considered as a complete schema of the application domain concepts as they are used in the analyzed Web pages. The concepts are classified into entity types, relationships, attributes, and superclass/subclass hierarchies and stored in a relational database to allow them to evolve over time. This paper describes the WebOntEx project, and its architecture and main component module. We utilize machine-learning techniques, in particular inductive logic programming, in the WebOntEx Heuristic Analyzer module. The extracted ontologies can be used in various important applications, such as understanding Web information content, querying Web meta-data, more intelligent Web searching, and conversion of HTML Web pages to other formats, such as XML.

Looking back at the huge developments in the past 10 years, it's hard to see where the web will be in the next 10, not to mention the next 5. The rapid growth in new websites, with thousands of new sites appearing every week, is putting a strain on the search engines as their technology tries to keep up with the growth. Estimates place the coverage of the web by search engines to be no more than 40-50% of total web pages. The coverage itself is not satisfying the users anymore. Search engines need better and more efficient techniques to provide relevant information to the users. The information obtained by these engines as response to the search goals and queries issued by the users of the Web does not seem to as relevant as it should be. Hence, users are flooded by unreleveant information and unrelated pages. To address these problems, several improvements were explored by the researchers and designers of the Web tools. These solutions range from improving the performance of the existing search engines to developing search agents. This paper presents these solutions and claims that a further improvement should be in the form of incorporating intelligent techinques, such as heuristics, pattern matching, and machine learning, in the design of future search engines to provide them with ability to discover various access patterns of their users, recognize their behavior, and build a model of their interests, and then use this model to automatically acquire relavant information from the Web. We present a design framework for such an intelligent search engine and discuss the differences between our design and that of similar search systems.

We propose a machine learning approach that uses a fuzzy binary decision tree instead of the more classical binary decision tree. After presenting this novel approach, we describe an example application that investigates the stability of a class library interface, as we move form version to version of the library, using structural metrics as stability indicators. We conducted a study on different versions of a commercial C++ class library using both a standard binary tree approach and our fuzzy logic approach; the obtained results are very promising when comparing the No methods.

The algorithms are compared using a number of salient features. These features include generalisation, sensitivity to producing the same set of rules, robustness to noise, irrelevant value problem, missing branches problem, bias problem, simplicity, and nature of induction process. Speed of inferencing and time complexity of extracting rules using various inductive learning algorithms are discussed. Good classification accuracy is vital for a number of applications, the algorithms are tested on IRIS data set for classification accuracy comparison. The size of the set of rules is important to fast inferencing, a comparison of the size of the set of rules obtained by the five main types of algorithms on IRIS data set is performed.

If the attributes are continuous, the algorithms can be integrated with a discretization algorithm that transforms them into discrete attributes. The paper describes an algorithm, called CAIM (class-attribute interdependence maximization), for discretization of continuous attributes that is designed to work with supervised learning algorithms. The algorithm maximizes the class-attribute interdependence and, at the same time, generates possibly minimal number of discrete intervals. Its big advantage is that it does not require the user to pre-define the number of intervals, in contrast to many existing discretization algorithms. The CAIM algorithm and five other state-of-the-art discretization algorithms were tested on well-known machine learning datasets consisting of continuous and mixed-mode attributes. The tests show that the proposed algorithm generates discrete attributes with, almost always, the highest class-attribute interdependency when compared with other algorithms, and at the same time it always generates the lowest number of intervals. The discretized datasets were used in conjunction with the CLIP4 machine learning algorithm. The accuracy of the rules generated by the CLIP4 shows that the proposed algorithm significantly improves classification performance; it also performs best in comparison with other five discretization algorithms. The CAIM algorithm's speed is comparable to the simplest unsupervised algorithms and outperforms other supervised discretization algorithms.

Unlike the usual approaches to skill reconstruction or reinforcement learning methods, we learn qualitative control strategies. Qualitative strategies are induced by an algorithm QUIN (QUalitative INduction) that learns qualitative trees from numerical examples. At difference with decision trees that are often used in machine learning, the leaves of qualitative trees contain qualitative functional constraints. We apply QUIN to the learning of qualitative strategies in the domain of a container crane dynamic system and show that qualitative strategies are comprehensible and provide a space for controller optimization.

Initially Learner knows neither the effects of its actions nor the properties of the objects in its world. Furthermore, Learner does not have an explicit representation of its environment. Instead it uses the world as its own model. The agent is given restricted abilities to perceive and to move, and the rules of death and survival. It explores its world, and through trial-and-error learns its properties. As a result Learner can survive indefinitely in low-risk worlds and lives long enough to be called intelligent in the highest-risk worlds. Learner is a reinforcement learning agent: it does not have a teacher; in-stead it employs a condition-action component, where the action evaluation is the reinforcement. This is an LPA Prolog implementation developed in V-world, an agent-testing computer environment featuring various simulated worlds.

One of them is that the induced concept representation is not usually comprehensible to humans. Several techniques have been suggested to extract meaningful knowledge front trained ANNs. This paper proposes the use of symbolic learning algorithms, commonly used by the Machine Learning community, to extract symbolic representations front trained ANNs.

A population of trees is evolved by employing the genetic operators and every individual is evaluated by using a fitness function based on the J-measure. The method is able to deal with large data sets since it uses a parallel implementation of genetic programming through the grid model and an out of core technique for those data sets that do not fit in main memory. Preliminary experiments on data sets from the UCI machine learning repository give good classification outcomes and asses the scalability of the method.

Commonly, each of them is specialized to serve a different purpose or address specific difficulties. However, most combinatorial problems that model real world applications have a priori well known measurable properties. Embedded machine learning methods may aid towards the recognition and utilization of these properties for the achievement of satisfactory solutions, In this paper we present a heuristic methodology which employs the instance-based machine learning paradigm, This methodology can be adequately configured for several types of optimization problems which are known to have certain properties. Experimental results are discussed concerning two well known problems, namely the knapsack problem and the set partitioning problem. These results show that the proposed approach is able to find significantly better solutions compared to intuitive search methods based on heuristics which are usually applied to the specific problems.

Currently, the combination of several classifiers is one of the most active fields within inductive machine learning. Examples of such techniques are boosting, bagging and stacking. From these three techniques, stacking is perhaps the less used one. One of the main reasons for this relates to the difficulty to define and parameterize its components: selecting which combination of base classifiers to use, and which classifier to use as the meta-classifier One could use for that purpose simple search methods (e.g. hill climbing), or more complex ones (e.g. genetic algorithms). But before search is attempted, it is important to know the properties of the search space itself In this paper we study exhaustively the space of Stacking systems that can be built by using four base learning systems: C4.5, IB1, Naive Bayes, and PART The results that have been obtained in this paper will be useful for designing new Stacking-based algorithms and tools.

J	Leung, Y; Ma, JH; Zhang, WX				Leung, Y; Ma, JH; Zhang, WX			A new method for mining regression classes in large data sets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data mining; genetic algorithm; maximum likelihood method; mixture modeling; RCMD method; regression class; robustness	ROBUST ESTIMATOR; COMPUTER VISION; PERSPECTIVE; LIKELIHOOD; MIXTURES	Extracting patterns and models of interest from targe databases is attracting much attention in a variety of disciplines. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) are areas of common interest to researchers in machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, artificial intelligence, and high performance computing. An effective and robust method, coined regression-class mixture decomposition (RCMD) method, is proposed in this paper for the mining of regression classes in large data sets, especially those contaminated by noise. A new concept, called "regression class" which is defined as a subset of the data set that is subject to a regression model, is proposed as a basic building block on which the mining process is based. A large data set is treated as a mixture population in which there are many such regression classes and others not accounted for by the regression models. Iterative and genetic-based algorithms for the optimization of the objective function in the RCMD method are also constructed. It is demonstrated that the RCMD method can resist a very large proportion of noisy data. identify each regression class. assign an inlier set of data points supporting each identified regression class, and determine the a priori unknown number of statistically valid models in the data set. Although the models are extracted sequentially, the final result is almost independent of the extraction order due to a novel dynamic classification strategy employed in the handling of overlapping regression classes. The effectiveness and robustness of the RCMD method are substantiated by a set of simulation experiments and a real-life application showing the way it can be used to fit mixed data to linear regression classes and nonlinear structures in various situations.

Our approach, which obtains state of the art results, is based on a new neural network model: the Constrained Generative Model (CGM). Generative, since the goal of the learning process is to evaluate the probability that the model has generated the input data, and constrained since some counterexamples are used to increase the quality of the estimation performed by the model. To detect side view faces and to decrease the number of false alarms, a conditional mixture of networks is used. To decrease the computational time cost, a fast search algorithm is proposed. The level of performance reached, in terms of detection accuracy and processing time, allows to apply this detector to a real world application: the indexation of images and videos.

Results are obtained for eight different classification problems from the UCI repository machine learning databases. Our results show that the usual codification is superior to the rest in the case of using one output unit per class. However, if we use several output units per class we can obtain an improvement in the generalization performance depending on the problem and in this case the noisy codification seems to be more appropriate.

The goal of this study is to propose a machine learner that is both incrementally retrainable and comprehensible through integration of decision trees and neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a kind of neural network trees (NNTrees), propose algorithms for their training and retraining, and verify the efficiency of the algorithms through experiments with a digit recognition problem.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council			NEURAL NETWORKS	A new approach to training a generalized Hopfield network is developed and evaluated in this work. Both the weight symmetricity constraint and the zero self-connection constraint are removed from standard Hopfield networks, Training is accomplished with Back-Propagation Through Time, using noisy versions of the memorized patterns. Training in this way is referred to as Noisy Associative Training (NAT). Performance of NAT is evaluated on both random and correlated data. NAT has been tested on several data sets, with a large number of training runs for each experiment. The data sets used include uniformly distributed random data and several data sets adapted from the UC. Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Results show that for random patterns, Hopfield networks trained with NAT have an average overall recall accuracy 6.1 times greater than networks produced with either Hebbian or Pseudo-Inverse training, Additionally, these networks have 13% fewer spurious memories on average than networks trained with Pseudo-Inverse or Hebbian training. Typically, networks memorizing over 2N (where N is the number of nodes in the network) patterns are produced. Performance on correlated data shows an even greater improvement over networks produced with either Hebbian or Pseudo-Inverse training - An average of 27.8 times greater recall accuracy, with 14% fewer spurious memories.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				This paper introduces gradient descent methods applied to meta-learning (learning how to learn) in Neural Networks. Meta-learning has been of interest in the machine learning field for decades because of its appealing applications to intelligent agents, non-stationary time series, autonomous robots, and improved learning algorithms. Many previous neural network-based approaches toward meta-learning have been based on evolutionary methods. We show how to use gradient descent for meta-learning in recurrent neural networks. Based on previous work on Fixed-Weight Learning Neural Net-works, we hypothesize that any recurrent network topology and its corresponding learning algorithm(s) is a potential meta-learning system. We tested several recurrent neural net-work topologies and their corresponding forms of Backpropagation for their ability to meta-learn. One of our systems, based on the Long Short-Term Memory neural network developed a learning algorithm that could learn any two-dimensional quadratic function (from a set of such functions) after only 30 training examples.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				Customer churn, switching from one service provider to another, costs the wireless telecommunications industry $4 billion each year in North America and Europe. To proactively build lasting relationships with customers, it is thus crucial to predict customer behavior. Machine learning has been applied to churn prediction, using historical data such as usage, billing, customer service, and demographics. However, because customer behavior is often nonstationary, training a model based on data extracted from a window of time in the past yields poor performance on the present. We propose two distinct approaches, using more historical data or new, unlabeled data, to improve the results for this real-world, large-scale, nonstationary problem. A new ensemble classification method, with combination weights learned from both labeled and unlabeled data, is also proposed, and it outperforms Bagging and Mixture of Experts.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				The game Go has simple rules to learn hut requires complex strategies to play well, and, the conventional tree search algorithm for computer games is not suited for Go program. Thus, the game Go is an ideal problem domain for machine learning algorithms. This paper examines the performance of a 19x19 computer Go player, using heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) and parallel Alpha-Beta search. The neural network based Go player learns good Go evaluation functions and wins about 30% of the games in a test series on 19x19 board.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				This paper illustrates a new approach to sensitivity analysis for feature selection using multiple ensemble neural networks in a bootstrapping mode with bagging. This methodology is applied to in-silico drug design with QSAR (Quantitative Structural Activity Relationship), which is notoriously challenging for machine learning because typically there are on the order of 300-1000 dependent features, often for as few as 50 - 100 data points. For an HIV dataset with 160 wavelets descriptors, the number of relevant features was reduced to 35, and the resulting predictive neural network model gave better results than with the full feature set.

The need to measure the continuing impact of the fire on the local environment has led to the application of a number of remote sensing technologies. During and after the fire, remote-sensing data was acquired from a variety of aircraft- and satellite-based sensors, including Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). We now report on the application of a machine learning technique to the automated classification of land cover using multi-spectral and multi-temporal imagery. We apply a hybrid genetic programming/supervised classification technique to evolve automatic feature extraction algorithms. We use a software package we have developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, called GENIE, to carry out this evolution. We use multispectral imagery from the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument from before and after the wildfire. Using an existing land cover classification based on a 1992 Landsat 5 TM scene for our training data, we evolve algorithms that distinguish a range of land cover categories, and an algorithm to mask out clouds and cloud shadows. We report preliminary results of combining individual classification results using a K-means clustering approach. The details of our evolved classification are compared to the manually produced land-cover classification.

However, many of these services still exhibit rather poor quality in terms of unacceptable performance during load peaks, frequent and long outages, and unsatisfactory search results. For the next decade, the overriding goal of database research should be to provide means for building zero-administration, self-tuning information services with predictable response time, virtually continuous availability, and, ultimately, "moneyback" service-quality guarantees. A, particularly challenging aspect of this theme is the quality of search results in digital libraries, scientific data repositories, and on the Web. To aim for more intelligent search that can truly find needles in haystacks, classical information retrieval methods should be integrated with querying capabilities for structurally richer Web data, most notably XML data, and automatic classification methods based on standardized ontologies and statistical machine learning. This paper gives an overview of promising research directions along these lines.

Since almost everyone speaks and understands a language, the development of natural language systems will allow the average person to interact with computers anytime and anywhere without special skills or training, using common devices such as a mobile telephone. The latest results and component technologies for multilingual and robust speech processing, prosodic analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse understanding, translation, and speech synthesis are reviewed using the Verbmobil system as an example. Verbmobil is a speaker-independent and bidirectional speech-to-speech translation system for spontaneous dialogs in mobile situations. It recognizes spoken input, analyses and translates it, and finally utters the translation. The multilingual system handles dialogs in three business-oriented domains, with context-sensitive translation between three languages (German, English, and Japanese). We will show that the most successful current systems are based on hybrid architectures incorporating both deep and shallow processing schemes. They integrate a broad spectrum of statistical and rule-based methods and combine the results of machine learning from large corpora with linguists' hand-crafted knowledge sources to achieve an adequate level of robustness and accuracy. We argue that packed representations together with formalisms for underspecification capture the uncertainties in each processing phase, so that these uncertainties can be reduced by linguistic, discourse and domain constraints as soon as they become applicable. We show that the current core technologies for natural language and speech processing enable us to create the next generation of information extraction and summarization systems for the Web, speech-based Internet access and multimodal communication assistants combining speech and gesture.

TC has been an application for many learning approaches, which prove effective. Nevertheless, TC provides many challenges to machine learning. In this paper, we suggest, for text categorization, the integration of external WordNet lexical information to supplement training data for a semi-supervised clustering algorithm which can learn from both training and test documents to classify new unseen documents. This algorithm is the "Semi-Supervised Fuzzy c-Means" (ssFCM). Our experiments use Reuters 21578 database and consist of binary classifications for categories selected from the 115 TOPICS classes of the Reuters collection. Using the Vector Space Model, each document is represented by its original feature vector augmented with external feature vector generated using WordNet. We verify experimentally that the integration of WordNet helps ssFCM improve its performance, effectively addresses the classification of documents into categories with few training documents and does not interfere with the use of training data.

The input data are vibration signals from different points of washing machine's surface when it operates for a couple of minutes in centrifuge mode. The signal is normalized and transformed to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). An adequate example database is constructed from samples of different machine status. Our approach lends basic concepts contained in the algorithmic family of ID3 and C4.5. Certain parts of the algorithmic process contained in the above machine learning tools are used in order to construct a feature selection methodology based on information entropy criteria. The selected features are then used by specific classification techniques for achieving successful discrimination among different types of fault and normal operation. The overall methodology, using real data acquired within the European Community funded project called MEDEA, obtains a high rate of fault detection exceeding 87% of successful classification.

Current drug design methodologies can take several years just in the initial chemical evaluation stages before compounds can be created for animal and human testing. This paper presents some recent research results in a new parallel machine learning approach that can expedite the drug design cycle. This learning system is based on data partitioning and parallel data mining by a loosely coupled collection of inductive algorithms. The system has been tested on an eight node Beowulf cluster and an IBM supercomputer comprised of 112 processors to discover new pharmacophores for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The system shows a linear speedup with the number of processor. A new potential ACE inhibitor pharmacophore with 5 active sites has been discovered during the testing of this parallel system.

J	Duntsch, I; Gediga, G				Duntsch, I; Gediga, G			Roughian: Rough information analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							SETS	Rough set data analysis (RSDA), introduced by Pawlak,(1) has become a much researched method of knowledge discovery with over 1200 publications to date.(2) One feature which distinguishes RSDA from other data analysis methods is that, in its original form, it gathers all its information from the given data, and does not make external model assumptions as all statistical and most machine learning methods (including decision tree procedures) do. The price which needs to be paid for the parsimony of this approach, however, is that some statistical backup is required, for example, to deal with random influences to which the observed data may be subjected. In supplementing RSDA by such meta-procedures care has to be taken that the same non-invasive principles are applied. In a sequence df papers and conference contributions, we have developed the components of a non-invasive method of data analysis, which is based on the RSDA principle, but is not restricted to "classical" RSDA applications. In this article, we present for the first time in a unified way the foundation and tools of such rough information analysis. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The process is time-consuming and I/O intensive. Several approaches are proposed to deal with that problem. however, concurrency is not often considered enough for high-performance data mining. In this paper, we propose a threads-based genetic algorithm for rule discovery, namely MT - RMGA. We evaluated it on the Nursery School public domain data set available from. the UCI Repository of Machine Learning databases. The results demonstrate that tire algorithm allows to discover high quality rules efficiently. Furthermore, a multi-threaded implementation allows to enhance the performance by a factor of over 14.5%.

But these systems have a limitation in that they are mainly based on the supervised learning which is not so adequate for learning problems with long-term goals and delayed rewards. This paper proposes a method of applying reinforcement learning, suitable for modeling and learning various kinds of interactions in real situations, to the problem of stock price prediction. The stock price prediction problem is considered as Markov process which can be optimized by reinforcement learning based algorithm. TD(0), a reinforcement learning algorithm which learns only from experiences, is adopted and function approximation by artificial neural network is performed to learn the values of states each of which corresponds to a stock price trend at a given time. An experimental result based on the Korean stock market is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

Our task is to find a small number of linguistic rules for approximately realizing nonlinear functions. In both approaches, the fitness value of each rule set is defined by the weighted sum of three criteria: the total squared error, the number of linguistic rules, and their total length. The length of each rule is defined by the number of antecedent conditions. One approach is rule selection where a small number of linguistic rules are selected from a large number of candidate rules by genetic algorithms. The other approach is fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (GBML) where each linguistic rule is coded as a symbolic substring by its antecedent and consequent linguistic values.

A case study	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						bioinformatics; machine learning; Inductive Logic Programming; cost function; grammatical inference	PROTEIN SORTING SIGNALS; PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; CLEAVAGE SITES; HUMAN GENOME; PREDICTION; CHALLENGE; PRECURSORS; ALIGNMENTS; DISCOVERY; PEPTIDES	This paper investigates whether Chomsky-like grammar representations are useful for learning cost-effective, comprehensible predictors of members of biological sequence families. The Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) Bayesian approach to learning from positive examples is used to generate a grammar for recognising a class of proteins known as human neuropeptide precursors (NPPs). Collectively, five of the co-authors of this paper, have extensive expertise on NPPs and general bioinformatics methods. Their motivation for generating a NPP grammar was that none of the existing bioinformatics methods could provide sufficient cost-savings during the search for new NPPs. Prior to this project experienced specialists at SmithKline Beecham had tried for many months to hand-code such a grammar but without success. Our best predictor makes the search for novel NPPs more than 100 times more efficient than randomly selecting proteins for synthesis and testing them for biological activity. As far as these authors are aware, this is both the first biological grammar learnt using ILP and the first real-world scientific application of the ILP Bayesian approach to learning from positive examples. A group of features is derived from this grammar. Other groups of features of NPPs are derived using other learning strategies. Amalgams of these groups are formed. A recognition model is generated for each amalgam using C4.5 and C4.5rules and its performance is measured using both predictive accuracy and a new cost function, Relative Advantage (RA). The highest RA was achieved by a model which includes grammar-derived features. This RA is significantly higher than the best RA achieved without the use of the grammar-derived features. Predictive accuracy is not a good measure of performance for this domain because it does not discriminate well between NPP recognition models: despite covering varying numbers of (the rare) positives, all the models are awarded a similar (high) score by predictive accuracy because they all exclude most of the abundant negatives.

The proposed approach consists of two phases: knowledge encoding and knowledge integrating. In the encoding phase, each knowledge input is translated and expressed as a rule set, and then encoded as a bit string. The combined bit strings form an initial knowledge population, which is then ready for integrating. In the knowledge integration phase, a genetic algorithm generates an optimal or nearly optimal rule set from these initial knowledge inputs. Furthermore, a rule-refinement scheme is proposed to refine inference rules via interaction with the environment. Experiments on diagnosing brain tumors were carried out to compare the accuracy of a rule set generated by the proposed approach with that of initial rule sets derived from different groups of experts or induced by means of various machine learning techniques. Results show that the rule set derived using the proposed approach is much more accurate than each initial rule set on its own.

J	Hunter, A				Hunter, A			A default logic based framework for context-dependent reasoning with lexical knowledge	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge representation; lexical knowledge; non-monotonic logic; default logic; reasoning under uncertainty	LANGUAGE; REPRESENTATION	Lexical knowledge is increasingly important in information systems-for example in indexing documents using keywords, or disambiguating words in a query to an information retrieval system, or a natural language interface. However, it is a difficult kind of knowledge to represent and reason with. Existing approaches to formalizing lexical knowledge have used languages with limited expressibility, such as those based on inheritance hierarchies, and in particular, they have not adequately addressed the context-dependent nature of lexical knowledge. Here we present a framework, based on default logic, called the dex framework, for capturing context-dependent reasoning with lexical knowledge. Default logic is a first-order logic offering a more expressive formalisation than inheritance hierarchies: (1) First-order formulae capturing lexical knowledge about words can be inferred; (2) Preferences over formulae can be based on specificity, reasoning about exceptions, or explicit priorities; (3) Information about contexts can be reasoned with as first-order formulae formulae; and (4) Information about contexts can be derived as default inferences. In the dex framework, a word for which lexical knowledge is sought is called a query word. The context for a query word is derived from further words, such as words in the same sentence as the query word. These further words are used with a form of decision tree called a context classification tree to identify which contexts hold for the query word. We show how we can use these contexts in default logic to identify lexical knowledge about the query word such as synonyms, antonyms, specializations, meronyms, and more sophisticated first-order semantic knowledge. We also show how we can use a standard machine learning algorithm to generate context classification trees.

J	Zhang, Z; Yang, Q				Zhang, Z; Yang, Q			Feature weight maintenance in case bases using introspective learning	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						case base maintenance and indexing; knowledge base indexing; dynamic index update through machine learning		A key issue in case-based reasoning is how to maintain the domain knowledge in the face of a changing environment. During the case retrieval process in case-based reasoning, feature-value pairs are used to compute the ranking scores of the cases in a case base, and different feature-value pairs may have different importance measures, represented as weight values, in this computation. How to maintain a set of appropriate feature weights so that they can be used to solve future problems effectively and efficiently will be a key factor in determining the success of case-based reasoning applications. Our focus in this paper is on the dynamic maintenance of feature weights in a case base. We address a particular problem related to the feature-weight maintenance issue. In current practice, the feature weights are assigned and revised manually, not only making them highly informal and inaccurate, but also involving intensive labor. We would like to introduce a semi-automatic introspective learning method to partially address this issue. Our approach is to construct a network architecture on the case base that supports introspective learning. Weight learning and weight-evolution are accomplished in the background through the integration of a learning network into case-based reasoning, in which, while the reasoning part is still case based, the learning part is shouldered by a layered network. The computation in the network follows well-known neural network algorithms with well known properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments.

J	Perkowski, MA; Jozwiak, L; Zhao, W				Perkowski, MA; Jozwiak, L; Zhao, W			Symbolic two-dimensional minimization of strongly unspecified finite state machines	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						minimization; finite state machines	ALGORITHMS	A generalization of the classical state minimization problem for finite state machine (FSM) is proposed and discussed. In contrast to classical state minimization algorithms that minimize in one dimension (states), our algorithm minimizes the FSM in two dimensions: the numbers of both input symbols and internal state symbols are minimized in an iterative sequence of input minimization and state minimization procedures. This approach leads to an input decomposition of the FSM. A modified formulation of the state minimization problem is also introduced, and an efficient branch-and-bound program, FMINI, is presented. FMINI produces an exact minimum result for each component minimization process and a globally quasi-minimum solution to the entire two-dimensional (2D) FSM minimization problem. For some benchmarks, especially those with a high percentage of don't cares, as those that occur in machine learning (ML), this approach produces a more optimum result than those produced by the state minimization alone.

Relations are represented by labeled rough partitions. structure similar to rough partitions introduced in [T. Luba, Decomposition of multiple-valued functions, in: Proceedings of the 25th ISMVL, 1995, pp. 256-261] but extended with labels to store the full information about relations. We present experimental results from comparison of our data structure to binary decision diagrams (BDDs) on binary functions (MCNC benchmarks) showing its superiority in terms of memory requirements in 73% cases. The new representation can be used to a large class of MV, completely and incompletely specified functions and relations, typical for machine learning and complex finite state machine (FSM) controller optimization applications.

Amer Med Informat Assoc			LANGUAGE	With the growing use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques as solutions in Medical Informatics, the need to quickly and efficiently create the knowledge structures used by these systems has grown concurrently. Automatic discovery of a lexicon for use by an NLP system through machine learning will require information about the syntax of medical language. Understanding the syntactic differences between medical and non-medical corpora may allow more efficient acquisition of a lexicon. Three experiments designed to quantify the syntactic differences in medical and non-medical corpora were conducted. The results show that the syntax of medical language shows less variation than non-medical language and is likely simpler. The differences were great enough to question the applicability of general language tools on medical language. These differences may reduce the difficulty of some free text machine learning problems by capitalizing on the simpler nature of narrative medical syntax.

Such attributes are often called features and success in solving a given problem can depend critically on the nature of the features selected to represent documents. Feature selection has received considerable attention in the machine learning literature. In the area of document retrieval we refer to feature selection as indexing. Indexing has not traditionally been evaluated by the same methods used in machine learning feature selection. Here we show how indexing quality may be evaluated in a machine learning setting and apply this methodology to results of the Indexing Initiative at the National Library of Medicine.

Amer Med Informat Assoc			NATURAL-LANGUAGE	At our institution, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool called MedLEE is used on a daily basis to parse medical texts including complete discharge summaries. MedLEE transforms written text into a generic structured format, which preserves the richness of the underlying natural language expressions by the use of concept modifiers (like change, certainty, degree and status). As a tradeoff, extraction of application-specific medical information is difficult without a clear understanding of how these modifiers combine. Me report on a knowledge model for MedLEE modifiers that is helpful for a high level interpretation of NLP data and is used for the generation of two distinct views on NLP-parsed discharge summaries: A 'physician view' offering a condensed overview of the severity of patient problems and a 'data mining view' featuring binary problem states useful for machine learning.

Although this model can obtain the high accuracy than a single SGNN, the computational cost increase in proportion to the number of SGNN in an ensemble. In this paper, we propose a new pruning SGNN algorithm to reduce the memory requirement for classification. We compared ESGNN with nearest neighbor classifier using a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. Experimental results show that our method could reduce the memory requirement and improve the accuracy over the nearest neighbor classifier's accuracy.

A genetic algorithm (GA) for the classification problem under an undetermined environment is proposed, which is based on a fuzzy distance function. The GA is to calculate the attribute weights and attach the attribute weights to modify the distance of similarity degrees. Furthermore, the attribute weights calculated by the proposed GA are applied to the discretized value difference metric (DVDM), and a new distance metric called weighted discretized value difference metric (WDVDM) is proposed. Computational experiments are conducted on benchmark problems, downloaded from UCl machine learning databases. Experimental results, compared with the C4.5 algorithms, show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and the WDVDM improves the discretized value difference metric (DVDM).

One of main features in financial investment problems is that the situation changes very often over time. In applying machine learning techniques under this circumstance, the authors have proved that additional learning plays an effective role, in particular, in financial problems by suggesting several techniques for additional learning using artificial neural networks. However, many practitioners claim that artificial neural networks are not transparent to explain why the result is obtained. In order to overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we consider the effect of additional learning using rule extraction methods. It will be shown that we can analyze the transition of importance of attributes over time by making additional learning in finacial investment problems.

In contrary to the common decision tree the vector decision tree can make more than just one suggestion per input sample. It has the functionality of many separate decision trees acting on a same set of training data and answering different questions. Vector decision tree is therefore simple in its form, is easy to use and analyse and can express some relationships between decisions not visible before. To explore and test the possibilities of this concept we developed a software tool - DecRain - for building vector decision trees using the ideas of evolutionary computing. Generated vector decision trees showed good results in comparison to classical decision trees. The concept of vector decision trees can be effectively used in any decision making process especially as computerised consulting systems. In the present paper we will present the application of vector decision trees in consulting about the style, cost range, colour etc. of young people which can be used in planing the clothing design and production.

J	Krott, A; Baayen, RH; Schreuder, R				Krott, A; Baayen, RH; Schreuder, R			Analogy in morphology: modeling the choice of linking morphemes in Dutch	LINGUISTICS			English	Article							LEARNING ALGORITHMS; GERMAN INFLECTION; WORDS; FREQUENCY; RULES	This study argues that a productive but not fully regular morphological phenomenon, the choice of linking morphemes in Dutch nominal compounds, is based on analogy. In Dutch, a linking -s- or -en- can appear between the constituents of a nominal compound. We present production experiments that reveal strong evidence that the choice of linking morphemes in novel compounds is analogically determined by the distribution of linking morphemes in what we call the "constituent families." A "constituent family'' is the set. of existing compounds that share the first (or second) constituent with the novel compound. A further experiment shows that in the case of derived pseudo-words as first constituents, it is the family of the suffix that influences the choice of the following linking morpheme. In addition to these experiments, we present computational simulation studies in which the choices made by participants in our experiments are predicted with a high degree of accuracy using a machine-learning algorithm for analogy. These studies support the status of the constituent family as the primary basis for analogical prediction. Finally, we outline a psycholinguistic model for analogy in the mental lexicon that does not give up symbolic representations and at the same time, captures nondeterministic variation.

No doubt speech-recognition rates will continue to improve and there will be increasing acceptance of this important channel of communication between human users and devices, from personal computers, PDA's. and private automobiles to kitchen ovens and refrigerators. Much of this communication will be successful, In Section 1, a detailed example from machine learning of robotic natural language will try to make clear why this is so. But the general reason is clear, Well-defined sublanguages of a natural language can be given a restricted and unambiguous semantic interpretation. Their semantic structure is close to that of an elementary formal language. In contrast, open-ended conversations, with the semantic ambiguities characteristic of such language use, present different and much more difficult problems. But progress on these problems will be critical for much wider use of speech in interacting with devices. In Section 2, some conjectures about how the brain handles such language are discussed, together with some detailed data on brain processing of language. Section 3, the final one, is devoted to considering whether device-implementation of conversational language is likely or not to use similar semantic computations.

We reinterpret this function in terms of the data variance explained by a clustering, or, equivalently, in terms of the square-error classical clustering criterion that administers the K-Means and Ward methods. This analysis suggests extensions of the scoring function to situations with differently standardized and mixed scale data.

J	Breiman, L				Breiman, L			Using iterated bagging to debias regressions	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						regression; bagging; out-of-bag; unbiased residuals	VARIANCE; BIAS	Breiman (Machine Learning, 26(2), 123-140) showed that bagging could effectively reduce the variance of regression predictors, while leaving the bias relatively unchanged. A new form of bagging we call iterated bagging is effective in reducing both bias and variance. The procedure works in stages-the first stage is bagging. Based on the outcomes of the first stage, the output values are altered; and a second stage of bagging is carried out using the altered output values. This is repeated until a simple rule stops the process. The method is tested using both trees and nearest neighbor regression methods. Accuracy on the Boston Housing data benchmark is comparable to the best of the results gotten using highly tuned and compute- intensive Support Vector Regression Machines. Some heuristic theory is given to clarify what is going on. Application to two-class classification data gives interesting results.

The method is useful especially in case of a multi-class problem or a noisy domain where unseen data are often not covered by the rules. Our method employs the Backpropagation Neural Network for the approximation. To build the network, we propose a technique for generating features from the rules to be used as inputs to the network. Our method has been evaluated on four domains of first-order learning problems. The experimental results show improvements of our method over the use of the original rules. We also applied our method to approximate match of propositional rules converted from an unpruned decision tree. In this case, our method can be thought of as soft-pruning of the decision tree. The results on multi-class learning domains in the UCI repository of machine learning databases show that our method performs better than standard C4.5's pruned and unpruned trees.

J	Hofmann, T				Hofmann, T			Unsupervised learning by probabilistic latent semantic analysis	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						unsupervised learning; latent class models; mixture models; dimension reduction; EM algorithm; information retrieval; natural language processing; language modeling	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; TEXT	This paper presents a novel statistical method for factor analysis of binary and count data which is closely related to a technique known as Latent Semantic Analysis. In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis.

Some prototypes of GIS have already been extended with a knowledge-base and some reasoning capabilities to support sophisticated map interpretation processes. Nevertheless, the acquisition of the necessary knowledge is still an open problem to which machine learning techniques can provide a solution. This paper presents an application of first-order rule induction to pattern recognition in topographic maps. Research issues related to the extraction of first-order logic descriptions from vectorized topographic maps are introduced. The recognition of morphological patterns in topographic maps of the Apulia region is presented as a case study.

The total amount of sensors is reduced by exhausting the information derived from the sensors far beyond the scope of traditional engineering through the application of various features and high-dimensional decision-making. The feature selection plays a crucial role in modelling an early fault detection system. Due to presence of noisy features with outliers and correlations between features a correctly determined subset of features will distinctly improve the classification rate. In addition the requirements for the hardware to monitor the pump decrease therefore its price. Wrappers and filters, the two major approaches for feature selection described in literature [4] will be investigated and compared using real-world data.

A new paradigm, Adaptive Boosting (AB), uses a markedly different theory in solutioning Computational Intelligence (CI) problems. AB, a new machine learning paradigm, focuses on finding weak learning algorithm(s) that initially need to provide slightly better than "random" performance (i.e., approximately 55%) when processing a mammogram training set. Then, by successive development of additional architectures (using the mammogram. training set), the adaptive boosting process improves the performance of the basic Evolutionary Programming derived neural network architectures. The results of these several EP-derived hybrid architectures are then intelligently combined and tested using a similar validation mammogram data set. Optimization focused on improving specificity and positive predictive value at very high sensitivities, where an analysis of the performance of the hybrid would be most meaningful. Using the DUKE mammogram. database of 500 biopsy proven samples, on average this hybrid was able to achieve (under statistical 5-fold cross-validation) a specificity of 48.3% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 51.8% while maintaining 100% sensitivity. At 97% sensitivity, a specificity of 56.6% and a PPV of 55.8% were obtained.	SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA	Land, WH (reprint author), SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.

The research has been performed with persons suffering from neuroticism or persons with risk type of behavior and persons having none of these symptoms. Classification has been done using an expert system. For classification using expert system we have developed two knowledge bases. The first one uses as input information reaction of physiological quantities. The total success rate of the expert system with this knowledge base is 60 per cent. Since the success rate of this knowledge base has not been high, we have developed another knowledge base using machine learning as an aid. The inputs are average values of physiological quantities, completed with anamnestic information. The total success rate of the expert system with this knowledge base is 81 per cent. These knowledge base have reached results in respondents' classification comparable to the results acquired by psychologists using psychological questionnaires.

We found that they are efficient methods, but the distribution of a learning set should be rather uniform. Also it is important that the number of learning cases is sufficient. If the two mentioned conditions are satisfied, these neural networks are similarly efficient as some other machine learning methods. The conditions are known in the theory of neural networks [1,2], but not often taken seriously in practice. Both networks functioned as well, excluding the case with several input variables, where the Kohonen neural networks surpassed the perceptron.

In contrary to the common decision tree the vector decision tree can make more than just one suggestion per input sample. It has the functionality of many separate decision trees acting on a same set of training data and answering different questions. Vector decision tree is therefore simple in its form, is easy to use and analyse and can express some relationships between decisions not visible before. To explore and test the possibilities of this concept we developed a software tool - DecRain - for building vector decision trees using the ideas of evolutionary computing. Generated vector decision trees showed good results in comparison to classical decision trees. The concept of vector decision trees can be safely and effectively used in any decision making process.

This paper investigates whether the logistic regression method can be considered as reference for validation of other methods. In order to test the stability of the predictions using this method, we performed two types of analyses on 50 random training and test samples drawn from the same database. In first analyses three models were obtained by forced entry of different sets of four variables. In second analyses, models were built with increasing number of predictive variables. The predictive performance was assessed by the area under the ROC curve. Although across-samples variability is low for a given model, it is large enough to lead to wrong conclusions when comparing different prediction methods. We also suggest that a low events-per-variable ratio alters the stability of a model's coefficients but does not affect the variability, of prediction performance.

This paper concentrates on the problem of separating acute appendicitis, which is a special problem of acute abdominal pain from other diseases that cause acute abdominal pain by use of an decision tree approach. Early and accurate diagnosing of acute appendicitis is still a difficult and challenging problem in everyday clinical routine. An important factor in the error rate is poor discrimination between acute appendicitis and other diseases that cause acute abdominal pain. This error rate is still high, despite considerable improvements in history-taking and clinical examination, computer-aided decision-support and special investigation, such as ultrasound We investigated three different large databases with cases of acute abdominal pain to complete this task as successful as possible. The results show that the size of the database does not necessary directly influence the success of the decision tree built on it. Surprisingly we got the best results from the decision trees built on the smallest and the biggest database, where the database with medium size (relative to the other two) was not so successful. Despite that we were able to produce decision tree classifiers that A-ere capable of producing correct decisions on test data sets with accuracy up to 84%, sensitivity to acute appendicitis up to 90%, and specificity up to 80% on the same test.

Methods: 19 parameters were determined from 131 lateral skull radiographs. Classifications were induced from raw data with simple visualisation, C5.0 and Kohonen feature maps; and using a Point Distribution Model (PDM) of shape templates comprising points taken from digitised radiographs. Results: The induced decision trees enable a direct of clinicians' idiosyncrosies in classification. Unsupervised algorithms induce models that are potentially more objective, but their blackbox nature makes them unsuitable for clinical application. The PDM methodology gives dramatic visualisations of two modes separating horizontal and vertical facial Kohonen feature maps favour one clinician and PDM the other. Clinical response suggests that while Clinician 1 places greater weight on 5 of 6 parameters, Clinician 2 relies on more parameters;that capture facial shape, Conclusions: While machine learning and statistical analyses classify subjects for vertical facial height they have limited application in their present form. The supervised learning algorithm C5.0 is effective for generating rules for individual clinicians but its inherent bias invalidates its use for objective classification of facial form for research purposes. On the otherhand, promising results from unsupervised strategies (especially the POW suggest a potential use for objective classification and further identification and analysis of ambiguous cases. At present, such methodologies may be unsuitable tor clinical application because of the invisibility of their underlying processes. Further study is required with additional patient data and a wider group of clinicians.

J	Pazzani, MJ; Mani, S; Shankle, WR				Pazzani, MJ; Mani, S; Shankle, WR			Acceptance of rules generated by machine learning among medical experts	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; mental retardation; artificial intelligence		Objectives: The aim was to evaluate the potential for monotonicity constraints to bias machine learning;systems to learn rules that were both accurate and meaningful. Methods: Two data sets, taken from problems as diverse as screening for dementia and assessing the risk of mental retardation, were collected and a rule learning system, with and without monotonicity constraints, was run on each. The rules were shown to-experts, who were asked how willing they would be to use such rules in practice, The accuracy of the rules was also evaluated. Results: Rules learned with monotonicity constraints Were at least as accurate as rules learned without such constraints. Experts were, on average, more willing to use the rules learned with the monotonicity constraints. Conclusions: The analysis of medical databases has the potential of improving patent outcomes and/or lowering the cost of health care delivery. Various techniques, from statistics, pattern recognition, machine learning, and neural networks, have been proposed to "mine" this data by uncovering patterns that may be used to guide decision making. This study :suggests cognitive factors make learned models coherent and, therefore, credible to experts. One factor that influences the acceptance of learned models is consistency with existing medical knowledge.

Methods. First, the medical problem is defined and. data for an observed population are collected; then a machine learning tool is used to generate hypotheses regarding the problem; finally, statistical methods are used to determine the validity of the generated hypotheses. Results: To illustrate this approach, the problem of defining indications for hip arthroplosty after an acute medial femoral neck fracture is investigated as a case study. Conclusions: The methodology is similar to the usual style of applying machine learning, but insists on a link to the techniques of statistical tests that are normally used in medicine. It aims at a more flexible and economical use of experimental data than in the usual medical research, which is enabled by techniques of machine learning. At the same time, by reference to traditional statistical tests, it is hoped that this approach will lead to improved acceptance of machine learning in the medical field.

For long time, Biologists gather these primary structures in large databases. Now, they focus on analyzing these primary, structures in order to extract useful knowledge. Data Mining approaches can be helpful to reach this goal, In this paper, we present a data mining approach based on Machine Learning techniques to do classification of biological sequences. B using our approach, we proceed within four steps : (i) During the first step, we construct the set of all the discriminant substrings, called Discriminant Descriptor (DD), associated with each family of primary structures, This construction is made thinks to an adaptation of the Karp, Miller and Rosenberg (KMR) algorithm. (ii) During the second step, we use the DDs constructed during the First step to code the families of primary structures by a table of examples versus attributes, called context. (iii) During the third step, we extract knowledge from the context constructed during the second step and represent it by production rules.

These can be difficult to train and they require tremendous computational resources. In this paper, we investigate the simple dual perceptron, with both polynomial and p-norm kernels of differing degrees. Even such a simple strategy can achieve a relatively low error rate of 11.4% after only a few epochs, when combined with a method for choosing the best hypothesis generated during the training phase. By using an un-weighted average of all the hypotheses, the average percentage of False Negatives can be reduced to 0.4%, but at the cost of an increase in the number of mistakes. Missing a splice site can make it impossible to understand the structure or function of the genes in the DNA so such an unweighted average is still highly desirable, especially considering its simplicity.

People were tested using CT, MRI and also EEG. The above-mentioned tests were used for a priori patients' diagnosis information. People, having epilepsy, also had some visual perception abnormalities. Epileptic persons were tested using special computerized size form discrimination test. Special machine learning (ML) techniques were used for testing data processing and creation of regularities. In parallel, special auto-regressive (AR) methods were used as well. It could be stated that special ML techniques worked better than AR methods 70 percent of tested persons were classified correctly by Using ML in comparison with AR methods (where only 30 persons were classified correctly). ML analysis could be used in preliminary epilepsy diagnosis for the patients having unknown brain damage. Our machine learning subsystem was capable of extracting interesting dependencies that related VP test results to person's diagnosis. Even if induced rules show near perfect accuracy on the learning set examples additional data and experiences are required for being able to conclude that machine generated rule sets ate appropriate for computer aided diagnosing based on VP test. We have realized, that it is useful to combine both visual perception testing data and EEG processing methods. CHARADE and LPC gave the best classification results. The sensitivity for the classified data was about 89 percent. Only 11 percent of given samples were misclassified. The results show, that visual perception factor (size and discrimination) could be used for early epilepsy detection stage.

More precisely, we have obtained diagnosis models that discriminate between Cerebellum Pontine Angle (CPA) tumors and Otorhinolaryngological (ENT) disorders and compared them according to: accuracy, false negative minimization, and the interpretability of the model. These models are generated by means of five different learning methods: Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, C4.5, CART, and OneR. In order to differentiate CPA tumors from other disorders one must Perform a clinical-neuro logical examination together with expensive radiological imagery (CT and MRI) and/or invasive exams. This comparison shows how to obtain useful diagnostic models based only on clinical data, without the need of such expensive complementary exams.

Many algorithms and their modifications, derived from stripping ratio concepts, displacement of conic volumes, dynamic programming and graph theory have been developed to design and optimize pit layouts. These algorithms have assisted engineers in making decisions on mine design and optimization but they are limited in dealing with the stochastic nature of pit design and optimization. Large data acquisition requirements and the need for complete rerun of these algorithms when information and data changes result in long computation and CPU times. Current algorithms do not provide analysts with intelligent design options to deal with structural, hydrology and tectonics problems of mine design, In this paper, the authors lay the foundation for the development of a 3-D intelligent pit design and optimization algorithm for solving these problems. Machine learning algorithms (adaptive logic network) facilitate the modeling of complex systems, networks and physical phenomena that do not lend themselves to accurate classical mathematical analysis. Machine learning algorithms also use linear pieces for approximating functions which is very convenient for modeling the slopes of the ultimate pit configuration and can be made to maximize the NPV of an open pit of the ultimate pit. This gives mine operators a truly optimized open pit which takes into consideration random field properties of the parameters involved in mine design and optimization.

The advantages of this method are 1) it accepts both categorical and continuous data at the same time, and 2) rules can be extracted easily from the generated model. We applied GMDH Algorithm to categorical data set of US congress voting records to extract rules. The correction rate of GMDH rules was 97.3% - higher than Tsukimoto's method of rule extraction from BProp NN (81.0%). It was also higher than 97.0% of C4.5.

We focus on multi-agent systems for integration of already existing software components. It is supposed that all the social knowledge is kept separated from both the problem solving knowledge and agents' specific internal intelligence and that it is organized and administered in the acquaintance models located in the agents' wrappers. A specific tri-base acquaintance model (3bA) is formalized and discussed throughout the paper. This model helps to optimize the communication traffic, to implement meta-reasoning processes and supports the machine learning activities. Several practical applications of the 3bA acquaintance model in different fields are presented and the acquired experience is discussed.

Rather than presenting a complete literature review, we focus in this paper on important issues surrounding the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). In this discussion we move from disembodied ML over single-agent learning to full multiagent learning. In the second part of the paper we focus on the application of Inductive Logic Programming, a knowledge-based ML technique, to MAS, and present an implemented framework in which multi-agent learning experiments can be carried out.

Special emphasis is laid on how the ANN can advance CBR technology by building an ANN-based CBR system, or integrating itself as a component within a CBR system. Several ANN models proposed for constructing a CBR system and for solving some special issues involved in a CBR process are described. The main characteristics of each model are analysed, and the advantages and limitations of different models are compared. Also, future research directions are outlined.

Minnowmatch (Mima) automatically determines various meta-data and makes classifications concerning a piece of audio using neural networks and support vector machines. The technologies developed in Minnowmatch may be used to create audio information retrieval systems, copyright protection devices, and recommendation agents. This paper concentrates on the artist or source detection component of Mima, which we show to classify a one-in-n artist space correctly 91% over a small song-set and 70% over a larger song set. We show that scaling problems using only neural networks for classification can be addressed with a pre-classification step of multiple support vector machines.

Underestimates lead to time pressures that may compromise full functional development and thorough testing of the software product. On the other hand, overestimates can result in over allocation of development resources and personnel [1]. Many models for effort estimation have been developed during the past years; some of them use parametric methods with some degree of success, other kind of methods belonging to the machine learning techniques, such as Neural Networks (NN), have been also studied in this field showing more accurate estimations, and finally the Genetic programming (GP) techniques are being considered as promising tools for the prediction of effort estimation. In this work we are to compare the behaviour of GP and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to the Neural Network approach (backpropagation).

Effective solutions to this problem are indispensable especially when dealing with MRI of dynamic phenomena since then, rapid sampling in k-space is required. The goal in such a case is to reduce the measurement time by omitting as many scanning trajectories as possible. This approach, however, entails underdetermined equations and leads to poor image reconstruction. It is proposed here that significant improvements could be achieved concerning image reconstruction if a procedure, based on machine learning, for estimating the missing samples of complex k-space were introduced. To this end, the viability of involving supervised and unsupervised neural network algorithms for such a problem is considered and it is found that their image reconstruction results are very favorably compared to the ones obtained by the trivial zero-tilled k-space approach or traditional more sophisticated interpolation approaches.

This data set was created by image feature extraction procedures working on digitized X-ray films. We introduce a framework for distinguishing classification methods. We found that more detailed analysis of the error rate is necessary in order to judge the performance of the learning and classification method. However, the error rate cannot be the only criterion for comparing between the different learning methods. This is a more complex selection process that involves more criteria that we are describing in this paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dibike, YB; Solomatine, DP				Dibike, YB; Solomatine, DP			River flow forecasting using artificial neural networks	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH PART B-HYDROLOGY OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE			English	Article								River flow forecasting is required to provide basic information-on a wide range of problems related to the design and operation of river systems. The availability of extended records of rainfall and other climatic data, which could be used to obtain stream flow data, initiated the practice of rainfall-runoff modelling. While conceptual or physically-based models are of importance in the understanding of hydrological processes, there are many practical situations where the main concern is with making accurate predictions at specific locations. In such situation it is preferred to implement a simple "black box" (data-driven, or machine learning) model to identify a direct mapping between the inputs and outputs without detailed consideration of the internal structure of the physical process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) is probably the most successful machine learning technique with flexible mathematical structure which is capable of identifying complex non-linear relationships between input and output data without attempting to reach understanding as to the nature of the phenomena. In this study the applicability of ANNs for downstream flow forecasting in the Apure river basin (Venezuela) was investigated. Two types of ANN architectures, namely multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and a radial basis function network (RBF) were implemented. The performances of these networks were compared with a conceptual rainfall-runoff model and they were found to be slightly better for this river flow-forecasting problem.

This paper investigates the application of a relatively new machine learning technique, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) together with a preprocessing algorithm based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) in the Singapore rainfall prediction. Whereas SSA decomposes original time series into a set of high frequency and low frequency components, SVM helps in efficiently dealing with the computational and generalization performance in a high-dimensional input space. Pre-processing of the raw data with SSA significantly improved the prediction results. The I-lead day prediction gave correlation coefficient as high as 0.82 for training and 0.71 for verification.

Although we could learn classification rules inductively by means of decision tree generation, we wonder whether it; is consistent with our utilization or not. In this investigation we discuss how to obtain assessment of learning results by verifying belief. Our idea is based on Decision Tree with Hierarchy to class and attributes; to each attribute we assume taxonomy on the domain in addition to class hierarchy. Then, given a firm belief (such as regulation and top executive policy), we check whether the trees.

The task is answering factual questions, where the answers. axe to be found in documents in a large text database. We trained our system on 398 questions from the Remedia corpus, as well as 138 TREC-8 development questions. We then evaluated our system on 198 questions of the TREC-8 question answering task. Although our learning approach only uses 4 features, we are able to achieve quite competitive accuracy. The results indicate that such a machine learning approach is a promising way to build a state-of-the-art question answering system.

We find that a very simple approach using a machine learning algorithm and a domain-specific lexical hierarchy successfully generalizes from training instances, performing better on previously unseen words than a baseline consisting of training on the words themselves.

An ecosystem model composed of insects and plants, which are in a relationship of parasitism, is simulated on the discrete cell space. In this ecosystem, the plants become easy to be eliminated as the population size of the insects increases. Consequently, it is required to maintain numerical balance of plants and insects in the quasi -ecosystem. Therefore, multiple robots are introduced to remove some insects from the quasi -ecosystem. However, if the robots eliminate all of insects, the viruses will eliminate the plants owing to diseases. In this ecosystem with complicated relationship, the ro bo ts should acquire strategies to maintain plants. In this paper, we use simple if-then rules and apply genetics-based machine learning for acquiring a strategy for removing insects. Furthermore, we show several simulation results of behavior learning of multiple robots.

Using DTs, we can extract comprehensible decision rules, and make decisions based only on useful features. The drawback is that, once a DT is designed, there is no free parameter for further development. On the contrary, a neural network (NN) is adaptable or learnable, but the number of free parameters is usually too large to be determined efficiently. To have the advantages of both approaches, it is important to combine them together. Among many ways for combining NNs and DTs, this paper introduces a neural network tree (NNTree). An NNTree is a decision tree with each node being an expert neural network (ENN). The overall tree structure can be designed by following the same procedure as used in designing a conventional DT. Each node (an ENN) can be designed using genetic algorithms (GAs). Thus, the NNTree also provides a way for integrating DT, NN and GA. Through experiments with a digit recognition problem we show that NNTrees are more efficient than traditional DTs in the sense that higher recognition rate can be achieved with less nodes. Further more, if the fitness function for each node is defined properly, better generalization ability can also be achieved.

Linguistic rules are extracted from numerical input-output data by a multi-objective fuzzy GBML (genetics-based machine learning) algorithm. In this paper, we first formulate our rule extraction task as a three-objective combinatorial optimization problem. Three objectives are to minimize the total squared error, the number of linguistic rules, and their total length. Then we show how a fuzzy GBML algorithm can be implemented in the framework of multi-objective optimization. This algorithm does not try to find a single rule set but a number of non-dominated rule sets with respect to the three objectives. Finally we illustrate our approach to linguistic modeling through computer simulations on numerical examples.

Our CGA consists of two GA populations: the first GA (H-GA) searches for the solutions in the given problems and the second GA (P-GA) searches for effective schemata of the H-GA. We aim to improve the search ability of our CGA by extracting more efficiently useful schemata from the H-GA population, and then incorporating those extracted schemata in natural manner into the P-GA. Several computational simulations on multidimensional knapsack problems confirm us the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Specifically, we focus on one significant component of a complete AIS, static clonal selection with a negative selection operator, describing this system in detail. Three different data sets from the UCI repository for machine learning are used in the experiments. Two important factors, the detector sample size and the antigen sample size, are investigated in order to generate an appropriate mixture of general and specific detectors for learning non-self antigen patterns. The results of series of experiments suggest how to choose appropriate detector and antigen sample sizes. These ideal sizes allow the AIS to achieve a good non-self antigen detection rate with a very low rate of self antigen detection. We conclude that the embedded negative selection operator plays an important role in the AIS by helping it to maintain a low false positive detection rate.

The main dealing of it includes complex system behavior of multiple autonomous agents. Because of the complexity of system, how to describe cooperation and competition between agents becomes a great challenge in RoboCup Simulation Game. On one hand, the rich experience of human soccer player is of great service to the robot players. On the other hand, the difference between simulation game and real game make it a must to fit the transcendental knowledge into the new environment. Commonly used reinforcement learning is weak in utilizing transcendental knowledge, thus is limited in complex Multi-agent System (MAS) learning problems. This thesis puts forward a supervised learning method on the basis of Adapted Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to mapping the competition among the robots. This method can build an ANFIS according to experts' knowledge, and with data obtained in the simulation environment; it is able to adjust parameters of the system's antecedents and consequents in a self-adapt way. So it can establish a correct map to describe the competition among the robots. We use this method to describe the antagonization between the shooter and goalie, and successfully apply it in the RoboCup Simulation Game to build the champion team in RoboCup 2000 of China.

This research follows the neurorehabilitation studies indicating that the provision of life-like reaching and grasping in stroke subjects is essential for their faster and more effective recovery. The designed 16-channel neuroprosthesis delivers charge-balanced impulses, and controls the pulse width, frequency and stimulus intensity on each channel independently. The main novelty is a controller that supports sensory driven, rule-based control. The rules use sensory information and mappings that can be determined by machine learning. The controller supports up to eight analog sensors, six digital sensors, five timers, and comprises a flash memory for handling time series. An interface for downloading programs from a PC computer was realized via a serial communication channel by means of an infrared link.

In our method, first characteristics of EEG, EOG and EMG are compared with characteristic features of alpha waves, delta waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes and REMs. Then, several parameters that are necessary for sleep stage scoring are extracted. We transform these extracted parameters into a few discrete variables using canonical discriminant analysis and the discretization method based on a random walk, and then a committee that consists of several small decision trees is formed from a small number of training instances. Furthermore final sleep stages are decided by a majority decision of the committee. Our method was applied to the digitized PSG chart data, provided by the Japan Society of Sleep Research and we carried out an evaluation experiment. The experiment indicated that our method can quickly execute learning and classification and precisely score sleep stages.

Foremost among these challenges is the need to ensure data integrity and quality, by automatically or semi-automatically identifying unreliable or hostile contributors and rejecting their contributed data. Other, traditional requirements include security, scalability, and the need to support collaboration between separate but related data collection projects. Further, for the open software/data model, the system must permit users to freely browse, navigate and download the contributed data. This pa-per presents a collaborative architecture for a set of such data collection projects that addresses these challenges and requirements. Key components of this architecture have been implemented and tested as part of the Open blind Initiative.

Such models use an undirected graph to capture dependency information among random variables in a joint probability distribution. Once one has chosen to use a Markov network model, one aims to choose the model that "best explains" the data that has been observed-this model can then be used to make predictions about future data. We show that the problem of learning a maximum likelihood Markov network given certain observed data can be reduced to the problem of identifying a maximum weight low-treewidth graph under a given input weight function. We give the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem. More precisely, for any fixed treewidth objective k, we find a treewidth-k graph with an f (k) fraction of the maximum possible weight of any treewidth-k graph.

The input to the system is a free-text report from a radiologic study. The system requires no reporting style changes on the part of the radiologist. Statistical and machine learning methods are used extensively throughout the system. A graphical user interface has been developed that allows the creation of hand-tagged training examples. Various aspects of the difficult problem of implementing an automated structured reporting system have been addressed, and the relevant technology is progressing well. Extensible Markup Language is emerging as the preferred syntactic standard for representing and distributing these structured reports within a clinical environment. Early successes hold out hope that similar statistically based models of language will allow deep understanding of textual reports. The success of these statistical methods will depend on the availability of large numbers of high-quality training examples for each radiologic subdomain. The acceptability of automated structured reporting systems will ultimately depend on the results of comprehensive evaluations.

The work presented here builds upon previous work on artificial immune systems for data analysis. A population control mechanism, inspired by the natural immune system, has been introduced to control population growth and allow termination of the learning algorithm. The new algorithm is presented, along with the immunological metaphors used as inspiration. Results are presented for Fisher Iris data set, where very successful results are obtained in identifying clusters within the data set. It is argued that this new resource based mechanism is a large step forward in making artificial immune systems a viable contender for effective unsupervised machine learning and allows for not just a one shot learning mechanism, but a continual learning model to be developed.

Recent research has shown that classification performance can be significantly improved by voting predictions of multiple, independently produced decision trees. This paper describes an algorithm, OB1, that produces a weighted sum over many possible models. Model weights are determined by the prior probability of the model, as well as the performance of the model during training. We describe an implementation of OB1 that includes all possible decision trees as well as naive Bayesian models within a single option tree. Constructing all possible decision trees is very expensive? growing exponentially in the number of attributes. However it is possible to use the internal structure of the option tree to avoid recomputing values. In addition, the current implementation allows the option tree to be depth bounded. OB1 is compared with a number of other decision tree and instance based learning algorithms using a selection of data sets from the UCI repository and a maximum option tree depth of three attributes. Both information gain and percentage correct are used for the comparison. For the information gain measure OB1 performs significantly better than the other algorithms. When using percentage correct OB1 is significantly better than all the algorithms except naive Bayes and boosted C5.0(1), which perform slightly worse than OB1.

The key step in the process of inferring decision trees is finding the right criteria for splitting the training set into smaller and smaller subsets so that, ideally, all elements of a subset finally belong to one class. These split criteria can be defined in different ways (e.g. minimizing impurity of a subset, or minimizing entropy in a subset), and therefore they emphasize different properties of the inferred tree, such as size or classification accuracy. In this paper we analyze if the split functions introduced in a statistical and machine learning context are also well suited for a KDD context. We selected two well known split functions, namely Gini Index (CART) and Information Gain (C4.5) and introduced our own family of split functions and tested them on 9,000 data sets of different sizes (from 200 to 20, 000 tuples). The tests have shown that the two popular functions are very sensitive to the variation of the training set sizes and therefore the quality of the inferred trees is highly dependent on the training set size. At the same time however, we were able to show that the simplest members of the introduced family of split functions behave in a very predictable way and, furthermore, the created trees were superior to the trees inferred using the Gini Index or the Information Gain based on our evaluation criteria.

Three methods explored are decision trees, genetic algorithms and neural networks. By using such a machine learning method, the decision-making program is trained with a representative training set of cases and tested with another set. The machine learning methods are useful also for our otoneurological expert system, One, which is based on a pattern recognition approach. The methods are able to differentiate most of the cases tested between the six diseases included, provided that a sufficiently large training set is available.

This system was applied to discover diagnostic rules from a patient database containing 563 cases with vestibular schwannoma, bening paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, sudden deafness, traumatic vertigo and vestibular neuritis diagnoses. The rules were evaluated using an independent testing set. The accuracy of rules for these diagnoses were 91%, 96%, 81%, 95%, 92% and 98%, respectively. Besides being accurate, the rules contained the five most important diagnostic questions identified in the earlier research. The knowledge presented with rules can be easily comprehended and verified.

Numerous decision trees were constructed to examine relationships between oculomotor test parameters and lesion sites in a data set containing cases with operated cerebello-pontifie angle tumour, operated hemangioblastoma, infarction of cerebello-brainstem and Meniere's disease, and control subjects. The aim was to find useful parameter combinations with discriminatory power. Decision trees constructed using both pursuit eye movements and saccadic eye movements yielded the best classification results. This is reasonable: oculomotor test results vary according to the site of the lesion and so the performance ability of subjects has to be taken into account in the classification. The decision tree program was able to generate classification models from the oculomotor data set. Generated decision trees were intelligible and can be utilized in physicians' research work.

The data bases are useful tools to render help to technicians working with laser machines. But it is only the first step in utilization of intelligent computer programs. In this paper we present the results of the development of expert system (ES) to help technicians in the choice of best conditions for laser processing of materials. The ES has been created on the basis of practical knowledge of experts and experimental results collected to the data base. The set of parameters was developed for the description of laser technological processes. Each of the processes was characterized by the values of such parameters changing in some reasonable diapasons. Those parameters were divided into input and output groups. The input group of parameters included the main technical characteristics of the laser, the type of the material and the demands on the quality of laser processing products. The output group of parameters consisted of the set of laser processing conditions recommended by the expert system. Generally, the ES presents a computer model of the expert's decision making process. The steps of such a process are a new task analysis, search of closest past cases, evaluation of tasks similarity and so on. The expert system called MALS (Machine Learning Shell) is presented in this paper as an example of ES which could give consultations on the best choice of the laser cutting process.

This is a multi-layer incremental induction algorithm, which is linked to an existing non-incremental induction algorithm to learn incrementally from noisy data. This method is applied to the learning problem under the conditions that 1) the data set is very large, 2) data quality is low, 3) after partition, each subset still meets the requirements of data completeness and information integrity. These conditions would guarantee that learning reliability will not be affected by such data partitioning The method mainly comprises three processing steps, which Arbiter applies to the data set, rule generalization, and reduction of data subsets. The experimental results show that by applying the Arbiter learning from partitioned data in a large scale data set, we are able to sustain the accuracy level of a single classifier trained on the entire data set, and improve some existing non-incremental learning algorithms.

Multiple transversals naturally arise in 0-1 programming, while partial transversals are related to data mining and machine learning. We show that for an arbitrary hypergraph the families of multiple and partial transversals are both dual-bounded in the sense that the size of the corresponding dual hypergraph is bounded by a polynomial in the cardinality and the length of description of the input hypergraph. Our bounds are based on new inequalities of extremal set theory and threshold Boolean logic, which may be of independent interest. We also show that the problems of generating all multiple and all partial transversals for a given hypergraph are polynomial-time reducible to the generation of all ordinary transversals for another hypergraph, i.e., to the well-known dualization problem for hypergraphs. As a corollary, we obtain incremental quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for both of the above problems, as well as for the generation of all the minimal binary solutions for an arbitrary monotone system of linear inequalities.

Handwriting samples of 1,500 individuals, representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, ethnic groups, etc., were obtained. Analyzing differences in handwriting was done by using computer algorithms for extracting features froth scanned images of handwriting. Attributes characteristic of the handwriting were obtained, e.g., line separation, slant, character shapes, etc. These attributes, which are a subset of attributes used by expert document examiners. were used to quantitatively, establish individuality by using machine learning approaches. Using global attributes of handwriting and yen, few characters in the writing, the ability to determine the writer with a high degree of confidence Was established. The work is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting handwriting evidence in court. The mathematical approach curd the resulting software also have the promise of aiding the expert document examiner.

The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of hand-printed Arabic characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over the large degree of variation between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example. The system was tested on a sample of handwritten characters from several individuals whose writing ranged from acceptable to poor in quality and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 86.65%.

Handwriting samples of one thousand five hundred individuals, representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, ethnic groups, etc., were obtained. Analyzing differences in handwriting was done by using computer algorithms for extracting features from scanned images of handwriting. Attributes characteristic of the handwriting were obtained, e.g., line separation, slant, character shapes, etc. These attributes, which are a subset of attributes used by expert document examiners, were used to quantitatively establish individuality by using machine learning approaches. Using global attributes of hadwriting and very, few characters in the writing, the ability to determine the writer with a high degree of confidence was established. The work is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting handwriting evidence in court. The mathematical approach and the resulting software also have the promise of aiding the expert document examiner.

Application to digit image recognition.	SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)	SEP 10-13, 2001	SEATTLE, WA	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit				A new direction in machine learning area has emerged from Vapnik's theory in support vectors machine and its applications on pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new SVM kernel family (KMOD) with distinctive properties that allots, better discrimination in the feature space. The experiments that we carry out show its effectiveness on synthetic and large-scale data. We found KMOD behaving better than RBF and Exponential RBF kernels on the two-spiral problem. In addition, a digit recognition task was processed using the proposed kernel. The results show; at least, comparable performances to state of the art kernels.

Different parameters were collected simultaneously when embeded sensors (dielectric, optical fiber, and piezoelectric sensors) were used within two different composite matrices during the curing process. The measurements were used by an algorithm software as a logged data file, resulting in to inducing a decision tree. Later, a systematic software is designed based on the rules derived from this decision tree, to recognise the type of composites used in the experiment together with recognition of their physical and mechanical characteristics. This is a new approach to data acquisition in intelligent materials produced by smart manufacturing system.

The paradigm, Adaptive Boosting (AB), uses a markedly different theory in solving Computational Intelligence (CI) problems. AB, a new machine learning paradigm, focuses on finding weak learning algorithm(s) that initially need to provide slightly better than "random" performance (i.e., approximately 55%) when processing a mammogram. training set By successive development of additional architectures (using the mammogram training set), the adaptive boosting process improves performance of the basic Evolutionary Programming derived neural network architectures. The results of these several EP-derived hybrid architectures are then intelligently combined and tested using a similar validation mammogram data set. Optimization, focused on improving specificity and positive predictive value at very high sensitivities, with an analysis of the performance of the hybrid would be most meaningful. Using the DUKE mammogram database of 500 biopsy proven samples, this hybrid, on average, was able to achieve (under statistical 5-fold cross-validation) a specificity of 48.3 % and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 51.8 % while maintaining 100% sensitivity. At 97% sensitivity, a specificity of 56.6% and a PPV of 55.8% were obtained.	SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA	Land, WH (reprint author), SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.

J	Syrdal, AK; Hirschberg, J; McGory, J; Beckman, M				Syrdal, AK; Hirschberg, J; McGory, J; Beckman, M			Automatic ToBI prediction and alignment to speed manual labeling of prosody	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article							TEXT	Tagging of corpora for useful linguistic categories can be a time-consuming process, especially with linguistic categories for which annotation standards are relatively new, such as discourse segment boundaries or the intonational events marked in the Tones and Break Indices (ToBI) system for American English. A ToBI prosodic labeling of speech typically takes even experienced labelers from 100 to 200 times real time. An experiment was conducted to determine (1) whether manual correction of automatically assigned ToBI labels would speed labeling, and (2) whether default labels introduced any bias in label assignment. A large speech corpus of one female speaker reading several types of texts was automatically assigned default labels. Default accent placement and phrase boundary location were predicted from text using machine learning techniques. The most common ToBI labels were assigned to these locations for default tones and break type. Predicted pitch accents were automatically aligned to the mid-point of the word, while breaks and edge tones were aligned to the end of the phrase-final word. The corpus was then labeled by a group of five trained transcribers working over a period of nine months. Half of each set of recordings was labeled in the standard fashion without default labels, and the other half was presented with preassigned default labels for labelers to correct. Results indicate that labeling from defaults was generally faster than standard labeling, and that defaults had relatively little impact on label assignment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Reliable dissolve detection, however, is still an unsolved problem. In this paper we present the first robust and reliable dissolve detection system. A detection rate of 69% was achieved while reducing the false alarm rate to an acceptable level of 68% on a test video set for which so far the best reported detection and false alarm rare had been 57% and 185%, respectively! In addition, the temporal extent of the dissolves are estimated by a multi-resolution detection approach. The three core ideas of our novel approach are firstly the creation of a dissolve synthesizer capable of creating in principle an infinite number of dissolve examples of any duration from a video database of raw video footage, secondly two new features for capturing the characteristics of dissolves, and thirdly, the exploitation of machine learning ideas for reliable object detection such as the bootstrap-method to improve the set of non-dissolve examples and the search at multiple resolutions as well as the usage of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, support-vector machines and linear vector quantizer.

The idea is that a proof planner would be capable of learning new proof methods from well chosen examples of proofs which use a similar reasoning strategy to prove related theorems, and this strategy could be characterised as a proof method. We propose a representation framework- for methods, and a machine learning technique which can learn methods using this representation framework. The technique can be applied (amongst other) to learn whether and when to call external systems such as theorem provers or computer algebra systems.

J	Cox, LA				Cox, LA			Forecasting demand for telecommunications products from cross-sectional data	TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th INFORMS Telecommunications Conference	MAR, 1998	BOCA RATON, FLORIDA			classification tree forecasting; continuous simulation; dynamic systems model; machine learning	SELECTION; MODEL	A crucial planning problem for many telecommunications companies is how best to forecast changes in demand for their products over the next several years. This paper presents a new approach to demand forecasting that performs well compared to even sophisticated time series methods but that re quires far less data. It is based on the following simple idea: Divide units of analysis (census blocks, customers, etc.) into groups with relatively homogeneous behaviors, forecast the behavior of each group (which can be done easily, by construction), and sum over all groups to obtain aggregate forecasts. Identifying groupings of customers to minimize forecast errors is a difficult combinatorial challenge that we address via the data-mining technique of classification tree analysis. Product acquisition rates are modeled as transition rates in a multi-state simulation model. The dynamic simulation model is used to integrate the transition rate and covariate information and to predict the resulting changes in product demands over time.

We first consider probability densities over binary strings and we define two different statistical criteria. Then we recast the initial problem as the problem of finding a density minimizing one of the two criteria. We restrict ourselves to densities described by a small number of parameters and solve the new problem by means of gradient techniques. This results in stochastic algorithms which iteratively update density parameters. We apply these algorithms to two families of densities, the Bernoulli model and the Gaussian model. The algorithms have been implemented and some experiments are reported.

Reactive execution is often used in order to provide best decisions for the agent's reactions. Although this problem is important in the stationary environment, most interesting environments are time varying. This paper is based on our previous work focusing on combining the potential field model with reinforcement learning to solve the stationary path planning problem. In this work we deal with the case of dynamic environment. In the dynamic environment, the motion of the obstacles provides for different problems and challenges, which our proposed algorithm in this paper encounters and addresses.

However, often these 'actions' have additional features. In this paper we combine an algorithm to detect frequent subsequences with an inductive logic programming system to automatically generate for each frequent subsequence the most specific 'template' for these additional features that is consistent with the observed frequent subsequences. The resulting system is implemented and used in an application where we automatically generate macros from logs of the use of a Unix command shell.

Observations of the user's behavior can provide training examples that a machine learning system can use to form a model designed to predict future actions. However, user modeling poses a number of challenges for machine learning that have hindered its application in user modeling, including: the need for large data sets; the need for labeled data; concept drift; and computational complexity. This paper examines each of these issues and reviews approaches to resolving them.

Our task is to extract a small number of comprehensible linguistic rules from numerical data for describing nonlinear functions in a human understandable manner. First we show the necessity of general rules in the handling of nonlinear functions with many input variables. Next we compare a standard interpolation-based fuzzy reasoning method with our non-standard specificity-based method. When a rule base Is a mixture of general and specific rules, different results are obtained from these two methods. Then we extend two performance measures i.e., confidence and support) of association rules in data mining to the case of linguistic rules. These two measures are used for evaluating each linguistic rule. The validity of our fuzzy reasoning method is discussed using these measures. Finally we show two genetic algorithm-based approaches to linguistic modeling. One Is a rule selection method, and the other Is a genetics-based machine learning (GBML) algorithm.

We show that object-oriented modelling with words has two key benefits; firstly the uncertain class hierarchy provides a natural knowledge representstion framework for real-world problems, and secondly the object-oriented paradigm enforces a strict software engineering design and implementation process. In this paper we present a new approach to object-oriented modelling with words based on a new theory of inheritance where object memberships and property applicabilities are uncertain. We present the uncertain object-oriented logic programming language Fril++ as a tool for object-oriented modelling with words. We present an example application of object-oriented modelling with words; an extendible object-oriented data browser and machine learning environment.

The following paper examines the scalability of fuzzy systems to a large-scale problem that is inherently vague, that of text categorization. The paper presents two fuzzy probabilistic approaches to text classification and corresponding machine learning algorithms to learn such systems from example data. The first approach follows the traditional fuzzy set paradigm, while the second approach fits within the modeling with words paradigm using granule features to represent the text problem domain.

This may not be appropriate for dynamic systems, especially where higher-order information is unavailable. This paper proposes a novel approach to reasoning about dynamic systems drawing upon the first-order approach to temporal logic. A brief overview of the classical theory is provided and extended to a fuzzy theory modelling the inherent vagueness of linguistic terms such as "recently". The notion of a temporal qualification is developed as a domain independent method for augmenting base domains and term set of a linguistic variable. Such extended variables are termed temporal linguistic variables. The technique is then applied to a simple dynamic system highlighting its advantage over traditional approaches. Since temporal linguistic variables are a special case of linguistic variable they are immediately applicable in fuzzy knowledge based system and machine learning contexts.

Our discussion in this paper concentrates on the MEME system that supports information-sharing communities. Within the messaging system each community or individual users are represented as virtual characters or avatars that react to the semantics and other features of the content being shared. Our goal is to develop models guiding the behavior of virtual characters that express such features of information as semantic relevance, timeliness or even intentions of system users. Machine learning techniques are applied to generate models of information and to control the behavior of virtual characters that populate the system.

These ALS systems need complex control strategies that can maintain stable system performance and balance resources with small margins and minimal buffers. In this paper we will describe the ALS control task in detail and give some examples of previous control solutions. Then we will look at how machine learning techniques can help create a more adaptive ALS control system. We will examine reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms and their relationship to optimizing resource utilization in an ALS system. Finally, we will present an innovative multistep genetic algorithm that generates control strategies that perform much better than traditional reinforcement learning or traditional genetic algorithms.

This assumption becomes false in high dimensions with finite samples due to the curse of dimensionality. The nearest neighbor rule introduces severe bias under these conditions. We propose a locally adaptive neighborhood morphing classification method to try to minimize bias. We use local support vector machine learning to estimate an effective metric for producing neighborhoods that are elongated along less discriminant feature dimensions and constricted along most discriminant ones. As a result, the class conditional probabilities can be expected to be approximately constant in the modified neighborhoods, whereby better classification performance can be achieved The efficacy of our method is validated and compared against other competing techniques using a number of data sets.

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "Integral Image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers[5]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.

Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a novel speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer non-zero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling.

In low-level feature extraction, ICA produces independent image bases that emphasize edge information in the image data. In high-level classification, SVM classifies the ICA features as a face or non-faces. Our experimental results show that by using ICA features we obtained a larger margin of separation and fewer support vectors than by training SVM directly on the image data. This indicates better generalization performance, which was verified in our experiments.

These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. [1] proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state-estimation. This was extended to parameter-estimation by Wan and van der Merwe [2, 3]. The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of O(L-3)(1) for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameter-estimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an O(L-2) implementation. This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also O(L-3) for general state-estimation and O(L-2) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L-3)). In addition, the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances.

Existing work in classification rule learning assumes the goal is to produce categorical classifications to maximize classification accuracy, Recent work in machine learning has pointed out the limitations of classification accuracy: when class distributions are skewed, or error costs are unequal, an accuracy maximizing rule set can perforin poorly. A more flexible use of a rule set is to produce instance scores indicating the likelihood that an instance belongs to a given class. With such an ability, we can apply rulesets effectively when distributions are skewed or error costs are unequal. This paper empirically investigates different strategies for evaluating rule sets when the goal is to maximize the scoring (ROC) performance.

The proposed approach consists of three phases. fuzzy-rule generating, fuzzy-rule encoding and fuzzy-rule evolution. In the fuzzy-rule generating phase, a number of fuzzy rules are randomly generated. In the fuzzy-rule encoding phase, all the rules generated are translated into fixed-length bit strings to form an initial population, In the fuzzy-rule evolution phase, genetic operations and credit assignment are applied at the rule level. The proposed mining approach chooses good individuals in the population for mating, gradually creating better offspring fuzzy rules. A concise and compact fuzzy rule base is thus constructed effectively without human expert intervention.

However it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification is based on only single high-confidence rule. In this study, we propose a new associative classification method, CMAR, i.e., Classification based on Multiple Association Rules. The method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, FP-growth, constructs a class distribution-associated FP-tree, and mines large database efficiently. Moreover, it applies a CR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is performed based on a weighted chi(2) analysis using multiple strong association rules. Our extensive experiments on 26 databases from UCI machine learning database repository, show that CMAR is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with CBA and C4.5. Moreover, our performance study, shows that the method is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported associative classification methods.

The problem of mining ordering rules is formulated as finding association between orderings of attribute values and the overall ordering of objects. An ordering rules may state that "if the value of an object x on an attribute a is ordered ahead of the value of another object y on the same attribute, then x is ordered ahead of y". For mining ordering rules, we first transform an ordered information table into a binary information, and then apply any standard machine learning and data mining algorithms. As an illustration, we analyze in detail Maclean's universities ranking for the year 2000.

We are incorporating minimal linguistic resources, i.e. basic morphological tagging and phrase chunking, to demonstrate that verb subcategorization, which is of great significance for developing robust natural language human computer interaction systems, could he achieved using large corpora, without having any general-purpose syntactic parser at all. In addition, apart from BBN and SVM, which have not previously used for this task, we have experimented with three well-known machine learning methods (Feed-Forward Back-Propagation Neural Networks, Learning Vector Quantization and Decision Tables), which are also being applied to the task of verb subcategorization frame detection for the first time, We argue that both BBN and SVM are well suited for learning to identify verb subcategorization frames. Empirical results will support this claim, Performance has been methodically evaluated using two different corpora types, one balanced and one domain-specific in order to determine the unbiased behaviour of the trained models. Limited training data are proved to endow with satisfactory results. We have been able to achieve precision exceeding 80% on the identification of subcategorization frames which were not known beforehand.

Moreover, the discovery of new meteorite samples is of great value because meteorites are the only significant source of extraterrestrial material available to scientists. In this paper we focus on the primary outcomes and technical lessons learned from the first field demonstration of autonomous search and in situ classification of Antarctic meteorites by a robot. Using a novel autonomous control architecture, specialized science sensing, combined manipulation and visual servoing, and Bayesian classification, the Nomad robot classified five indigenous meteorites during an expedition to the remote site of Elephant Moraine in January 2000. Nomad's expedition proved the rudiments of science autonomy and exemplified the merits of machine learning techniques for autonomous geological classification in real-world settings. On the other hand, the expedition showcased the difficulty in executing reliable robotic deployment of science sensors and a limited performance in the speed and coverage of autonomous search.

Most of the existing supervised classification methods are based on traditional statistics, which can provide ideal results when sample size is tending to infinity. However, only finite samples can be acquired in practice. In addition, many methods are constrained by high data dimension of hyperspectral images. In this paper, a novel learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is applied to hyperspectral data classification. This method does not suffer the limitations of data dimensionality and limited samples. The foundations of SVM have been developed by Vapnik and are gaining popularity in field of machine learning due to many attractive features and promising empirical performance. In our experiment, the support vectors, which are critical for classification, are obtained by learning from the training samples. Choosing appropriate kernel function and suitable parameters, better classification results are obtained.

Recent retrieval applications achieved rapid indexing and robust retrieval capabilities, but the precision of recognizing objects in video images is lower than object recognition using machine learning. In contrast with video retrieval, machine learning needs vast computational training time in advance and cannot handle similarity easily. To solve this problem, we present an image-based video recognition framework combined with video retrieval and object recognition. To develop an effective combination, we evaluated several retrieval methods and the support vector machine(SVM), which is one of the most popular supervised learning techniques. From experimental results, we found that the combination of extended color-pair retrieval and SVM using color location is the most effective pair for high precision and rapid indexing of video recognition system.

A SVM classifier can be learned from training data of relevance images and irrelevance images marked by users. Using the classifier, the system can retrieve more images relevant to the query in the database efficiently. Experiments were carried out on a large-size database of 9918 images. It shows that the interactive learning and retrieval process can find correct images increasingly. It also shows the generalization ability of SVM under the condition of limited training samples.

Our aim in this study is to discover common structural motifs (CSMs), which are related to specific domain or functions, within the secondary structures of ribosomal RNAs in a data set constructed. After applying data mining techniques to mine the common structural motifs, a machine learning approach is used to find significant discriminating common structural motifs from groups of organisms. By applying to several data sets constructed in this study, it suggests that the CSMs can provide effective information to classify organisms and help biologists understand the functions of ribosomal RNA. From the experiments of the classification of organisms and the construction of phylogenetic trees by CSMs mined, we find our approach is promising.

Functional genomics represents the next phase, that expands the biological investigation to studying the functionality of genes of a single organism as well as studying and correlating the functionality of genes across many different organisms. Recently developed methods for monitoring genome-wide mRNA expression changes hold the promise of allowing us to inexpensively gain insights into the function of unknown genes. In this paper we focus on evaluating the feasibility of using supervised machine learning methods for determining the function of genes based solely on their expression profiles. We experimentally evaluate the performance of traditional classification algorithms such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors on the yeast genome, and present new approaches for classification that improve the overall recall with moderate reductions in precision. Our experiments show that the accuracies achieved for different classes varies dramatically. In analyzing these results we show that the achieved accuracy is highly dependent on whether or not the genes of that class were significantly active during the various experimental conditions, suggesting that gene expression profiles can become a viable alternative to sequence similarity searches provided that the genes are observed under a wide range of experimental conditions.

This approach can be used to evaluate an MT system, tracking improvements over time; to aid in the kind of failure analysis that can help guide system development; and to select among alternative output strings. The method presented is fully automated and independent of source language, target language and domain.

We describe statistical comparisons of features of these aware sites in a train timetable spoken dialogue corpus, which reveal significant prosodic differences between such turns, compared with turns that 'correct' speech recognition errors as well as with 'normal' turns that are neither aware sites nor corrections. We then present machine learning results in which we show how prosodic features in combination with other automatically available features can predict whether or not a user turn was a normal turn, a correction, and/or an aware site.

The underlying idea is to use a separate system, constructed with the use of machine learning, to monitor the performance of the rule-based system. The training data for the second system is generated with the use of the rule-based system, thus avoiding the need for manual tagging. The disagreement of the two systems acts as a signal for updating the rule-based system. The generality of the approach is illustrated by applying it to large corpora in two different languages: Greek and French. The results are very encouraging, showing that this alternative use of machine learning can assist significantly in the maintenance of rule-based systems.

The usefulness is investigated of the sequence of system question types and the word graphs corresponding to the respective user utterances. By applying both rule-induction and memory-based learning techniques to data obtained with a Dutch train time-table information system, the current paper demonstrates that the aforementioned features indeed lead to a method for problem detection that performs significantly above baseline. The results are interesting from a dialogue perspective since they employ features that are present in the majority of spoken dialogue systems and can be obtained with little or no computational overhead. The results are interesting from a machine learning perspective, since they show that the rule-based method performs significantly better than the memory-based method, because the former is better capable of representing interactions between features.

Among them, the Winnow algorithm has been argued to be particularly suitable for NLP problems, due to its robustness to irrelevant features. However in theory, Winnow may not converge for nonseparable data. To remedy this problem, a modification called regularized Winnow has been proposed. In this paper, we apply this new method to text chunking. We show that this method achieves state of the art performance with significantly less computation than previous approaches.

In this paper, we propose the SVM ensemble. in which similar SVMs are employed to detect a specific pattern of customer fraudulent behavior, and majority strategy are used to issue fraud alarm. Compared with other machine learning models, such as MLP and SOM models, either the classification accuracy or the adaptability, of the SVM ensemble is remarkable. Our application simulation shows that our design hay better performance than our previously developed system.

Machine learning techniques are now being used to acquire this information. Using case-based reasoning, we present an autonomous agent, namely IRNA, which can retrieve intelligently the scientific papers with respect to the user request. IRNA, can not only rank the retrieved papers in accordance with their similarity degree to the user request, but also give anther ranking through which users will be able to increase their knowledge for the related research in a systematic manner. IRNA makes use of local library within which a limited number of papers specifications in the domain of intelligent system. At the present stage, this local library is created manually, however, a new framework is also explained that can do this task automatically through mining the information from the web, As a future work, we will plan to add this capability to IRNA.

It aims to adapt ana agent to an unknown environment according to rewards. Traditionally, from theoretical point of view, many reinforcement learning systems assume that the environment has Markovian properties. However it is important to treat non-Markovian environments in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. In this paper we use Profit Sharing (PS) as a reinforcement learning,,system arid discuss the rationality of PS in multi-agent environments. Especially, We classify non-Markovian environments and discuss how to share a reward among reinforcement,ment learning agents.

This has driven the need for automated test and diagnostic tools. As test and diagnosis is a high-level human activity, Al-based solutions have been pursued. This has been an active research area for some decades, but the industrial acceptance of Al approaches, particularly in cost-sensitive areas, has not been high. This paper reviews the history and current state of Al in test and diagnosis, discusses future challenges, and introduces the authors' work in addressing some of these challenges in a diagnostic context.

The method can thus be used for: (1) displaying high dimensional data, especially very large datasets; (2) recognizing patterns and clusters, with the level of approximation controllable by the user; (3) approximating the patterns in data to various degrees; (4) preliminary analysis for determining the number of outputs of the novel neural network shown in this manuscript; (5) creating an unsupervised learning network (of the multiplicative or AND kind) that can be used to specialize itself to clustering large amounts of high-dimensional data, and finally; (6) reducing high dimensional data to basically three-dimensions for intuitive comprehension by wrapping the data on a torus [1]. The method can easily be extended to include vector time series. The natural space for high dimensional data using the natural Hamming metric is a torus. The specifically constructed novel neural network can then be trained or fine-tuned using machine-learning procedures on the original data or the approximated/normalized data. Furthermore we can determine approximately the minimal dimensionality of the phenomena that the data represent.

This technique is known as Feature subset selection. This feature selection technique is performed in order to reduce hypothesis search space, to reduce storage, and enhance the performance of the data mining, or machine learning algorithms. In recent years researchers have been actively involved and are focusing on this particular problem from the perspective of machine learning. This paper will briefly study the existing approaches to select features. Also, we will study the effectiveness of granular information to feature selection.

Therefore, the former rules sets obtained from the database require updating. In this paper, based on rough set theory, attribute-voting method for rule updating is presented. And, a general strategy for classification and rule updating using rough set theory is put forward. Decision-makers and analysts must distinguish new patterns from others or sort new members into the previous patterns. Therefore, the importance of their subjective initiative is emphasized, instead of depending only on machine. In the end, two examples illustrate that the view is reasonable.

The discussion is based on the following issues: dialectics, I-ching and a hypothesis on unified field theory. Metabolism is another crucial issue in neutrosophy, that may probably refresh the definition, logical structure and the ontology of <Neut-A> presented by Florentin Smarandache. This is shown in the discussion on the representation of metabolism, where the paper suggests a conjunction point between neutrosophy and machine learning including neural learning.

Bader's quantum topological atoms in molecules (AIM) theory for use in quantitative structure-property/activity relationship (QSPR/QSAR) modeling. Central to this structure representation using quantum topology (StruQT) are critical points located on the electron density distribution of the molecules. Other gradient fields such as the Laplacian of the electron density distribution can also be used. The type of critical point of particular interest is the bond critical point (BCP) which is here characterized by using the following three parameters: electron density rho, the Laplacian del rho and the ellipticity epsilon. This representation has the advantage that there is no need to probe a large number of lattice points in 3D space to capture the important parts of the 3D electronic structure as is necessary in, e.g. comparative field analysis (CoMFA). We tested the new structure representation by predicting the wavelength of the lowest UV transition for a system of 18 anthocyanidins. Different quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models are constructed using several chemometric/machine learning methods such as standard partial least squares regression (PLS), truncated PLS variable selection, genetic algorithm-based variable selection and genetic programming (GP). These models identified bonds that either take part in decreasing or increasing the dominant excitation wavelength. The models also correctly emphasized on the involvement of the conjugated pi system for predicting the wavelength through flagging the BCP ellipticity parameters as important for this particular data set.

The knowledge base (in the form of a decision tree) for the expert system for identifying the suitable habitat, was induced by automated machine learning from recorded bear sightings, and then linked to the GIS thematic layers for subsequent habitat/non-habitat classification of the entire study area. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier was 87% (KHAT 73%). The decision tree mostly agreed with the existing domain knowledge. For the study area the main factors considered by the expert system to be important for brown bear habitat were the percentage of forest (positive), proximity to settlements (negative) and elevation above see (positive), however the decision tree did not account for habitat patch size. After filtering out habitat patches smaller than 5000 ha in GIS, the accuracy increased to 89% (KHAT 77%). Whereas 88% of the habitat was within forests, only 33% of all forests were considered suitable as habitat. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Siegel, EV; Mckeown, KR				Siegel, EV; Mckeown, KR			Learning methods to combine linguistic indicators: Improving aspectual classification and revealing linguistic insights	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article								Aspectual classification maps verbs to a small set of primitive categories in order to reason about time. This classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal relationships, and is therefore a required component for many natural language applications. A verb's aspectual category can be predicted by co-occurrence frequencies between the verb and certain linguistic modifiers. These frequency measures, called linguistic indicators, are chosen by linguistic insights. However, linguistic indicators used in isolation are predictively incomplete, and are therefore insufficient when used individually. In this article, we compare three supervised machine learning methods for combining multiple linguistic indicators for aspectual classification: decision trees, genetic programming, and logistic regression. A set of 14 indicators are combined for classification according to two aspectual distinctions. This approach improves the classification performance for both distinctions, as evaluated over unrestricted sets of verbs occurring across two corpora. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the linguistic indicators and provides a much-needed full-scale method for automatic aspectual classification. Moreover, the models resulting from learning reveal several linguistic insights that are relevant to aspectual classification. We also compare supervised learning methods with an unsupervised method for this task.

A novel machine learning system is presented which is used to acquire knowledge relating to a specific task. Learned feedback from high-level to low-level processes is introduced as a means of achieving robust task-specific segmentation. The system has been implemented and trained on a number of scenarios with differing tasks from which results are presented and discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The data were analyzed with respect to the cataract, type of diabetes, retinopathy and blood-aqueous humor barrier damage. Intraocular production of IgG was detected in diabetic patients, since the IgG index values were increased in some diabetic groups (especially those with type I diabetes and retinopathy). Comparison of numerical methods and clonal IgG detection suggested that intraocular IgG patterns in diabetes are predominately polyclonal. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was pathological in serum and aqueous humor of patients with type I diabetes and to a lesser extent in the type II diabetes group. Machine learning system based on C5.0 classifier extracted 98.5% accurate rules for discrimination of the senile cataract group, diabetes group and diabetic retinopathy group. Our results confirm that the combination of immunochemical and numerical methods with a proper statistical analysis may contribute to the diagnosis of the pathologic ocular immune response and the related retinal or vascular disorders in diabetes. Significant savings in laboratory material and efforts may be obtained by means of the machine learning based optimization of the tests.

It is shown that this notation defines the Canter set and Smale horseshoe map representation of the genetic code, the classic table arrangement and Siemion one-step mutation ring of the code. Gray code solutions to the problem of defining codon positions on the [0, 1] interval, and an extension to the octal coding system, based on the linear block triple check code, are given. This result enables short block (word) decoding of the genetic code patterns. The block code is related to the minimization of errors during transcription and translation processes, which implies that the genetic code is error-correcting and not degenerate. Two algorithms for the representation of codons on the [0, 1] interval and the related binary trees are discussed. It is concluded that the ternary Canter set algorithm is the method of choice for this type of analysis and coding. This procedure enables the analysis of the six dimensional hypercube codon positions by means of a simple time series and/or 'logistic' difference equation. Finally, a unified concept of the genetic code linked to the Canter set and horseshoe map is introduced in the form of a classic combinatorial 4 colour necklace model with three horizontal frames consisting of 64 coloured pearls (bases) and vertically hanging decorations of triplets (codons). Three horizontal necklace frames define Crick's code without comma, and vertical necklace decorations define the evolutional code. Thus, the type of the code depends on the level or direction of observation. The exact location of the mRNA and complementary DNA coding groups of triplets within a frame is determined. The latter enables decoding of long code block (language) patterns within the genetic code. This method of genetic code analysis is named Symbolic Canter Algorithm (SCA). The validity of the method was confirmed by 94% accurate classification of 50 proteins of known secondary structure (25 alpha -helices and 25 beta -sheets) with the C5.0 machine learning system. Nucleotide strings of proteins transcribed by SCA were used for the analysis. Spectral Fourier analysis of Pro-opiomelanocortin and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6 confirmed that the method might be also applied to the analysis of bioactive hormone and cytokine sequences.

The research of the future will likely be data driven. Symbolic and numeric data that are becoming available in large volumes will define the need for new data analysis techniques and tools. Data mining is an emerging area of computational intelligence that offers new theories, techniques, and tools for analysis of large data sets. In this paper, a novel approach for autonomous decision-making is developed based on the rough set theory of data mining. The approach has been tested on a medical data set for patients with lung abnormalities referred to as solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs), The two independent algorithms developed in this paper either generate an accurate diagnosis or make no decision. The methodolgy discussed in the paper depart from the developments in data mining as well as current medical literature, thus creating a variable approach for autonomous decision-making.

The dynamic "next-tier" problems such as multi-factor & nonlinear interactions, intermittent problems, dynamically changing processes or installing new processes, multiple products and the sheer volume of data can all make quickly finding and resolving problems an overwhelming task. Case studies of semiconductor wafer manufacturing problems show that Machine Learning technology can solve these problems. Presented, is a method using a combination of self-organizing neural networks and rule induction to identify the critical poor yield factors from normally collected wafer manufacturing data. Subsequent controlled experiments and process changes confirmed the solutions. Wafer yield problems were solved 10x faster than standard approaches; yield increases ranged from 3% to 15%; endangered customer product deliveries were saved.

J	Amin, A				Amin, A			Prototyping structural description using an inductive learning program	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							PARALLEL THINNING ALGORITHMS; PRINTED ARABIC TEXT; CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; BINARY PATTERNS; SYSTEM	Character recognition systems can contribute tremendously to the advancement of the automation process and can improve the interaction between man and machine in many applications, including office automation, cheque verification and a large variety of banking, business and data entry applications. The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of hand-printed Arabic characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over the large degree of variation between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example. The system was tested on a sample of handwritten characters from several individuals whose writing ranged from acceptable to poor in quality and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 89.65%.

J	Baluja, S				Baluja, S			Using labeled and unlabeled for probabilistic modeling of face orientation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						probabilistic modeling; face orientation discrimination; expectation maximization; unlabeled data; Bayesian models; machine learning; computer vision	RECOGNITION	This paper describes probabilistic modeling methods to solve the problem of discriminating between five facial orientations with very little labeled data. Three models are explored. The first model maintains no inter-pixel dependencies, the second model is capable of modeling a set of arbitrary pair-wise dependencies, and the last model allows dependencies only between neighboring pixels. We show that for all three of these models, the accuracy of the learned models can be greatly improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training images with a large set of unlabeled images using Expectation-Maximization. This is important because it is often difficult to obtain image labels, while many unlabeled images are readily available. Through a large set of empirical tests, we examine the benefits of unlabeled data for each of the models. By using only two randomly selected labeled examples per class, we can discriminate between the five facial orientations with an accuracy of 94%; with six labeled examples, we achieve an accuracy of 98%.

J	DeFries, RS; Chan, JCW				DeFries, RS; Chan, JCW			Multiple criteria for evaluating machine learning algorithms for land cover classification from satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; CLASSIFIERS; TREES	Operational monitoring of land cover from satellite data will require automated procedures for analyzing large volumes of data. We propose multiple criteria for assessing algorithms for this task. In addition to standard classification accuracy measures, we propose criteria to account for computational resources requires by the algorithms, stability of the algorithms, and robustness to noise in the training data. We also propose that classification accuracy take account, through estimation of misclassification costs, of unequal consequences to the user depending on which cover types are confused. In this article, we apply these criteria to three variants of decision tree classifiers, a standard decision tree implemented in C5.0 and two techniques recently proposed in the machine learning literature known as "bagging" and "boosting." Each of these algorithms are applied to two data sets, a global land cover classification from 8 km AVHRR data and a Landsat Thematic Mapper scene in Peru. Results indicate comparable accuracy of the three variants of the decision tree algorithms on the two data sets, with boosting providing marginally higher accuracies. The bagging and boosting algorithms, however, are both substantially more stable and more robust to noise in the training data compared with the standard C5.0 decision tree. The bagging algorithm is most costly in terms of computational resources while the standard decision tree is least costly. The results illustrate that the choice of the most suitable algorithm requires consideration of a suite of criteria in additions to the traditional accuracy measures and that there are likely to be trade-offs between algorithm performance and required computational resources.

It is an interdisciplinary activity, taking ideas and methods from statistics, machine learning, database technology, and other areas. It poses novel challenges, in part arising from the sheer size of modem data sets. Although there is no doubt that it addresses important questions, there are deep issues to be resolved relating to data quality and the nature of inference. Statisticians have an important role to play in resolving these issues.

Here we present a novel data-mining approach to predicting protein functional class from sequence. This method is based on a combination of inductive logic programming clustering and rule learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the M, tuberculosis and E. coli genomes, and identify biologically interpretable rules which predict protein functional class from information only available from the sequence. These rules predict 65% of the ORFs with no assigned function in M, tuberculosis and 24% of those in E, coli, with an estimated accuracy of 60-80% (depending on the level of functional assignment). The rules are founded on a combination of detection of remote homology, convergent evolution and horizontal gene transfer.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a historical cohort study of women delivered of live-born singleton neonates in 1995 through 1997 (22,157). The frequency of cesarean delivery was 17%; 78 variables were used for analysis. Decision tree rule-based methods and logistic regression models were each applied to the same 50% of the sample to develop the predictive training models and these models were tested on the remaining 50%. RESULTS: Decision tree receiver operating characteristic curve areas were as follows: nulliparous, 0.82; parous, 0.93. Logistic receiver operating characteristic curve areas were as follows: nulliparous, 0.86; parous, 0.93. Decision tree methods and logistic regression methods used similar predictive variables; however, logistic methods required more variables and yielded less intelligible models. Among the 6 decision tree building methods tested, the strict minimum message length criterion yielded decision trees that were small yet accurate. Risk factor variables were identified in 676 nulliparous cesarean deliveries (69%) and 419 parous cesarean deliveries (47.6%). CONCLUSION: Decision tree models can be used to predict cesarean delivery. Models built with strict minimum message length decision trees have the following attributes: Their performance is comparable to that of logistic regression; they are small enough to be intelligible to physicians; they reveal causal dependencies among variables not detected by logistic regression; they can handle missing values more easily than can logistic methods; they predict cesarean deliveries that lack a categorized risk factor variable.

Finding names in free text is an important task in many text-based applications. Most previous approaches were based on hand-crafted modules encoding language and genre-specific knowledge. These approaches had at least two shortcomings: they required large amounts of time and expertise to develop and were not easily portable to new languages and genres. This paper describes an extensible system that automatically combines weak evidence from different, easily available sources: parts-of-speech tags, dictionaries, and surface-level syntactic information such as capitalization and punctuation. Individually, each piece of evidence is insufficient for robust name detection. However, the combination of evidence, through standard machine learning techniques, yields a system that achieves performance equivalent to the best existing hand-crafted approaches.

The premise is that natural language processing depends not only on the grammatical rules but also on entities (whatever the agents are communicating about), their attributes, and supported events (in a time/space continuum). We call the collection of an entity's associated attributes a state. The description of a concept is refined when new information about the concept is encountered through discovery of consistency between the attributes belonging to different image instances.

Since one of the main obstacles to the efficient use of natural language interfaces is the high amount of required manual knowledge engineering, we provide an adaptive architecture to automate the acquisition of linguistic knowledge. We apply a machine learning module based on an eXtended Semantic Enumeration (XSE) tree to activate linguistic tests from semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic analyses during the traversal of the tree. The XSE-tree is built automatically based on past questions without the need for any additional linguistic knowledge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we discuss the potential sources of errors associated with the identification of compounds, the representation of their structures, and the calculation of chemical descriptors. It is based on a case study where machine learning techniques were applied to data from noncongeneric compounds and a complex toxicologic end point (carcinogenicity). We propose methods applicable to the routine quality control of large chemical datasets, but our main intention is to raise awareness about this topic and to open a discussion about quality assurance in predictive toxicology. The accuracy and reproducibility of toxicity data will be reported in another paper.

Thus all available examples can be used in the classifier; no examples need to be withheld to compute error bounds. The estimate used in the bound is an extension of the holdout estimate.

J	Sebald, DJ; Bucklew, JA				Sebald, DJ; Bucklew, JA			Support vector machine techniques for nonlinear equalization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						decision feedback SVM; ISI; nonlinear equalization; support vector machine	RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	The emerging machine learning technique called support vector machines is proposed as a method for performing nonlinear equalization in communication systems. The support vector machine has the advantage that a smaller number of parameters for the model can he identified in a manner that does not require the extent of prior information or heuristic assumptions that some previous techniques require. Furthermore, the optimization method of a support vector machine is quadratic programming, which is a well studied and understood mathematical programming technique, Support vector machine simulations are carried out on nonlinear problems previously studied by other researchers using neural networks. This allows initial comparison against other techniques to determine the feasibility of using the proposed method for nonlinear detection. Results show that support vector machines perform as well as neural networks on the nonlinear problems investigated, A method is then proposed to introduce derision feedback processing to support vector machines to address the fact that intersymbol interference (ISI) data generates input vectors having temporal correlation, whereas a standard support vector machine assumes independent input vectors, presenting the problem from the viewpoint of the pattern space illustrates the utility of a bank of support vector machines. This approach yields a nonlinear processing method that Is somewhat different than the nonlinear decision feedback method whereby the linear feedback filter of the decision feedback equalizer is replaced by a Volterra filter. A simulation using a linear system shows that the proposed method performs equally to a conventional decision feedback equalizer for this problem.

J	Suc, D; Bratko, I				Suc, D; Bratko, I			Skill modeling through symbolic reconstruction of operator's trajectories	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						control system synthesis; human-centered design; machine learning		Controlling a complex dynamic system, such as a plane or a crane, usually requires a skilled operator. Such control skill is typically hard to reconstruct through introspection. Therefore an attractive approach to the reconstruction of control skill involves machine learning from operator's control traces, also known as behavioral cloning. In the most common approach to behavioral cloning, a controller is induced as a direct mapping from system states to actions. Unfortunately, such controllers usually suffer from lack of robustness and lack typical elements of human control strategies, such as subgoals and substages of the control plan, In this paper, we investigate a novel approach, We apply the GoldHorn program to induce from the operator's trajectories a set of symbolic constraints. These are then used together with a locally weighted regression model to determine the next action. Using the Acrobot problem in a case study, this approach showed significant improvements both in terms of control performance and transparency of induced clones.

J	Moens, MF; Dumortier, J				Moens, MF; Dumortier, J			Text categorization: the assignment of subject descriptors to magazine articles	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						automatic indexing; text categorization; machine learning	RETRIEVAL	Automatic text categorization is an important research area and has a potential for many text-based applications including text routing and filtering. Typical text classifiers learn from example texts that are manually categorized. When categorizing magazine articles with broad subject descriptors, we study three aspects of text classification: (1) effective selection of feature words and proper names that reflect the main topics of the text; (2) learning algorithms; and (3) improvement of the quality of the learned classifier by selection of examples. The chi(2) test, which is sometimes used for selecting terms that are highly related to a text class, is applied in a novel way when constructing a category weight vector. Despite a limited number of training examples, combining an effective feature selection with the chi(2) learning algorithm for training the text classifier results in an adequate categorization of new magazine articles.

J	Shin, CK; Park, SC				Shin, CK; Park, SC			A machine learning approach to yield management in semiconductor manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference of Production Research(ICPR-15)	AUG, 1999	LIMERICK, IRELAND		UNIV LIMERICK		SYSTEM	Yield improvement is one of the most important topics in semiconductor manufacturing. Traditional statistical methods are no longer feasible nor efficient, if possible, in analysing the vast amounts of data in a modern semiconductor manufacturing process. For instance, a typical wafer fabrication process has more than 1000 process parameters to record on a single wafer and one manufacturing plant may produce tens of thousands wafers a day. Traditional approaches have limits in extracting the full benefits of the data. Therefore, the manufacturing data is poorly exploited even in the most sophisticated processes. Now it is widely accepted that machine learning techniques can provide powerful tools for continuous quality improvement in a large and complex process such as semiconductor manufacturing. In this work, memory based reasoning (MBR) and neural network (NN) learning are combined for yield improvement and an integrated framework is proposed for a yield management system based on hybrid machine learning techniques. In this hybrid system of NN and MBR, the feature weight set which is calculated from the trained neural network plays the core role in connecting both learning strategies and the explanation on prediction can be given by obtaining and presenting the most similar examples from the case base. The proposed system has advantages in typical semiconductor manufacturing problems such as scalability to large datasets, high dimensions and adaptability to dynamic situations.

J	Siromoney, A; Inoue, K				Siromoney, A; Inoue, K			Consistency and completeness in rough sets	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge discovery; machine learning; rough sets; inconsistency		Consistency and completeness are defined in the context of rough set theory and shown to be related to the lower approximation and upper approximation, respectively. A member of a composed set (union of elementary sets) that is consistent with respect to a concept, surely belongs to the concept. An element that is not a member of a composed set that is complete with respect to a concept, surely does not belong to the concept. A consistent rule and a complete rule are useful in addition to any other rules learnt to describe a concept. When an element satisfies the consistent rule, it surely belongs to the concept, and when it does not satisfy the complete rule, it surely does not belong to the concept. In other cases, the other learnt rules are used. The results in the finite universe are extended to the infinite universe, thus introducing a rough set model for the learning from examples paradigm. The results in this paper have application in knowledge discovery or learning from database environments that are inconsistent, but at the same time demand accurate and definite knowledge. This study of consistency and completeness in rough sets also lays the foundation for related work at the intersection of rough set theory and inductive logic programming.

J	Argamon-Engelson, S; Koppel, M; Walters, H				Argamon-Engelson, S; Koppel, M; Walters, H			Maximizing theory accuracy through selective reinterpretation	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						logical theories; theory revision; probabilistic theories; flawed domain theories; approximate reasoning; machine learning	KNOWLEDGE	Existing methods for exploiting flawed domain theories depend on the use of a sufficiently large set of training examples for diagnosing and repairing flaws in the theory. In this paper, we offer a method of theory reinterpretation that makes only marginal use of training examples. The idea is as follows: Often a small number of flaws in a theory can completely destroy the theory's classification accuracy. Yet it is clear that valuable information is available even from such flawed theories. For example, an instance with several independent proofs in a slightly flawed theory is certainly more likely to be correctly classified as positive than an instance with only a single proof. This idea can be generalized to a numerical notion of "degree of provedness" which measures the robustness of proofs or refutations for a given instance. This "degree of provedness" can be easily computed using a "soft" interpretation of the theory. Given a ranking of instances based on the values so obtained, all that is required to classify instances is to determine some cutoff threshold above which instances are classified as positive. Such a threshold can be determined on the basis of a small set of training examples. For theories with a few localized flaws, we improve the method by "rehardening": interpreting only parts of the theory softly, while interpreting the rest of the theory in the usual manner. Isolating those parts of the theory that should be interpreted softly can be done on the basis of a small number of training examples. Softening, with or without rehardening, can be used by itself as a quick way of handling theories with suspected flaws where few training examples are available. Additionally softening and rehardening can be used in conjunction with other methods as a meta-algorithm for determining which theory revision methods are appropriate for a given theory.

J	Bell, DA; Wang, H				Bell, DA; Wang, H			A formalism for relevance and its application in feature subset selection	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						machine learning; knowledge discovery; data mining; relevance; feature subset selection	ALGORITHMS; PRINCIPLE	The notion of relevance is used in many technical fields. In the areas of machine learning and data mining, for example, relevance is frequently used as a measure in feature subset selection (FSS). In previous studies, the interpretation of relevance has varied and its connection to FSS has been loose. In this paper a rigorous mathematical formalism is proposed for relevance, which is quantitative and normalized. To apply the formalism in FSS, a characterization is proposed for FSS: preservation of learning information and minimization of joint entropy. Based on the characterization, a tight connection between relevance and FSS is established: maximizing the relevance of features to the decision attribute, and the relevance of the decision attribute to the features. This connection is then used to design an algorithm for FSS. The algorithm is linear in the number of instances and quadratic in the number of features. The algorithm is evaluated using 23 public datasets, resulting in an improvement in prediction accuracy on 16 datasets, and a loss in accuracy on only 1 dataset. This provides evidence that both the formalism and its connection to FSS are sound.

FSS-EBNA is an evolutionary, population-based, randomized search algorithm, and it can be executed when domain knowledge is not available. A wrapper approach, over Naive-Bayes and ID3 learning algorithms, is used to evaluate the goodness of each visited solution. FSS-EBNA, based on the EDA (Estimation of Distribution Algorithm) paradigm, avoids the use of crossover and mutation operators to evolve the populations, in contrast to Genetic Algorithms. In absence of these operators, the evolution is guaranteed by the factorization of the probability distribution of the best solutions found in a generation of the search. This factorization is carried out by means of Bayesian networks. Promising results are achieved in a variety of tasks where domain knowledge is not available. The paper explains the main ideas of Feature Subset Selection, Estimation of Distribution Algorithm and Bayesian networks, presenting related work about each concept. A study about the 'overfitting' problem in the Feature Subset Selection process is carried out, obtaining a basis to define the stopping criteria of the new algorithm. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results. Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97 802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets.

J	Dhar, V; Chou, D; Provost, F				Dhar, V; Chou, D; Provost, F			Discovering interesting patterns for investment decision making with GLOWER - A genetic learner overlaid with entropy reduction	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						data mining; knowledge discovery; machine learning; genetic algorithms; financial prediction; rule learning; investment decision making; systematic trading	ALGORITHM	Prediction in financial domains is notoriously difficult for a number of reasons. First, theories tend to be weak or non-existent, which makes problem formulation open ended by forcing us to consider a large number of independent variables and thereby increasing the dimensionality of the search space. Second, the weak relationships among variables tend to be nonlinear, and may hold only in limited areas of the search space. Third, in financial practice, where analysts conduct extensive manual analysis of historically well performing indicators, a key is to find the hidden interactions among variables that perform well in combination. Unfortunately, these are exactly the patterns that the greedy search biases incorporated by many standard rule learning algorithms will miss. In this paper, we describe and evaluate several variations of a new genetic learning algorithm (GLOWER) on a variety of data sets. The design of GLOWER has been motivated by financial prediction problems, but incorporates successful ideas from tree induction and rule learning. We examine the performance of several GLOWER variants on two UCI data sets as well as on a standard financial prediction problem (S&P500 stock returns), using the results to identify one of the better variants for further comparisons. We introduce a new (to KDD) financial prediction problem (predicting positive and negative earnings surprises), and experiment with GLOWER, contrasting it with tree- and rule-induction approaches. Our results are encouraging, showing that GLOWER has the ability to uncover effective patterns for difficult problems that have weak structure and significant nonlinearities.

We first present the COA challenge problem and the architecture of Disciple-COA, a learning agent shell from the Disciple family. Then we present the knowledge acquisition experiment, detailing both the expert-Disciple interactions, and the automatic knowledge base development processes that take place as a result of these interactions. The results of this experiment provide strong evidence that the Disciple approach is a viable solution to the knowledge acquisition bottleneck. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

J	Li, Y; Zhang, C; Swan, JR				Li, Y; Zhang, C; Swan, JR			An information filtering model on the Web and its application in JobAgent	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						information filtering; rough set; intelligent information agent	RETRIEVAL; INFERENCE; RELEVANCE	Machine-learning techniques play the important roles for information filtering. The main objective of machine-learning is to obtain users' pro files. To decrease the burden of on-line learning, it is important to seek suitable structures to represent user information needs. This paper proposes a model for information filtering on the Web. The user information need is described into two levels in this model: profiles on category level, and Boolean queries on document level. To efficiently estimate the relevance between the user information need and documents, the user information need is treated as a rough set on the space of documents. The rough set decision theory is used to classify the new documents according to the user information need. In return for this, the new documents are divided into three parts: positive region, boundary region, and negative region. An experimental system JobAgent is also presented to verify this model, and it shows that the rough set based model can provide an efficient approach to solve the information overload problem.

J	Kattan, MW; Cooper, RB				Kattan, MW; Cooper, RB			A simulation of factors affecting machine learning techniques: an examination of partitioning and class proportions	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						machine learning; neural networks; ID3; CART; recursive pactitioning; simulation	EXPERT SYSTEMS; NEURAL NETWORKS; RULE INDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS; DESIGN	Machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and rule induction, are becoming popular alternatives to traditional statistical techniques for solving classification problems. However, much of the research has been devoted to comparing performances upon sample data sets, with little attention paid to why a technique sometimes outperforms another. This study describes a simulation which examined the effects of factors with theoretical support for their differential impacts upon three machine learning techniques (a backpropagation neural network and two rule induction techniques: CART and ID3) and discriminant analysis. The results demonstrate significant differences in the techniques' abilities to reduce overfitting, to form diagonal partitions, and to compensate for variations between actual and sample data class proportions. This helps explain why a particular technique may perform well in one context and not in another. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To this end, we are creating isaac, a team analyst agent for post hoc, offline agent-team analysis. ISAAC'S novelty stems from a key design constraint that arises in team analysis: Multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. These heterogeneous team models are automatically acquired by machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC uses multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. This article presents ISAAC'S general conceptual framework and its application in the RoboCup soccer domain, where ISAAC was awarded the RoboCup Scientific Challenge Award.

J	Wu, XD				Wu, XD			Building intelligent learning database systems	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article								Induction and deduction are two opposite operations in data-mining applications. Induction extracts knowledge in the form of, say, rules or decision trees from existing data, and deduction applies induction results to interpret new data. An intelligent learning database (ILDB) system integrates machine-learning techniques with database and knowledge base technology. It starts with existing database technology and performs both induction and deduction. The integration of database technology, induction (from machine learning), and deduction (from knowledge-based systems) plays a key role in the construction of ILDB systems, as does the design of efficient induction and deduction algorithms. This article presents a system structure for ILDB systems and discusses practical issues for ILDB applications, such as instance selection and structured induction.

MDDs are an exceptionally good representation for generalized decomposition because they are canonical and they can represent very large functions. Algorithms developed in this paper are for Boolean/multivalued input and output, completely/incompletely specified functions with application to logic synthesis, machine learning, data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. We compare the run-times and decision diagram sizes of our algorithms to existing decomposition partitioning algorithms based on decision diagrams. The comparisons show that our algorithms are faster and do not result in exponential diagram sizes when decomposing functions with small bound sets.

It is based on a genetic-neuro learning algorithm. The mixed-genetic coding adopted involves only the premises of the fuzzy rules. The conclusions are derived through a least-squares solution of an over-determined system using the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, The paper presents the results obtained with C++ software called GEFREX that implements the proposed algorithm. The main characteristic of the algorithm is the compactness of the fuzzy systems extracted. Several comparisons ranging from approximation problems, classification problems, and time series predictions show that GEFREX reaches a smaller error than found in previous works With the same or a smaller number of rules, Further, it succeeds in identifying significant features. Although the SVD is used extensively, the learning time is decidedly reduced in comparison with previous work.

The gait phase detectors were synthesized from two rule induction algorithms, Rough Sets (RS) and Adaptive Logic Networks (ALNs), and compared with to a previously reported stance/swing detector based-on a hand crafted, rule based algorithm. Data was sampled at 100 Hz and the detection errors determined at each sample for 50 steps, For three able bodied subjects, the sample by sample accuracy of stance/swing detection ranged within 94-97%, 87-94%, and 87-95% for the RS, ALN, and the handcrafted methods, respectively. A heuristically formulated postdetector filter improved the RS and ALN detectors' accuracy to 98%, RS and ALN also detected five gait phases to an overall accuracy of 82-89% and 86-91%, respectively. The postdetector filter localized the errors to the phase transitions, but did not change the detection accuracy. The average duration of the error at each transition was 40 ms and 23 ms: for RS and ALN, respectively. When implemented on a microcontroller, the RS-based detector executed ten times faster and required one tenth of the memory than the ALN-based detector.

Vehicle engine diagnosis often involves multiple signal analysis, The developed system first partitions a leading signal into small segments representing physical events or stateds based on wavelet multi-resolution analysis. Second, by applying the segmentation result of the leading signal to the other signals, the detailed properties of each segment, including inter-signal relationships, are extracted to form a feature vector, Finally, a fuzzy intelligent system is used to learn diagnostic features from a training set containing feature vectors extracted from signal segments at various vehicle states, The fuzzy system applies its diagnostic knowledge to classify signals as abnormal or normal. The implementation of the system is described and experiment results are presented.

This work differs from current research in building detection in so far as it utilizes the ability of Bayesian Networks to provide probabilistic methods for evidence combination and, via training, to determine how such evidence should be weighted to maximize classification. In this vein, then, we have also utilized expert performance to not only configure the network values but also to adapt the feature extraction pre-processing units to fit human behavior as closely as possible. Results from digital orthophotos of the Washington DC area prove that such an approach is feasible, robust and worth further analysis.

We create patterns of attachments by classifying a collection of prepositional relations derived from Treebank parses. As a by-product, the arguments of every prepositional relation are semantically disambiguated. Attachment decisions are generated as the result of a learning process, that builds upon some of the most popular current statistical and machine learning techniques.

J	Garcia-Martinez, R; Borrajo, D				Garcia-Martinez, R; Borrajo, D			An integrated approach of learning, planning, and execution	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						autonomous intelligent systems; embedded machine learning; planning and execution; reinforcement learning; theory formation; theory revision; unsupervised machine learning	MOBILE ROBOT; PLANS	Agents (hardware or software) that act autonomously in an environment have to be able to integrate three basic behaviors: planning, execution, and learning. This integration is mandatory when the agent has no knowledge about how its actions can affect the environment, how the environment reacts to its actions, or, when the agent does not receive as an explicit input, the goals it must achieve. Without an "a priori" theory, autonomous agents should be able to self-propose goals, set-up plans for achieving the goals according to previously learned models of the agent and the environment, and learn those models from past experiences of successful and failed executions of plans. Planning involves selecting a goal to reach and computing a set of actions that will allow the autonomous agent to achieve the goal. Execution deals with the interaction with the environment by application of planned actions, observation of resulting perceptions, and control of successful achievement of the goals. Learning is needed to predict the reactions of the environment to the agent actions, thus guiding the agent to achieve its goals more efficiently. In this context, most of the learning systems applied to problem solving have been used to learn control knowledge for guiding the search for a plan, but few systems have focused on the acquisition of planning operator descriptions. As an example, currently, one of the most used techniques for the integration of (a way of) planning, execution, and learning is reinforcement learning. However, they usually do not consider the representation of action descriptions, so they cannot reason in terms of goals and ways of achieving those goals. In this paper, we present an integrated architecture, lope, that learns operator definitions, plans using those operators, and executes the plans for modifying the acquired operators. The resulting system is domain-independent, and we have performed experiments in a robotic framework. The results clearly show that the integrated planning, learning, and executing system outperforms the basic planner in that domain.

J	Ferris, MC; Munson, TS				Ferris, MC; Munson, TS			Modeling languages and Condor: metacomputing for optimization	MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING			English	Article								A generic framework is postulated for utilizing the computational resources provided by a meta-computer to concurrently solve a large number of optimization problems generated by a modeling language. An example of the framework using the Condor resource manager and the AMPL and GAMS modeling languages us provided. A mixed integer programming formulation of a feature selection problem from machine learning is used to test the mechanism developed. Due to this application's computational requirements, the ability to perform optimizations in parallel is necessary in order to obtain results within a reasonable amount of time. Details about the simple and easy to use tool and implementation are presented so that other modelers with applications generating many independent mathematical programs can take advantage of it to significantly reduce solution times.

J	Drawid, A; Gerstein, M				Drawid, A; Gerstein, M			A Bayesian system integrating expression data with sequence patterns for localizing proteins: Comprehensive application to the yeast genome	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						proteomics; bioinformatics; machine learning; cDNA microarray analysis; subcellular localization	MEMBRANE-SPANNING PROTEINS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; STRUCTURAL CENSUS; SORTING SIGNALS; SUBCELLULAR LOCATION; LOCALIZATION SITES; NEURAL NETWORKS; PREDICTION; GENE; HELICES	We develop a probabilistic system for predicting the subcellular localization of proteins and estimating the relative population of the various compartments in yeast. Our system employs a Bayesian approach, updating a protein's probability of being in a compartment, based on a diverse range of 30 features. These range from specific motifs (e.g. signal sequences or the HDEL motif) to overall properties of a sequence (e.g. surface composition or isoelectric point) to whole-genome data (e.g. absolute mRNA expression levels or their fluctuations). The strength of our approach is the easy integration of many features, particularly the whole-genome expression data. We construct a training and testing set of similar to 1300 yeast proteins with an experimentally known localization from merging, filtering, and standardizing the annotation in the MIPS, Swiss-Prot and YPD databases, and we achieve 75% accuracy on individual protein predictions using this dataset. Moreover, we are able to estimate the relative protein population of the various compartments without requiring a definite localization for every protein. This approach, which is based on an analogy to formalism in quantum mechanics, gives better accuracy in determining relative compartment populations than that obtained by simply tallying the localization predictions for individual proteins (on the yeast proteins with known localization, 92% versus 74%). Our training and testing also highlights which of the 30 features are informative and which are redundant (19 being particularly useful). After developing our system, we apply it to the 4700 yeast proteins with currently unknown localization and estimate the relative population of the various compartments in the entire yeast genome. An unbiased prior is essential to this extrapolated estimate; for this, we use the MIPS localization catalogue, and adapt recent results on the localization of yeast proteins obtained by Snyder and colleagues using a minitransposon system.

Such a method is based on temporal abstractions and relies on the following steps: (i) 'pre-processing' of raw data through the application of suitable filtering techniques; (ii) 'extraction' from the pre-processed data of a set of abstract episodes (temporal abstractions); and (iii) 'post-processing' of temporal abstractions; the post-processing phase results in a new set of features that embeds high level information on the patient dynamics. The derived features set is used to obtain new knowledge through the application of machine learning algorithms. The paper describes in detail the application of this methodology and presents some results obtained on simulated data and on a data-set of four diabetic patients monitored for > 1 year.

J	Zupan, B; Demsar, J; Kattan, MW; Beck, JR; Bratko, I				Zupan, B; Demsar, J; Kattan, MW; Beck, JR; Bratko, I			Machine learning for survival analysis: a case study on recurrence of prostate cancer	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						survival analysis; censored data; machine learning; data weighting; prostate cancer recurrence; outcome prediction after radical prostatectomy; prognostic models in medicine	RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; DISEASE RECURRENCE; REGRESSION; NOMOGRAM	Machine learning techniques have recently received considerable attention, especially when used for the construction of prediction models from data. Despite their potential advantages over standard statistical methods, like their ability to model non-linear relationships and construct symbolic and interpretable models, their applications to survival analysis are at best rare, primarily because of the difficulty to appropriately handle censored data. In this paper we propose a schema that enables the use of classification methods - including machine learning classifiers - for survival analysis. To appropriately consider the follow-up time and censoring, we propose a technique that, for the patients for which the event did not occur and have short follow-up times, estimates their probability of event and assigns them a distribution of outcome accordingly. Since most machine learning techniques do not deal with outcome distributions, the schema is implemented using weighted examples. To show the utility of the proposed technique, we investigate a particular problem of building prognostic models for prostate cancer recurrence, where the sole prediction of the probability of event (and not its probability dependency on time) is of interest. A case study on preoperative and postoperative prostate cancer recurrence prediction shows that by incorporating this weighting technique the machine learning tools stand beside modern statistical methods and may, by inducing symbolic recurrence models, provide further insight to relationships within the modeled data.

These criteria are then used to analyze some published neural network systems. It is also shown that the property of monotonicity for the data is rather natural in this medical domain, and it has the potential to significantly improve the reliability of breast cancer diagnosis while maintaining a general representation pou er. A central part of this paper is devoted to the representation/narrow vicinity hypothesis, upon which existing computer-aided diagnostic methods heavily rely. The paper also develops a framework for determining the validity of this hypothesis. The same framework can be used to construct a diagnostic procedure with improved reliability.

J	Filipic, B; Junkar, M				Filipic, B; Junkar, M			Using inductive machine learning to support decision making in machining processes	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						inductive machine learning; technological databases; decision support; electrical discharge machining (EDM); grinding	KNOWLEDGE	In spite of their practical success, knowledge-based systems still suffer from considerable limitations. Specialized for problem solving in a narrow domain, most systems possess very limited knowledge and are rather inflexible. Moreover, building a knowledge base is the most critical phase in developing an expert system. In overcoming these limitations, existing machine learning techniques, capable of deriving concepts from data, can be effectively applied. This work focuses on machine learning from examples and its potential in discovering knowledge hidden in technological databases. Practically oriented studies of automating two-decision procedures related to machining processes are presented: classification of dielectric fluids used in electrical discharge machining, and tool selection in an industrial grinding process. The results show the approach is beneficial in preventing poor process performance and improving product quality.

J	Sette, S; Boullart, L				Sette, S; Boullart, L			An implementation of genetic algorithms for rule based machine learning	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						genetic based machine learning; learning classifier systems; fuzzy efficiency based classifier systems; textiles; production process		Genetic algorithms have given rise to two new fields of research where (global) optimisation is of crucial importance: 'Genetic Programming' and 'Genetic based Machine Learning' (GBML). In this paper the second domain (GBML) will be introduced. An overview of one of the first GBML implementations by Holland, also known as the Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) will be given. After describing and solving a well-known basic (educational) problem a more complex application of GBML is presented. The goal of this application is the automatic development of a rule set for an industrial production process. To this end, the case study on generating a rule set for predicting the spinnability in the fibre-to-yarn production process will be presented. A largely modified LCS, called Fuzzy Efficiency based Classifier System (FECS), originally designed by one of the authors, is used to solve this problem successfully. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Hong, TP; Wang, TT; Wang, SL; Chien, BC				Hong, TP; Wang, TT; Wang, SL; Chien, BC			Learning a coverage set of maximally general fuzzy rules by rough sets	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						machine learning; fuzzy set; rough set; data mining; expert system		Expert systems have been widely used in domains where mathematical models cannot be easily built, human experts are not available or the cost of querying an expert is high. Machine learning or data mining can extract desirable knowledge or interesting patterns from existing databases and ease the development bottleneck in building expert systems. In the past we proposed a method [Hong, T.P., Wang, T.T., Wang, S.L. (2000). Knowledge acquisition from quantitative data using the rough-set theory. Intelligent Data Analysis (in press).], which combined the rough set theory and the fuzzy set theory to produce all possible fuzzy rules from quantitative data. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to deal with the problem of producing a set of maximally general fuzzy rules for coverage of training examples from quantitative data. A rule is maximally general if no other rule exists that is both more general and with larger confidence than it. The proposed method first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set of linguistic terms using membership functions and then calculates the fuzzy lower approximations and the fuzzy upper approximations. The maximally general fuzzy rules are then generated based on these fuzzy approximations by an iterative induction process. The rules derived. can then be used to build a prototype knowledge base in a fuzzy expert system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, MG; Sclabassi, RJ				Sun, MG; Sclabassi, RJ			The forward EEG solutions can be computed using artificial neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						artificial neural network; efficient algorithm; efficient computation; EEG; electrostatic theory; forward problem; head geometry; head model; machine learning; partial differential equation; signal processing; source localization	VOLUME CONDUCTOR; HUMAN BRAIN; HEAD; LOCALIZATION; MODELS	Study of electroencenphalogarphy (EEG) is the one of the most utilized methods in both basic brain research and clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders. Recent technological advances in computer and electronic systems have allowed the EEG to be recorded from large electrode arrays. Modeling the brain waves using a head volume conductor model provides an effective method to localize functional generators within the brain. However, the forward solutions to this model, which represent theoretical potentials in response to current sources within the volume conductor, are difficult to compute because of time-consuming numerical procedures utilized in either the boundary element method (BEM) or the finite element method (FEM), This paper presents a novel computational approach using an artificial neural network (ANN) to map two vectors of forward solutions. These two vectors correspond to different head models but with respect to the same current source, The input vector to the ANN is based on the spherical head model, which can be computed efficiently but involves large errors. The output vector from the ANN is based on the spheroidal model, which is more precise, but difficult to compute directly using the traditional means, Our experiments indicate that this ANN approach provides a remarkable improvement over the BEM and FEM methods: 1) the mean-square error of computation was only approximately 0.3% compared to the exact solution; 2) the online computation was extremely efficient, requiring only 168 floating point operations per channel to compute the forward solution, and 10.2 K-bytes of storage to represent the entire ANN, Using this approach it is possible to perform real-time EEG modeling accurately on personal computers.

J	Oliver, NM; Rosario, B; Pentland, AP				Oliver, NM; Rosario, B; Pentland, AP			A Bayesian computer vision system for modeling human interactions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						visual surveillance; people detection; tracking; human behavior recognition; Hidden Markov Models		We describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in a visual surveillance task [1]. The system is particularly concerned with detecting when interactions between people occur and classifying the type of interaction. Examples of interesting interaction behaviors include following another person, altering one's path to meet another, and so forth. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information in a closed feedback loop, with both components employing a statistical Bayesian approach [2]. We propose and compare two different state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and CHMMs for modeling behaviors and interactions. The CHMM model is shown to work much more efficiently and accurately. Finally, to deal with the problem of limited training data, a synthetic "Alife-style" training system is used to develop flexible prior models for recognizing human interactions. We demonstrate the ability to use these a priori models to accurately classify real human behaviors and interactions with no additional tuning or training.

In this paper, we study the performance of a recently developed and improved classifier that integrates fuzzy set theory in a neural network (NEFCLASS). The performance of NEFCLASS is compared to a well-known classification technique from machine learning (C4.5). Both C4.5 and NEFCLASS will be evaluated on a collection of benchmarking data sets. Further, to boost performance of NEFCLASS, we investigate the advantage of preprocessing the algorithm by means of an exploratory factor analysis. We compare the algorithms before and after applying an exploratory factor analysis on leading performance indicators, as there are the accuracy of the created classifier and the magnitude of the associated rule base.

J	Schwenk, H; Bengio, Y				Schwenk, H; Bengio, Y			Boosting neural networks	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							ALGORITHMS	Boosting is a general method for improving the performance of learning algorithms. A recently proposed boosting algorithm, AdaBoost, has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using mainly decision trees as base classifiers. In this article we investigate whether AdaBoost also works as well with neural networks, and we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of different versions of the AdaBoost algorithm. In particular, we compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. The results suggest that random resampling of the training data is not the main explanation of the success of the improvements brought by AdaBoost. This is in contrast to bagging, which directly aims at reducing variance and for which random resampling is essential to obtain the reduction in generalization error. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data set of on-line handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. A boosted multilayer network achieved 1.5% error on the UCI letters and 8.1% error on the UCI satellite data set, which is significantly better than boosted decision trees.

J	Bengio, Y				Bengio, Y			Gradient-based optimization of hyperparameters	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								Many machine learning algorithms can be formulated as the minimization of a training criterion that involves a hyperparameter. This hyperparameter is usually chosen by trial and error with a model selection criterion. In this article we present a methodology to optimize several hyperparameters, based on the computation of the gradient of a model selection criterion with respect to the hyperparameters. In the case of a quadratic training criterion, the gradient of the selection criterion with respect to the hyperparameters is efficiently computed by backpropagating through a Cholesky decomposition. In the more general case, we show that the implicit function theorem can be used to derive a formula for the hyperparameter gradient involving second derivatives of the training criterion.

J	Amin, A				Amin, A			Recognition of printed arabic text based on global features and decision tree learning techniques	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						pattern recognition; printed Arabic text; connected component; skew detection and correction; global features; structural classification; machine learning C4.5; cross-validation	CHARACTER-RECOGNITION	Machine simulation of human reading has been the subject of intensive research for almost three decades. A large number of research papers and reports have already been published on Latin, Chinese and Japanese characters. However, little work has been conducted on the automatic recognition of Arabic in both on-line and off-line, has been achieved towards the automatic recognition of Arabic characters. This is a result of the lack of adequate support in terms of funding, and other utilities such as Arabic text databases, dictionaries, etc., and of course because of the cursive nature of its writing rules, and this problem is still an open research field. This paper presents a new technique for the recognition of Arabic text using the C4.5 machine learning system. The advantage of machine learning are twofold: it can generalize over the large degree of variations between different fonts and writing style and recognition rules can be constructed by examples. The technique can be divided into three major steps. The first step is digitization and pre-processing to create connected component, detect the skew of a document image and correct it. Second, feature extraction. where global features of the input Arabic word is used to extract features such as number of subwords, number of peaks within the subword, number and position of the complementary character etc., to avoid the difficulty of segmentation stage. Finally, machine learning C4.5 is used to generate a decision tree for classifying each word. The system was tested with 1000 Arabic words with different fonts (each word has 15 samples) and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 92%.

This paper gives a survey of algorithms, capable to derive interpretable models from toxicological data, and presents the most important application areas. The majority of techniques in this area were derived from symbolic machine learning, one commercial product was developed especially for toxicological applications. The main application area is presently the detection of structure--activity relationships, very few authors have used these techniques to solve problems in epidemiological and clinical toxicology. Although the discussed algorithms are very flexible and powerful, further research is required to adopt the algorithms to the specific learning problems in this area, to develop improved representations of chemical and biological data and to enhance the interpretability of the derived models for toxicological experts.

Decision tree inducer can directly extract reasonable operational rules from the data-set with no previous knowledge. By integrating the feature-subset selection wrapper algorithm, Naive-Bayes classifier and nearest-neighbor classifier can also estimate the action of operation successfully.

More recently, attention has turned to a variety of machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule induction (RI). This paper outlines some comparative research into the use of these three machine learning methods to build software effort prediction systems. We briefly describe each method and then apply the techniques to a dataset of 81 software projects derived from a Canadian software house in the late 1980s. We compare the prediction systems in terms of three factors: accuracy, explanatory value and configurability. We show that ANN methods have superior accuracy and that RI methods are least accurate. However, this view is somewhat counteracted by problems with explanatory value and configurability. For example, we found that considerable effort was required to configure the ANN and that this compared very unfavourably with the other techniques, particularly CBR and least squares regression (LSR). We suggest that Further work be carried out, both to further explore interaction between the end-user and the prediction system, and also to facilitate configuration, particularly of ANNs.

J	Gelosh, DS; Setliff, DE				Gelosh, DS; Setliff, DE			Modeling layout tools to derive forward estimates of area and delay at the RTL level	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						estimation; estimation techniques; layout; machine learning; VLSI CAD		Forward estimates of area and delay facilitate effective decision-making when searching the solution space of digital designs. Current estimation techniques focus on modeling the layout result and fail to deliver timely or accurate estimates. This paper presents a novel approach to deriving these area and delay estimates at the RTL level by modeling the layout tool, rather than the layout result. This approach uses machine learning techniques to capture the relationships between general design features (i.e., topology, connectivity, common input, and common output) and layout concepts (i.e., relative placement). Experiments illustrate the formulation of the training set for machine learning in this domain, and also show how we can derive different tool models. Finally, they show how we can use the resultant model to derive forward estimates of area and delay in real-world designs.

This task is important for enabling selective chemical monitoring of river water quality. We apply machine learning, in particular regression tree induction, to biological and chemical data on the water quality of Slovenian rivers. Regression trees are constructed that predict values of chemical parameters from data on the presence of bioindicator taxa at the species and family levels.

J	Sanguesa, R; Burrell, P				Sanguesa, R; Burrell, P			Application of Bayesian Network learning methods to Waste Water Treatment Plants	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Bayesian networks; machine learning; waste water treatment plants	INDEPENDENCE	Bayesian Networks have been proposed as an alternative to rule-based systems in domains with uncertainty. Applications in monitoring and control can benefit from this form of knowledge representation. Following the work of Chong and Walley, we explore the possibilities of Bayesian Networks in the Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTP) monitoring and control domain. We show the advantages of modelling knowledge in such a domain by means of Bayesian networks, put forth new methods for knowledge acquisition, describe their applications to a real waste water treatment plant and comment on the results. We also show how a Bayesian Network learning environment was used in the process and which characteristics of data in the domain suggested new ways of representing knowledge in network form but with uncertainty representations formalisms other than probability. The results of applying a possibilistic extension of current learning methods are also shown and compared.

J	Teller, A; Veloso, M				Teller, A; Veloso, M			Internal reinforcement in a connectionist genetic programming approach	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; evolutionary computation; genetic programming; signal understanding; internal reinforcement; neural programming; bucket brigade		Genetic programming (GP) can learn complex concepts by searching for the target concept through evolution of a population of candidate hypothesis programs. However, unlike some learning techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), GP does not have a principled procedure for changing parts of a learned structure based on that structure's performance on the training data. GP is missing a clear, locally optimal update procedure, the equivalent of gradient-descent backpropagation for ANNs. This article introduces a new algorithm, "internal reinforcement", for defining and using performance feedback on program evolution. This internal reinforcement principled mechanism is developed within a new connectionist representation for evolving parameterized programs, namely "neural programming". We present the algorithms for the generation of credit and blame assignment in the process of learning programs using neural programming and internal reinforcement. The article includes a comprehensive overview of genetic programming and empirical experiments that demonstrate the increased learning rate obtained by using our principled program evolution approach.

This study aimed to detect artifact patterns across multiple physiologic data signals from a neonatal ICU using decision tree induction. Approximately 200 h of bedside data were analyzed. Artifacts in the data streams were visually located and annotated retrospectively by an experienced clinician. Derived values were calculated for successively overlapping time intervals of raw values, and then used as feature attributes for the induction of models trying to classify 'artifact' versus 'not artifact' cases. The results are very promising, indicating that integration of multiple signals by applying a classification system to sets of values derived from physiologic data streams may be a viable approach to detecting artifacts in neonatal ICU data.

However, developing operational protocols is a highly complex and costly task. We present an integrated approach involving both intelligent data analysis and knowledge acquisition from experts that support the development of operational protocols. The aim is to ensure high quality standards for the protocol through empirical validation during the development, as well as lower development cost through the use of machine learning and statistical techniques. We demonstrate our approach of integrating expert knowledge with data driven techniques based on our effort to develop an operational protocol for the hemodynamic system.

Efficacy of an optimization approach is expressed in the accuracy of locating a global extremum, as well as in the number of investigated search points. The approach Machine Learning Optimization (ML-Opt), presented in this article, explores functional dependencies between search points in order to reduce the number of evaluations. Functional relations between search points are determined by an inductive learning algorithm, which generates a classifier used as a control structure in the optimization process. The classifier approximates the structure of the unknown goal function given by a simulation model and affects the generation of new search points. A discussion of a numerical example concludes the paper.

To complement SPC procedures, we suggest three integrated methods of inductive learning and neural networks for solving the quality problems. First, a feature subset selection method is proposed for reducing variables required for quality control. Second, a clustering inductive learning method is presented for improving the correct prediction rate (CPR) of inductive learning. Third, a pattern detection method is suggested for detection of different patterns comparing reference patterns. Three methods are experimented in two datasets. The results show that the three methods are effective for the multivariate process control. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Whigham, PA				Whigham, PA			Induction of a marsupial density model using genetic programming and spatial relationships	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						machine learning; spatial patterns; habitat prediction; genetic programming	ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS; CENTRAL HIGHLANDS; ASH FORESTS; HABITAT; TREES; SIZE	Machine learning techniques have been developed that allow the induction of spatial models for the prediction of habitat types and population distribution. However, most learning approaches are based on a propositional language for the development of models and therefore cannot express a wide range of possible spatial relationships that exist in the data. This paper compares the application of a functional evolutionary machine learning technique for prediction of marsupial density to some standard machine learning techniques. The ability of the learning system to express spatial relationships allows an improved predictive model to be developed, which is both parsimonious and understandable. Additionally, the maps produced from this approach have a generalised appearance of the measured glider density, suggesting that the underlying preferred habitat properties of the greater glider have been identified.

J	Wang, CH; Hong, TP; Chang, MB; Tseng, SS				Wang, CH; Hong, TP; Chang, MB; Tseng, SS			A coverage-based genetic knowledge-integration strategy	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						brain tumor diagnosis; genetic algorithm; knowledge encoding; knowledge integration; credit assignment	MULTIPLE EXPERTS; ACQUISITION; SYSTEMS; ALGORITHMS; RULES	In this paper, we propose a coverage-based genetic knowledge-integration approach to effectively integrate multiple rule sets into a centralized knowledge base. The proposed approach consists of two phases: knowledge encoding and knowledge integration. In the knowledge-encoding phase, each rule in the various rule sets that are derived from different sources (such as expert knowledge or existing knowledge bases) is first translated and encoded as a fixed-length bit string. The bit strings combined together thus form an initial knowledge population. In the knowledge-integration phase, a genetic algorithm applies genetic operations and credit assignment at each rule-string to generate an optimal or nearly optimal rule set. Experiments on diagnosing brain tumors were made to compare the accuracy of a rule set generated by the proposed approach with that of the initial rule sets derived from different groups of experts or induced by various machine learning techniques. Results show that the rule set derived by the proposed approach is more accurate than each initial rule set on its own. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wermter, S				Wermter, S			Neural network agents for learning semantic text classification	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						neural network; news agent; recurrent plausibility network; text classification; machine learning	RETRIEVAL	The research project AgNeT develops Agents For Neural Text routing in the internet. Unrestricted potentially faulty text messages arrive at a certain delivery point (e.g. email address: or world wide web address). These text messages are scanned and then distributed tu one of several expert agents according to a certain task criterium. Possible specific scenarios within this framework include the learning of the routing of publication titles ol news titles. In this paper we describe extensive experiments for semantic text rooting based on classified library titles and newswire titles. This task is challenging since incoming messages may contain constructions which have not been anticipated. Therefore, the contributions of this research are in learning and generalizing neural architectures for the robust interpretation of potentially noisy unrestricted messages. Neural networks were developed and examined for this topic since they support robustness and learning in noisy unrestricted real-world texts. We describe and compare different sets of experiments. The first set of experiments tests a recurrent neural network for the task of library title classification. Then we describe a larger more difficult newswire classification task from information retrieval. The comparison of the examined models demonstrates that techniques from information retrieval integrated into recurrent plausibility networks performed well even under noise and fur different corpora.

J	McCallum, AK; Nigam, K; Rennie, J; Seymore, K				McCallum, AK; Nigam, K; Rennie, J; Seymore, K			Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						spidering; crawling; reinforcement learning; information extraction; hidden Markov models; text classification; naive Bayes; expectation-maximization; unlabeled data		Domain-specific internet portals are growing in popularity because they gather content from the Web and organize it for easy access, retrieval and search. For example, www.campsearch.com allows complex queries by age location, cost and specialty over summer camps. This functionality is nor possible with general, Web-wide search engines. Unfortunately these portals are difficult and time-consuming to maintain. This paper advocates the use of machine learning techniques to greatly automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specific Internet portals. Ws describe new research in reinforcement learning, information extraction and text classification that enables efficient spidering, the identification of informative text segments, and the population of topic hierarchies. Using these techniques, we have built a demonstration system: a portal for computer science research papers. It already contains over 50,000 papers and is publicly available at www.cora.justresearch.com. These techniques are widely applicable to portal creation in other domains.

J	Bahler, D; Stone, B				Bahler, D; Stone, B			Symbolic, neural, and Bayesian machine learning models for predicting carcinogenicity of chemical compounds	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Mathematical Chemistry	MAY, 1999	DULUTH, MINNESOTA				NATIONAL-TOXICOLOGY-PROGRAM; RODENT CARCINOGENICITY; CLASSIFICATION; MUTAGENICITY; SYSTEMS	Experimental programs have been underway for several years to determine the environmental effects of chemical compounds, mixtures, and the like. Among these programs is the National Toxicology Program (NTP) on rodent carcinogenicity. Because these experiments are costly and time-consuming, the rate at which test articles (i.e., chemicals) can be tested is limited. The ability to predict the outcome of the analysis at various points in the process would facilitate informed decisions about the allocation of testing resources. To assist human experts in organizing an empirical testing regime, and to try to shed light on mechanisms of toxicity, we constructed toxicity models using various machine learning and data mining methods, both existing and those of our own devising. These models took the form of decision trees, rule sets, neural networks, rules extracted from trained neural networks, and Bayesian classifiers. As a training set, we used recent results from rodent carcinogenicity bioassays conducted by the NTP on 226 test articles. We performed 10-way cross-validation on each of our models to approximate their expected error rates on unseen data. The data set consists of physical-chemical parameters of test articles, alerting chemical substructures, salmonella mutagenicity assay results, subchronic histopathology data, and information on route, strain, and sex/species for 744 individual experiments. These results contribute to the ongoing process of evaluating and interpreting the data collected from chemical toxicity studies.

J	Fuchs, M				Fuchs, M			Proofs as schemas and their heuristic use	JOURNAL OF SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION			English	Article							CONDENSED DETACHMENT; AUTOMATED DEDUCTION	Automated theorem proving essentially amounts to solving search problems. Despite significant progress in recent years theorem provers still have many shortcomings. The use of machine-learning techniques such as schemas is acknowledged as promising, but difficult to apply in the area of theorem proving. We propose a simple form of schemes, and to make use of a schema heuristically by integrating it with a search-guiding heuristic. Experiments have demonstrated that the approach allows a theorem prover to find proofs significantly faster and to prove hard problems that were out of reach before. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Study design: Observational prospective study. Patients: 25 patients who presented acute respiratory distress syndrome and who were monitored with haemodynamic and respiratory monitoring. Methods: Each minute, a bedside clinical observer analysed alarms from the monitoring according to detection or absence to clinical events. Four situations were defined to statistical descriptive analysis: a) false positive (FP); b) true positive (TP); c) false negative (FN); and d) true negative (TN). True positive alarm which induced consequences on patients care were also analysed. Results: 15,013 minutes allowed the recordings of 3,665 alarms, 44% from arterial pressure, 17% from SpO(2) and 12% from airways maximal pressure. 46% were false positive alarms inducing a noisy pollution. The positive predictive value PPV = TP/(TP + FP) of these alarms were respectively 51% for arterial pressure, 18% for SpO(2) and 100% for Paw. Only 5% of true positive alarms induced consequences on patients care. Conclusion: This protocol allowed the evaluation of monitoring efficiency. This kind of evaluation may help to improve monitoring capacity with reducing noisy pollution from false positive alarms. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

J	Stone, P; Veloso, M				Stone, P; Veloso, M			Multiagent systems: A survey from a machine learning perspective	AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS			English	Review						multiagent systems; machine learning; survey; robotics; intelligent agents; robotic soccer; pursuit domain; homogeneous agents; heterogeneous agents; communicating agents	COMMUNICATION; ROBOTICS; TEAMWORK; SOCCER; AGENTS; ROLES; AI	Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfield of AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems that consist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain. Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focuses on the information management aspects of systems with several components working together towards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behavior management in collections of several independent entities, or agents. This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to the field and as an organizational framework. A series of general multiagent scenarios are presented. For each scenario, the issues that arise are described along with a sampling of the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presented techniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagent systems can be and have been used to build complex systems. When options exist, the techniques presented are biased towards machine learning approaches. Additional opportunities for applying machine learning to MAS are highlighted and robotic soccer is presented as an appropriate test bed for MAS. This survey does not focus exclusively on robotic systems. However, we believe that much of the prior research in non-robotic MAS is relevant to robotic MAS, and we explicitly discuss several robotic MAS, including all of those presented in this issue.

Extension matrix theory a branch of learning from examples, presents the training, examples as two matrices which consist of positive and negative examples respectively, and then find a path satisfied with a positive example against the background of negative examples. However, most of all of pattern recognition problems, such as handwritten Chinese character recognition, have overlapping area. It is necessary to solve the problem of non-linear boundaries among different classes when machine learning is applied to acquire the recognition rules. An advanced Extension Matrix algorithm is proposed in this paper, in which a heuristic search based on the average entropy is used to get the approximate solutions of the minimal complex, as well as a potential function is used to estimate the probability density function of the overlay area between positive and negative examples. so that the non-linear interfaces of the interclass areas may be obtained. This algorithm will be applied to supervised learning for Chinese character recognition to acquire recognition rules, and the implementations upon 751,000 loosely-constrained handwritten Chinese characters indicate that these methodologies have advantages of fast speed and on-line learning. and can be applied to a practical recognition system.

All of the previous systems, which have been developed to solve this problem, may be divided into two different categories, client-side, and server-side, from the view of location of filter. The former case always causes waste of network traffic and the latter case results that ail users may only share a small predefined set of filtering rules. In this paper, we propose a new architecture of E-mail service system, called Intelligent E-mail Service System (IESS), integrating client-side and server-side to help users manage their E-mails. A data mining approach is used in client to find managing rules from user's behavior of reading E-mail automatically. Then these rules would be stored in rule base for predicating E-mail at server. The prediction of the E-mail is made before transferring it to client; therefore, the undesired E-mails can be filtered at server to save network traffic. In addition, the feedback mechanism is provided to refine the prediction accuracy based on each user's decisions for reading E-mails. Experimental results show that IESS can infer E-mail reading preference of individual users correctly up to the accuracy about 80%. We may conclude that IESS can help users manage their E-mails effectively.

Unfortunately, the choice of suitable expressions and the tuning of their parameters is particularly difficult in dynamic conditions. In this paper we introduce a hybrid modeling technique which allows us to preserve the most important features of an accurate distributed parameter TWC model, while it circumvents both the structural and the parameter uncertainties of "classical" reaction kinetics models, and saves computational time. In particular, we compute the rates within the TWC dynamic model by a neural network which, thus, becomes a static nonlinear component of a larger dynamic system. A purposely designed genetic algorithm, in conjunction with a fast ad hoc partial differential equation integration procedure, allows us to train the neural network, embedded in the whole model structure, using currently available measurement data and without computing gradient information.

The BCI system could train users to control an animated cursor on the computer screen by voluntary electroencephalogram (EEG) modulation. Our BCI system requires only two to four electrodes, and has a relatively short training time for both the user and the machine. Moving the cursor in one dimension, our subjects were able to hit 100% of randomly selected targets, while in two dimensions, accuracies of approximately 63% and 76% was achieved with our two subjects.

In many cases, such knowledge is given in the forms of constraints on differential data or more specifically partial differential equations (FDEs). Neural networks with capabilities to learn differential data can take advantage of such knowledge and easily incorporate such constraints into the learning of training value data. In this paper, we report a structure, an algorithm, and results of experiments on neural networks learning differential data.

Data mining also called as data or knowledge discovery is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information. Data mining software is one of a number of analytical tools for analyzing data It allows users to analyze data from many different dimensions or angles, categorize it, and summarizes the relationships identified. Pattern classification is one particular category of data mining, which enables the discovery of knowledge from very large databases (VLDB). Data mining can be applied to a wide range of applications such as business forecasting, decision support systems, SONAR, RADAR, SEISMIC and medical diagnosis. Artificial neural networks are used to mine the database which has better noise immunity and lesser training time. A self-organizing neural network architecture called predictive ART or ARTMAP is introduced that is capable of fast stable learning, hypothesis testing in response to arbitrary stream of input patterns. A generalization of binary ARTMAP is the fuzzy ARTMAP, which learns to classify input by a pattern of fuzzy membership values between 0 and 1, indicating the extent to which each feature is present. Generalization of fuzzy ARTMAP is the Cascade ARTMAP which has pre-existing symbolic rules that are used to initialize the network before learning so that the network efficiency is increased. This rule insertion also provides knowledge to the network that cannot be captured by training examples. Interpretation of knowledge learned by this neural network leads to compact and simpler rules compared to Back propagation approach. Another self-organizing algorithm is proposed using Kohonen Architecture which also requires lesser time and high prediction accuracy compared to BPN. Moreover, the rules extracted from this network are very simple compared to BPN approach. Finally, the extracted rules have been validated for their correctness. This approach is most widely used in the Medical Industry for correct prediction when the database is large in size. At this time, the manual mining on such a voluminous data is very difficult and also a very time consuming process. Sometimes it may lead to incorrect predictions. Henceforth, the data mining software is developed. The performance evaluation of all three networks namely, Cascade ARTMAP, Fuzzy ARTMAP and Kohonen have been done and compared with conventional methods. Simulation is carried out using the medical data bases taken from the UCI repository of machine learning data bases. The developed data mining software can also be used for other applications like Web, communications, and pattern recognition.

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system.

MikeTalk is built using visemes, which are a small set of images spanning a large range of mouth shapes. The visemes are acquired from a recorded visual corpus of a human subject which is specifically designed to elicit one instantiation of each viseme. Using optical flow methods, correspondence from every viseme to every other viseme is computed automatically. By morphing along this correspondence, a smooth transition between viseme images may be generated. A complete visual utterance is constructed by concatenating viseme transitions. Finally, phoneme and timing information extracted from a text-to-speech synthesizer is exploited to determine which viseme transitions to use, and the rate at which the morphing process should occur. In this manner, we are able to synchronize the visual speech stream with the audio speech stream, and hence give the impression of a photorealistic talking face.

J	Guvenir, HA; Uysal, I				Guvenir, HA; Uysal, I			Regression on feature projections	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						regression; function approximation; feature projections	CLASSIFICATION	This paper describes a machine learning method, called Regression on Feature Projections (RFP), for predicting a real-valued target feature, given the values of multiple predictive features. In RFP training is based on simply storing the projections of the training instances on each feature separately. Prediction of the target value for a query point is obtained through two averaging procedures executed sequentially. The first averaging process is to find the individual predictions of features by using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The second averaging process combines the predictions of all features. During the first averaging step, each feature is associated with a weight in order to determine the prediction ability of the feature at the local query point. The weights, found for each local query point, are used in the second prediction step and enforce the method to have an adaptive or context-sensitive nature. We have compared RFP with KNN and the rule based-regression algorithms. Results on real data sets show that RFP achieves better or comparable accuracy and is faster than both KNN and Rule-based regression algorithms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For one system, the clusters were located at the belt and AFO. In the other system, the clusters were located at the AFO and the thigh. The maximum cluster size was 14 cm(3) and 75 g. The clusters of each sensor system were interconnected by a single flexible wire bus, which minimized the effects of cabling. The sensors detected five phases of normal gait to a resolution of 40 ms in an able bodied test. Using a threshold method, the sensor system repeatedly predicted an incipient knee buckle in a paraplegic individual by a minimum of 30 ms. One system detected knee flexion angle analytically to an accuracy of 3.2 degrees during sit to stand trials. The second system determined knee and hip flexion angle to an accuracy of 3.8 degrees during sit to stand trials through neural networks. The signal processing of the acquired sensor signals in each system was performed on a MC68332 microcomputer in conjunction with the data sampling, and suggested the possibility for each sensor system to be used in real time control of FES.

J	Sidani, TA; Gonzalez, AJ				Sidani, TA; Gonzalez, AJ			A framework for learning implicit expert knowledge through observation	TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR COMPUTER SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						machine learning; automated knowledge acquisition; intelligent simulations	ARCHITECTURE	This paper describes a framework for automatically learning implicit knowledge by non-intrusively observing the behavior of a human expel? in a simulation of the tasks to be reproduced by the autonomous system. There are several limiting factors presently constraining the development of a truly intelligent and autonomous machine. The most significant of these is that acquiring expert knowledge continues to be a difficult and time-consuming process. Automated knowledge acquisition techniques have been partially successful in reducing the effort involved in acquiring knowledge from an expert and representing it ill a form that can be used by the computer. Most of these techniques, however; focus on the gathering and representation of explicit knowledge. This type of expertise, which includes facts, formulas and rules, makes up most Of the expert's knowledge and is relatively easy to articulate. There is a second type of expertise called implicit (or tacit) knowledge, which includes the more abstract forms of intuition and judgment and is much more difficult to articulate and represent. One way humans learn implicit knowledge is by observing others handle real-life situations and by adapting what we have observed to handle new situations. Current approaches largely only address explicit knowledge via query sessions and ignore the implicit expertise altogether Humans, on the other hand, continually learn and apply both types of knowledge. Yet, intelligent autonomous systems that can operate in an unfamiliar environment require rite representation of both types of knowledge. Building machines that can reason and behave in a manner similar to a human expert requires formulating an approach for capturing and representing the implicit knowledge that is commonly applied by experts. A framework capable of learning implicit knowledge via non-intrusive observation is designed and implemented as a prototype and is rigorously tested and evaluated. This article describes this effort and draws conclusions from the investigation.

Economic software agents will differ in important ways from their human counterparts, and these differences may have significant beneficial or harmful effects upon the global economy. It is therefore important to consider the economic incentives and behaviors of economic software agents, and to use every available means to anticipate their collective interactions. We survey research conducted by the Information Economies group at IBM Research aimed at understanding collective interactions among agents that dynamically price information goods or services. In particular, we study the potential impact of widespread shopbot usage on prices, the price dynamics that may ensue from various mixtures of automated pricing agents (or "pricebots"), the potential use of machine-learning algorithms to improve profits, and more generally the interplay among learning, optimization, and dynamics in agent-based information economies. These studies illustrate both beneficial and harmful collective behaviors that can arise in such systems, suggest possible cures for some of the undesired phenomena, and raise fundamental theoretical issues, particularly in the realms of multi-agent learning and dynamic optimization.

J	Dalaka, A; Kompare, B; Robnik-Sikonja, M; Sgardelis, SP				Dalaka, A; Kompare, B; Robnik-Sikonja, M; Sgardelis, SP			Modelling the effects of environmental conditions on apparent photosynthesis of Stipa bromoides by machine learning tools	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						automatic model construction; machine learning; regression trees; P-I curves	PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; LIGHT; PHOTOINHIBITION; CONSTRUCTION; PLANTS; LEAVES; LEAF; SUN; CO2	Apparent leaf photosynthesis of the grass Stipa bromoides was measured in the field in two sites of Northern Greece. For predicting apparent photosynthesis from irradiance, temperature and relative air humidity data, we applied and compared two modelling approaches: ordinary statistical modelling and automatic model construction based on machine learning procedures. Ordinary statistical models were constructed based on background knowledge concerning the response of photosynthesis to irradiance. A Michaelis-Menten type light saturation curve was selected among six candidate models and was extended to include air temperature effects. A bell-shaped function of temperature was substituted for the parameter describing the asymptotic maximum photosynthesis. The final model accounted for 67.3% of data variation and was further improved by splitting the data set by experimental site. Site-specific differences were detected regarding the half saturation constant for light and the optimal temperature for photosynthesis. Automatic model construction produced a number of regression trees that enabled a detailed but simple description of the way irradiance, temperature and relative humidity affect photosynthesis. Photosynthesis increases with increasing irradiance, temperature affects photosynthesis when irradiance is close to saturation levels and relative humidity has an effect when both irradiance and temperature are high. There is a threshold value of relative humidity (at about 35%), below which photosynthesis is independent of irradiance within the observed range, decreasing with increasing temperature when temperature is high (> 25 degrees C) and increasing with increasing relative humidity when temperature is low (< 25 degrees C). The machine learning tools we used provide a very powerful modelling alternative to ordinary curve fitting methods. Their major advantages are the flexibility to select between accuracy and generality and their robustness against outliers and mixtures of differential responses. The models are transparent and easily interpreted. They seem to be able to handle quite complex dependencies among attributes, not requiring prior expert knowledge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Fuzzy ID3 and its variants are popular and efficient methods of making fuzzy decision trees from a group of training examples. This paper points out the inherent defect of the likes of Fuzzy ID3, presents two optimization principles of fuzzy decision trees, proves that the algorithm complexity of constructing a kind of minimum fuzzy decision tree is NP-hard, and gives a new algorithm which is applied to three practical problems. The experimental results show that, with regard to the size of trees and the classification accuracy for unknown cases, the new algorithm is superior to the likes of Fuzzy ID3.

J	Hong, TP; Chen, JB				Hong, TP; Chen, JB			Processing individual fuzzy attributes for fuzzy rule induction	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision table; fuzzy if-then rule; membership function; relevant attribute; knowledge acquisition; machine learning	CLASSIFICATION; EXAMPLES	Fuzzy systems that can automatically derive fuzzy if-then rules and membership functions from numeric data have recently been developed. In this paper, we propose two new fuzzy learning methods for automatically deriving membership functions and fuzzy if-then rules from a set of given training examples. The proposed methods first select relevant attributes and build appropriate initial membership functions. They then simplify the intervals and the membership functions of each attribute before forming a decision table. These attributes and membership functions are then used in a decision table to derive the final fuzzy if-then rules and membership functions. Experimental results for the Iris data show that our methods can achieve a high degree of accuracy. The proposed methods are thus useful in constructing membership functions and in managing uncertainty and vagueness. They can also reduce the time and effort needed to develop a fuzzy knowledge base.

J	Wang, CH; Hong, TP; Tseng, SS				Wang, CH; Hong, TP; Tseng, SS			Integrating membership functions and fuzzy rule sets from multiple knowledge sources	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						expert systems; fuzzy machine learning; fuzzy sets; knowledge acquisition; membership functions; operators	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; EXPERTS; ACQUISITION; SYSTEM	Ln this paper, we propose a GA-based fuzzy knowledge-integration framework that can simultaneously integrate multiple fuzzy rule sets and their membership function sets. The proposed two-phase approach includes fuzzy knowledge encoding and fuzzy knowledge integration. In the encoding phase, each fuzzy rule set with its associated membership functions is first transformed into an intermediary representation, and further encoded as a string. The combined strings form an initial knowledge population which is then ready for integration. In the knowledge-integration phase. a genetic algorithm is used to generate an optimal or nearly optimal set of fuzzy rules and membership functions from the initial knowledge population. The hepatitis diagnostic problem was used to show the performance of the proposed knowledge-integration approach. Results show that the fuzzy knowledge-base resulting from using our approach performs better than every individual knowledge base. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shin, CK; Yun, UT; Kim, HK; Park, SC				Shin, CK; Yun, UT; Kim, HK; Park, SC			A hybrid approach of neural network and memory-based learning to data mining	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; memory-based reasoning; neural network	ALGORITHMS; SYSTEM	We propose a hybrid prediction system of neural network and memory-based learning. Neural network (NN) and memory-based reasoning (MBR) are frequently applied to data mining with various objectives. They have common advantages over other learning strategies, NN and MBR can be directly applied to classification and regression without additional transformation mechanisms. They also have strength in learning the dynamic behavior of the system over a period of time. Unfortunately, they have shortcomings when applied to data mining tasks. Though the neural network is considered as one of the most powerful and universal predictors, the knowledge representation of NN is unreadable to humans, and this "black box" property restricts the application of NN to data mining problems, which require proper explanations for the prediction. On the other hand, MBR suffers from the feature-weighting problem. When MBR measures the distance between cases, some input features should be treated as more important than other features. Feature weighting should be executed prior to prediction in order to provide the information on the feature importance. In our hybrid system of NN and MBR, the feature weight set, which is calculated from the trained neural network, plays the core role in connecting both learning strategies, and the explanation for prediction can be given by obtaining and presenting the most similar examples from the case base. Moreover, the proposed system has advantages in the typical data mining problems such as scalability to large datasets, high dimensions, and adaptability to dynamic situations, Experimental results show that the hybrid system has a high potential in solving data mining problems.

J	Fu, LM; Shortliffe, EH				Fu, LM; Shortliffe, EH			The application of certainty factors to neural computing for rule discovery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						certainty factor; domain rule; knowledge discovery; machine learning; neural network; uncertainty management	NETWORKS	Discovery of domain principles has been a major long-term goal for scientists. This paper presents a new system named DOMRUL for learning such principles in the form of rules. A distinctive feature of the system is the integration of the certainty factor (CF) model and a neural network. These two elements complement each other. The CF model offers the neural network better semantics and generalization advantage, and the neural network overcomes possible limitations such as inaccuracies and overcounting of evidence associated with certainty factors. It is a major contribution of this paper to show mathematically the quantizability nature of the CFNet since previously the quantizability of the CF model was demonstrated only empirically. The rule discovery system can be applied to any domain without restriction on both the rule number and rule size, In a hypothetical domain, DOMRUL discovered complex domain rules at a considerably higher accuracy than a commonly used rule-learning program C4.5 in both normal and noisy conditions, The scalability in a large domain is also shown. On a real data set concerning promoters prediction in molecular biology, DOMRUL learned rules with more complete semantics than C4.5.

To maintain profitability, wireless carriers must control churn, which is the loss of subscribers who switch from one carrier to another, We explore techniques from statistical machine learning to predict churn and, based on these predictions, to determine what incentives should be offered to subscribers to improve retention and maximize profitability to the carrier. The techniques include legit regression, decision trees, neural networks, and boosting. Our experiments are based on a database of nearly 47 000 U.S. domestic subscribers and includes information about their usage, billing, credit, application, and complaint history. Our experiments show that under a wide variety of assumptions concerning the cost of intervention and the retention rate resulting from intervention, using predictive techniques to identify potential churners and offering incentives can yield significant savings to a carrier. We also show the importance of a data representation crafted by domain experts. Finally, we report on a real-world test of the techniques that validate our simulation experiments.

Conventional methods have relied on manually constructed dictionaries which are not only tedious to construct but also difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over a large degree of variation between writing styles, and recognition rules can be constructed by example. Characters are scanned into the computer and preprocessing techniques transform the bit-map representation of the characters into a set of primitives which can be represented in an attribute base form. A set of such representations for each character is then input to C4.5 which produces a decision tree for classifying each character.

Biochemical studies in laryngeal cancer have shown a potential prognostic significance of cathepsin D content determination. We studied immunohistochemical positivity of cathepsin D in tumor epithelium and stroma of 61 surgical specimens of squamous cell laryngeal cancer. Immunohistochemical reaction was quantitatively assessed using a PC-based image analysis system SFORM-VAMS. The results were correlated to clinical and morphological parameters and survival. Immunohistochemical positivity was noted in neoplastic cells and tumor stroma. Significant prognostic value for cathepsin D was established separately for epithelial tumor component and tumor stroma using log-rank test, the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and C4.5 machine learning system. In all groups, patients above the median cathepsin D staining showed significantly shorter survival time. C4.5 machine learning system extracted cutoff values for the decision tree that defines the probabilities of patients survival and death with high sensitivity (92.8% alive, 73.6% dead), 100% specificity, and 86.9% accuracy. This makes immunohistochemical cathepsin D estimation an independent prognostic parameter in laryngeal carcinomas within a 5-year period from the time of tumor surgery.

All patients received neuropsychological evaluation for establishing the research diagnoses. A data mining program that used machine learning algorithms produced an optimized binary decision tl ee for differentiating patient groups according to all available information. The results of this analysis were used to help foul. dementia experts create a dementia screening instrument amenable to application and scoring by nonclinical personnel. The validity of the resulting instrument was then evaluated in an independent sample of 103 patients administered neuropsychological testing within the previous 60 days. The psychometric properties of the empirically derived scale and its performance for discriminating control from probable or possible, Alzheimer's patients indicate strong potential for use as a dementia screener for the general population.

By running the neural networks in parallel, we confirm that accuracy to detect system changes is good, and the adjustment of classifier parameters is relatively easy. Investigating the resulting classes carefully, frequency of each class is correlated with pump efficiency. The relative amount of variables are also related to the classes.

J	Freitag, D				Freitag, D			Machine learning for information extraction in informal domains	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						information extraction; multistrategy learning	CLASSIFICATION	We consider the problem of learning to perform information extraction in domains where linguistic processing is problematic, such as Usenet posts, email, and finger plan files. In place of syntactic and semantic information, other sources of information can be used, such as term frequency, typography, formatting, and mark-up. We describe four learning approaches to this problem, each drawn from a different paradigm: a rote learner, a term-space learner based on Naive Bayes, an approach using grammatical induction, and a relational rule learner. Experiments on 14 information extraction problems defined over four diverse document collections demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches. Finally, we describe a multistrategy approach which combines these learners and yields performance competitive with or better than the best of them. This technique is modular and flexible, and could find application in other machine learning problems.

These InfoSpiders browse networked information environments on-line in search of pages relevant to the user, by traversing hyperlinks in an autonomous and intelligent fashion. Each agent adapts to the spatial and temporal regularities of its local context thanks to a combination of machine learning techniques inspired by ecological models: evolutionary adaptation with local selection, reinforcement learning and selective query expansion by internalization of environmental signals, and optional relevance feedback. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of these methods in three domains: a general class of artificial graph environments, a controlled subset of the Web, and (preliminarly) the full Web. Our results suggest that InfoSpiders could take advantage of the starting points provided by search engines, based on global word statistics, and then use linkage topology to guide their search on-line. We show how this approach can complement the current state of the art, especially with respect to the scalability challenge.

In Study 1, standard machine learning techniques were used to create a decision tree that could be used to classify 8124 different mushrooms as being edible or poisonous on the basis of 21 different Features (Schlimmer, 1987). In Study 2, extra output learning was used to insert this decision tree into a PDP network being trained on the identical problem. An interpretation of the trained network revealed a perfect mapping from its internal structure to the decision tree, representing a precise translation of the classical theory to the connectionist model. In Study 3, a second network was trained on the mushroom problem without using extra output learning. An interpretation of this second network revealed a different algorithm for solving the mushroom problem, demonstrating that the Study 2 network was indeed a proper theory translation.

This presents novel challenges and problems, distinct from those typically arising in the allied areas of statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition or database science. A distinction is drawn between the two data mining activities of model building and pattern detection. Even though statisticians are familiar with the former, the large data sets involved in data mining mean that novel problems do arise. The second of the activities, pattern detection, presents entirely new classes of challenges, some arising, again, as a consequence of the large sizes of the data sets. Data quality is a particularly troublesome issue in data mining applications, and this is examined. The discussion is illustrated with a variety of real examples.

J	Pereira, F				Pereira, F			Formal grammar and information theory: together again?	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						formal linguistics; information theory; machine learning	ALGORITHM; AUTOMATA	In the last 40 years, research on models of spoken and written language has been split between two seemingly irreconcilable traditions: formal linguistics in the Chomsky tradition, and information theory in the Shannon tradition. Zellig Harris had advocated a close alliance between grammatical and information-theoretic principles in the analysis of natural language, and early formal-language theory provided another strong link between information theory and linguistics. Nevertheless, in most research on language and computation, grammatical and information-theoretic approaches had moved far apart. Today, after many years on the defensive, the information-theoretic approach has gained new strength and achieved practical successes in speech recognition, information retrieval, and, increasingly, in language analysis and machine translation. The exponential increase in the speed and storage capacity of computers is the proximate cause of these engineering successes, allowing the automatic estimation of the parameters of probabilistic models of language by counting occurrences of linguistic events in very large bodies of text and speech. However, I will argue that information-theoretic and computational ideas are also playing an increasing role in the scientific understanding of language, and will help bring together formal-linguistic and information-theoretic perspectives.

STUDY DESIGN: The performance of four automatic learning algorithms, representing current machine learning technology, were assessed using four methodologies in the task of separating normal squamous inter mediate cervical cells from ail other segmented objects in digital images. Two Of the methodologies were carefully constructed to model sources of variation associated with the choice of training and test sets. These assessments were statistically compared with assessments using both standard and a modified version of cross-validation. RESULTS: The investigation illustrates the tradeoffs involved in obtaining statistical rigor as compared with the cost of collecting data. While cross-validation makes frugal use of data, if can produce misleading assessments of algorithm performance in terms of both bias and variance. The modified version produces more reliable assessments but in some cases may also be misleading. CONCLUSION: We suggest that users of learning algorithms should exercise judicious care in evaluating learning algorithm performance in order to avoid unnecessary bias and large variance in their assessments.

J	Friedman, J; Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R				Friedman, J; Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R			Additive logistic regression: A statistical view of boosting	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						classification; tree; nonparametric estimation; stagewise fitting; machine learning	CLASSIFICATION	Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted Versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.

J	Kushmerick, N				Kushmerick, N			Wrapper induction: Efficiency and expressiveness	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						information extraction; wrapper induction; machine learning; internet information integration; information agents	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; INTERNET	The Internet presents numerous sources of useful information-telephone directories, product catalogs, stock quotes, event listings, etc. Recently, many systems have been built that automatically gather and manipulate such information on a user's behalf. However, these resources are usually formatted for use by people (e.g., the relevant content is embedded in HTML pages), so extracting their content is difficult. Most systems use customized wrapper procedures to perform this extraction task. Unfortunately, writing wrappers is tedious and error-prone. As an alternative, we advocate wrapper induction, a technique for automatically constructing wrappers. In this article, we describe six wrapper classes, and use a combination of empirical and analytical techniques to evaluate the computational tradeoffs among them. We first consider expressiveness: how well the classes can handle actual Internet resources, and the extent to which wrappers in one class can mimic those in another. We then turn to efficiency: we measure the number of examples and time required to learn wrappers in each class, and we compare these results to PAC models of our task and asymptotic complexity analyses of our algorithms. Summarizing our results, we find that most of our wrapper classes are reasonably useful (70% of surveyed sites can be handled in total), yet can rapidly learned (learning usually requires just a handful of examples and a fraction of a CPU second per example).

The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs. The first is an ontology that defines the classes (e.g,, company, person, employee, product) and relations (e.g., employed by, produced by) of interest when creating the knowledge base. The second is a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext that represent instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This article describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system that has created a knowledge base describing university people, courses, and research projects.

The learning system determines a separate set of control parameter values, for optimal performance under given operating conditions, and stores them in memory. In this way, the controller is able to operate effectively over the whole environment. The basic scheme implements a single neuron, the perceptron, which approximates the process model and then directly computes the control signals. An example application is also described of an innovative sensing method, which has been developed to replace leaf sensors in plant propagation chambers, by emulating the sensor in software. Such chambers present critical situations for control because of the high humidity levels required, which makes direct sensing methods unsuitable. The proposed method enhanced the reliability of the control system and eliminated the need for costly electronic leaf sensors and the associated need for great care and frequent calibration. The method in principle combines ordinary measurements of ambient temperature, humidity and radiation, to calculate the controls of the humidification process in mist or fog propagation chambers. The performance surface was studied and a modification of the searching algorithm has improved the learning rate significantly. The method is applicable to any system whose performance can be defined and measured by simulation or experiment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This algorithm supports a useful degree of conditional branching while minimizing the training data fragmentation typical of decision trees. Classifications are based on a rich set of collocational, morphological and syntactic contextual features, extracted automatically from training data and weighted sensitive to the nature of the feature and feature class. The algorithm is evaluated comprehensively in the SENSEVAL framework, achieving the top performance of all participating supervised systems on the 36 test words where training data is available.

J	Gahegan, M				Gahegan, M			On the application of inductive machine learning tools to geographical analysis	GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							REMOTE-SENSING DATA; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SENSED DATA; CLASSIFICATION; MULTISOURCE; ACCURACY; BACKPROPAGATION; MODELS	Inductive machine learning tools, such as neural networks and decision trees, offer alternative methods for classification, clustering, and pattern recognition that can, in theory, extend to the complex or "deep" data sets that pervade geography. By contrast, traditional statistical approaches may fail, due to issues of scalability and flexibility. This paper discusses the role of inductive machine learning as it relates to geographical analysis. The discussion presented is not based on comparative results or on mathematical description, but instead focuses on the often subtle ways in which the carious inductive learning approaches differ operationally, describing (1) the manner in which the feature space is partitioned or clustered, (2) the search mechanisms employed to identify good solutions, and (3) the different biases that each technique imposes. consequences arising from these issues, when considering complex geographic feature spaces, are then described in detail. The overall ale is to provide a foundation upon which reliable inductive analysis methods can be constructed, instead of depending on piecemeal or haphazard experimentation with the various operational criteria that inductive learning tools call for. Often, it would appear that these criteria are not well understood by practitioners in the geographic sphere, which can lead to difficulties in configuration and operation, and ultimate by to poor performance.

Exploration of the search space is made by resorting to some quality measure of prospective solutions. This measure is usually based on statistical assumptions. We discuss the interest of adopting a different point of view closer to machine learning techniques. Our main point is the convenience of using prior knowledge when it is available. We identify several sources of prior knowledge and define their role in the learning process. Their relation to measures of quality used in the learning of possibilistic networks are explained and some preliminary steps for adapting previous algorithms under these new assumptions are presented.

The application is designed as an assistant, rather than as an automatic system that intervenes directly in the operator/plant loop. The application is required to handle vague and numerically imprecise background information in the construction of classifier committees. A classifier committee (or ensemble) is a classifier created by combining the predictions of multiple sub-classifiers. The presented method combines classifiers into a committee by using computational methods for decision analysis that are designed to work when the information at hand is imprecise. The application evaluates and make priorities between classified alarms according to credibilities that depend on the current context. Machine learning techniques are used to construct classifiers that recognize various malfunctions in a process, determine whether a situation is normal or not, and make priorities among alarms.

The learning process is supervised and obtains a language model oriented to resolve POS ambiguities, consisting of a set of statistical decision trees expressing distribution of tags and words in some relevant contexts. The acquired decision trees have been directly used in a tagger that is both relatively simple and fast, and which has been tested and evaluated on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus with competitive accuracy. However, better results can be obtained by translating the trees into rules to feed a flexible relaxation labeling based tagger. In this direction we describe a tagger which is able to use information of any kind (n-grams, automatically acquired constraints, linguistically motivated manually written constraints, etc.), and in particular to incorporate the machine-learned decision trees. Simultaneously, we address the problem of tagging when only limited training material is available, which is crucial in any process of constructing, from scratch, an annotated corpus. We show that high levels of accuracy can be achieved with our system in this situation, and report some results obtained when using it to develop a 5.5 million words Spanish corpus from scratch.

J	Jevsnik, S				Jevsnik, S			Predicting mechanical properties of fused panel	FIBRES & TEXTILES IN EASTERN EUROPE			English	Article						fusible interlining; fused panel; mechanical properties; clothing engineering; machine learning		It is well known how important is the influence of fusible interlining on the appearance of produced garments. On the basis of mechanical properties such as extensibility, formability bending, and shear rigidity if is possible to make decisions which affect the aesthetic and functional requirements of garments. The mechanical properties of the fused panels are dependent on the interaction between the shell fabric and fusible interlining as well as on the fusing parameters selected The use of machine learning from examples in order to predict the mechanical properties of the fused panel is presented. Each analysed mechanical property has ifs own learning set and the construct classification rules are described in the form of regression trees in graphical and textual form. The mechanical properties of new examples of fused panels obtained using the constructed rules are verified with experimentally measured samples.

More precisely, we provide a diagnostic model that discriminate between cerebellum-pontine angle (CPA) tumors and otorhinolaryngological (ENT) disorders. Usually in order to distinguish between CPA tumors and ENT disorders one must perform clinical-neurological examination together with expensive radiological imagery (CT and MRI). The proposed model was obtained through artificial intelligence methods and presented a good accuracy level (88.4%) when tested against new cases, considering only clinical examination without radiological imagery results.

If such features were available, a proper learning system could be trained to distinguish images of different kinds of objects, starting from a set of labeled examples. In this paper we show that fractal features obtained from Iterated Function System encodings capture the kind of information that is needed by learning systems and, thus, allow the successful classification of 2-dimensional images of objects. We also present a fractal feature extraction algorithm and report the classification results obtained on two very different test-beds by applying Machine Learning techniques to sets of encoded images.

The key features of the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) are the discovery of minimal sets of features necessary for explaining all observations and the detection of hidden patterns in the data capable of distinguishing observations describing "positive" outcome events from "negative" outcome events. Combinations of such patterns are used for developing general classification procedures. An implementation of this methodology is described in the paper along with the results of numerical experiments demonstrating the classification performance of LAD in comparison with the reported results of other procedures. In the final section, we describe three pilot studies on applications of LAD to oil exploration, psychometric testing, and the analysis of developments in the Chinese transitional economy. These pilot studies demonstrate not only the classification power of LAD, but also its flexibility and capability to provide solutions to various case-dependent problems.

Neural networks have been used as an effective alternative for estimating input-output probabilities. In this paper, the certainty-factor-based neural network (CFNet) is explored for probability estimation in discrete domains. A new analysis presented here shows that the basis functions learned by the CFNet can bear precise semantics for dependencies. In the simulation study, the CFNet outperforms both the backpropagation network and the system based on the Rademacher-Walsh expansion. In the real-data experiments on splice junction and breast cancer data sets, the CFNet outperforms other neural networks and symbolic systems.

J	Kalanovic, VD; Popovic, D; Skaug, NT				Kalanovic, VD; Popovic, D; Skaug, NT			Feedback error learning neural network for trans-femoral prosthesis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							ABOVE-KNEE PROSTHESIS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION SYSTEMS; LOCOMOTION; MODEL; WALKING; GAIT	Feedback-error learning (FEL) neural network was developed for control of a powered trans-femoral prosthesis. Nonlinearities and time-variations of the dynamics of the plant, in addition to redundancy and dynamic uncertainty during the double support phase of walking, makes conventional control methods very difficult to use. Rule-based control, which uses a knowledge base determined by machine learning and finite automata method is limited since it does not respond well to perturbations and environmental changes. FEL can be regarded as a hybrid control, because it combines nonparametric identification with parametric modeling and control. This paper presents simulation of a powered trans-femoral prosthesis controlled by a FEL neural network. Results suggest that FEL can be used to identify inverse dynamics of an arbitrary trans-femoral prosthesis during simple single joint movements (e.g., sinusoidal oscillations). The identified inverse dynamics then allows the tracking of an arbitrary trajectory such as a desired walking pattern within a multijoint structure, Simulation shows that the identified controller responds correctly when the Leg motion is exposed to a perturbation such as a frequent change of the ground reaction force or the hip joint torque generated by the user. FEL eliminates the need for precise, tedious, and complex identification of model parameters.

In intelligent systems for paper document processing this information capture process is based on knowledge of the specific layout and logical structures of the documents. This article proposes the application of machine learning techniques to acquire the specific knowledge required by an intelligent document processing system, named WISDOM++, that manages printed documents, such as letters and journals. Knowledge is represented by means of decision trees and first-order rules automatically generated from a set of training documents. In particular, an incremental decision tree learning system is applied for the acquisition of decision trees used for the classification of segmented blocks, while a first-order learning system is applied for the induction of rules used for the layout-based classification and understanding of documents. Issues concerning the incremental induction of decision trees and the handling of both numeric and symbolic data in first-order rule learning are discussed, and the validity of the proposed solutions is empirically evaluated by processing a set of real printed documents.

J	Kaufman, KA; Michalski, RS				Kaufman, KA; Michalski, RS			An adjustable description quality measure for pattern discovery using the AQ methodology	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; data mining; learning from noisy data; natural induction; AQ learning; decision rules; separate and conquer		In concept learning and data mining tasks, the learner is typically faced with a choice of many possible hypotheses or patterns characterizing the input data. If one can assume that training data contain no noise, then the primary conditions a hypothesis must satisfy are consistency and completeness with regard to the data. In real-world applications, however, data are often noisy, and the insistence on the full completeness and consistency of the hypothesis is no longer valid. In such situations, the problem is to determine a hypothesis that represents the best trade-off between completeness and consistency. This paper presents an approach to this problem in which a learner seeks rules optimizing a rule quality criterion that combines the rule coverage (a measure of completeness) and training accuracy (a measure of inconsistency). These factors are combined into a single rule quality measure through a lexicographical evaluation functional (LEF). The method has been implemented in the AQ18 learning system for natural induction and pattern discovery, and compared with several other methods. Experiments have shown that the proposed method can be easily tailored to different problems and can simulate different rule learners by modifying the parameter of the rule quality criterion.

J	Sweeney, PC; Lyons, GM; Veltink, PH				Sweeney, PC; Lyons, GM; Veltink, PH			Finite state control of functional electrical stimulation for the rehabilitation of gait	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Review						finite state control; functional electrical stimulation; (FES); gait rehabilitation	LEARNING TECHNIQUES; SYSTEMS; MUSCLE; PARAPLEGICS; LOCOMOTION; WALKING; EVENTS	Finite state control is an established technique for the implementation of intention detection and activity co-ordination levels of hierarchical control in neural prostheses, and has been used for these purposes over the last thirty years. The first finite state controllers (FSC) in the functional electrical stimulation of gait were manually crafted systems, based on observations of the events occurring during the gait cycle. Subsequent systems used machine learning to automatically learn finite state control behaviour directly from human experts. Recently, fuzzy control has been utilised as an extension of finite state control, resulting in improved state defection over standard finite state control systems in some instances. Clinical experience over the last thirty years has been positive, and has shown finite state control to be an effective and intuitive method for the control of functional electrical stimulation (FES) in neural prostheses. However, while finite state controlled neural prostheses are of interest in the research community, they are not widely used outside of this setting. This is largely due to the cumbersome nature of many neural prostheses which utilise externally mounted gait sensors and FES electrodes. FES-based control of movement has been subject to the constraints of artificial sensor and FES actuator technologies. However, continued advances in natural sensors and implanted multi-channel stimulators are broadening the boundaries of artificial control of movement driving an evolutionary process towards increasingly humanlike control of FES-based gait rehabilitation systems.

J	Kell, DB; King, RD				Kell, DB; King, RD			On the optimization of classes for the assignment of unidentified reading frames in functional genomics programmes: the need for machine learning	TRENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; GENE-EXPRESSION; YEAST; PATTERNS; GROWTH; SCALE	At present, the assignment of function to novel genes uncovered by the systematic genome-sequencing programmes is a problem. Many studies anticipate that this can be achieved by analysing patterns of gene expression via the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Thus, functional genomics is, in part, an exercise in pattern classification. Because many genes have known functional classes, the problem of predicting their functional class is a supervised learning problem. However, most pattern classification methods that have been applied to the problem have been unsupervised clustering methods. Consequently, the best classification tools have not always been used. Furthermore, the present functional classes are suboptimal and new unsupervised clustering methods are needed to improve them. Better-structured functional classes will facilitate the prediction of biochemically testable functions.

J	Gamberger, D; Lavrac, N; Dzeroski, S				Gamberger, D; Lavrac, N; Dzeroski, S			Noise detection and elimination in data preprocessing: Experiments in medical domains	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Compression measures used in inductive learners, such as measures based on the minimum description length principle, can be used as a basis for grading candidate hypotheses. Compression-based induction is suited also for handling noisy data. This paper shows that a simple compression measure can be used to detect noisy training examples, where noise is due to random classification errors. A technique is proposed in which noisy examples are detected and eliminated from the training set, and a hypothesis is then built from the set of remaining examples. This noise elimination method was applied to preprocess data for four machine-learning algorithms, and evaluated on selected medical domains.

The motivation for and reasoning behind such a model is given and the desire for a 'transparent' model and meaningful visualization and interpretation techniques is noted. A minimalist formulation of an artificial immune system and some of its behaviour is described. A simple implementation and a suitable visualization technique are demonstrated using some trivial data and the famous 'iris' data set. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wilson, DR; Martinez, TR				Wilson, DR; Martinez, TR			An integrated instance-based learning algorithm	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						inductive learning; instance-based learning; classification; pruning; distance function; distance-weighting; voting; parameter estimation	NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM; SIMILARITY; FEATURES	The basic nearest-neighbor rule generalizes well in many domains but has several shortcomings, including inappropriate distance functions, large storage requirements, slow execution time, sensitivity to noise, and an inability to adjust its decision boundaries after storing the training data. This paper proposes methods for overcoming each of these weaknesses and combines the methods into a comprehensive learning system called the Integrated Decremental Instance-Based Learning Algorithm (IDIBL) that seeks to reduce storage, improve execution speed, and increase generalization accuracy, when compared to the basic nearest neighbor algorithm and other learning models. IDIBL tunes its own parameters using a new measure of fitness that combines confidence and cross-validation accuracy in order to avoid discretization problems with more traditional leave-one-out cross-validation. Tn our experiments IDIBL achieves higher generalization accuracy than other less comprehensive instance-based learning algorithms, while requiring less than one-fourth the storage of the nearest neighbor algorithm and improving execution speed by a corresponding factor. In experiments on twenty-one data sets, IDIBL also achieves higher generalization accuracy than that reported for sixteen major machine learning and neural network models.

Artificial neural networks, physical sequence analysis using high-performance optimization, and hidden Markov models identify extremely variable signal peptides (the vehicles of protein transport across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane), transmembrane segments, and specific extracellular and intracellular domains as indicators of possible roles in the intercellular and intracellular chemical_signaling pathways.

J	Nieddu, L; Patrizi, G				Nieddu, L; Patrizi, G			Formal methods in pattern recognition: A review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Review						artificial intelligence; expert systems; classification; machine learning	DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM	There is lot of excitement with Pattern Recognition methods with high precision, since this problem area is a well established field of Operations Research (O.R.). Recent work of some researchers has shown that O.R. methods in general and Optimisation methods in particular, can be applied to give some very good results. Thus this research area has been won back from the Artificial Intelligence community and is quickly becoming once more a fast growing field in O.R. The aim of this review is to examine the early success of classification methods and Pattern Recognition methods, consider their downfall and examine the new techniques that have been applied to make it like a resurgent Phoenix. it will be shown that optimisation methods, if carried out properly, through a formal analysis of their structure and their requirements can achieve correct classification with probability one. Many researchers make it more difficult for themselves by not considering the formalisation of the task concerned and so adapt heuristics to the problem. Computational methods taken from the Irvine Repository database on recognition instances will be placed in evidence. The outline of the paper is as follows. After the introduction a historical sketch of the field will be presented. Then in Section 3, the need for formal methods will be argued and various results on formal requirements as convergence etc. will be derived. Many of these formal requirements are of course related to the best-unbiased estimate (b.u.e) requirements in Statistics. In Section 4 some popular algorithms for Pattern Recognition will be presented and their degree of satisfaction of the formal requirements stressed, allowing in Section 5 to present many applications, so that conclusions can be reached in Section 6. It will be found that the satisfaction of the formal requirements is a necessary and sufficient condition to reach recognition with probability one. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thus, the sensitivity of the system is reduced and, thereby, the stability of the DCVRS is improved. The predictive abilities of two different paradigms, neural-network-based predictors and difference equation predictors obtained by equation discovery system LAGRAMGE, are compared.

The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of hand printed Arabic characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over the large degree of variation between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example. The system was tested on a sample of handwritten characters from several individuals whose writing ranged from acceptable to poor in quality and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 89.65%.

J	Wang, H; Duntsch, I; Gediga, G				Wang, H; Duntsch, I; Gediga, G			Classificatory filtering in decision systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						artificial intelligence; machine learning; rough set; data filtering; data reduction; decision system; lattice	ROUGH	Classificatory data filtering is concerned with reducing data in size while preserving classification information. Duntsch and Gediga [I. Duntsch, G. Gediga, International Journal of Approximate Reasoning 18 (1998) 93-106] presented a first approach to this problem. Their technique collects values of a single feature into a single value. In this paper we present a novel approach to classificatory filtering, which can be regarded as a generalisation of the approach in the above mentioned paper. This approach is aimed at collecting values of a set of features into a single value. We look at the problem abstractly in the context of lattices. We focus on hypergranules (arrays of sets) in a problem domain, and it turns out the collection of all hypergranules can be made into a lattice. Our solution (namely, LM algorithm) is formulated to find a set of maximal elements for each class, which covers all elements in a given dataset and is consistent with the dataset. This is done through the lattice sum operation. In terms of decision systems, LM collects attributes values while preserving classification structure. To use the filtered data for classification, we present and justify two measures (C-0 and C-1) for the relationship between two hypergranules. Based on the measures, we propose an algorithm (C2) for classification. Both algorithms are evaluated using real world datasets and are compared with C4.5. The result is analysed using statistical test methods and it turns out that there is no statistical difference between the two. Regression analysis shows that the reduction ratio is a strong indicator of prediction success. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, BS; Hung, JC				Chen, BS; Hung, JC			Fixed-order H-2 and H-infinity optimal deconvolution filter designs	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						genetic algorithm; deconvolution filter; H-2 criterion; H-infinity criterion	SYSTEMS	For the simplicity of implementation and saving of operation time, the fixed-order optimal deconvolution filter design is appealing for engineers in signal processing from practical design perspective. In this study, a design method based on genetic algorithms is proposed to simultaneously treat with H-2 and H-infinity optimal signal reconstruction design problem with prescribed filter order. Genetic algorithms are optimization and machine learning algorithms, initially inspired from the processes of natural selection and evolutionary genetics. They tend to find the global optimum solution without becoming trapped at local minima. Both IIR and FIR cases are discussed in this study. The convergence property of our design algorithm is also discussed by Markov chain method. Two design examples of H-2 and H-infinity optimal deconvolution with fixed-order filters are given to illustrate the design procedure and the performance of the proposed design methods, respectively.

J	Kampichler, C; Dzeroski, S; Wieland, R				Kampichler, C; Dzeroski, S; Wieland, R			Application of machine learning techniques to the analysis of soil ecological data bases: relationships between habitat features and Collembolan community characteristics	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ARABLE SOILS; MECHANISMS	We applied novel modelling techniques (neural networks, tree-based models) to relate total abundance and species number of Collembola as well as abundances of dominant species to habitat characteristics and compared their predictive power with simple statistical models (multiple regression, linear regression, land-use-specific means). The data used consisted of soil biological, chemical and physical measurements in soil cores taken at 396 points distributed over a 50 x 50 m sampling grid in an agricultural landscape in southern Germany. Neural networks appeared to be most efficient in reflecting the nonlinearities of the habitat-Collembola relationships. The underlying functional relations, however, are hidden within the network connections and cannot be analyzed easily. Model trees - next in predictive power to neural networks - are much more transparent and give an explicit picture of the functional relationships. Both modelling approaches perform significantly better than traditional statistical models and decrease the mean absolute error between prediction and observation by about 16-38%. Total carbon content and measurements highly correlated with it (e.g. total nitrogen content, microbial biomass and respiration) were the most important factors influencing the Collembolan community, This is in broad agreement with existing knowledge. Apparent limitations to predicting Collembolan abundance and species number by habitat quality alone are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	You, J; Kim, TJ				You, J; Kim, TJ			Development and evaluation of a hybrid travel time forecasting model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						GIS; travel time forecasting; non-parametric regression; historical database; machine learning; parameter adjustment		The purpose of this paper is to develop and evaluate a hybrid travel time forecasting model with geographic information systems (GIS) technologies for predicting link travel times in congested road networks. In a separate study by You and Kim (cf. You, J., Kim, T.J., 1999b. In: Proceedings of the Third Pi-Annual Conference of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 14-17 September, Taipei, Taiwan), a non-parametric regression model has been developed as a core forecasting algorithm to reduce computation time and increase forecasting accuracy. Using the core forecasting algorithm, a prototype hybrid forecasting model has been developed and tested by deploying GIS technologies in the following areas: (1) storing, retrieving, and displaying traffic data to assist in the forecasting procedures, (2) building road network data, and (3) integrating historical databases and road network data. This study shows that adopting GIS technologies in link travel time forecasting is efficient for achieving two goals: (1) reducing computational delay and (2) increasing forecasting accuracy.

J	Arzi, Y; Herbon, A				Arzi, Y; Herbon, A			Machine learning based adaptive production control for a multi-cell flexible manufacturing system operating in a random environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							SCHEDULING KNOWLEDGE; FMS; RULES	An adaptive production control approach is used for controlling a multi-cell FMS with machines subject to failures, operating in a highly changing produce-to-order environment. A probabilistic machine learning procedure is integrated within a two-level Distribution Production Control System (DPCS). This enables the DPCS to adapt itself to large fluctuations in demand as well as to other stochastic factors. An extensive simulation study shows that the proposed adaptive control approach significantly improves the production system performance in terms of a combined measure of throughput and order tardiness. The proposed DPCS can be easily implemented as a real-time DPCS due to its simplicity, modularity and the limited information it requires. The proposed adaptive scheme can be integrated in any parametric production control system.

Although its limitations with respect to expressive power, this procedure has a surprisingly good performance in a wide variety of domains, including many where there are clear dependencies between attributes. In this paper we address its main perceived limitation - its inability to deal with attribute dependencies. We present Linear Bayes that uses, for the continuous attributes, a multivariate normal distribution to compute the require probabilities. In this way, the interdependencies between the continuous attributes are considered. On the empirical evaluation, we compare Linear Bayes against a naive-Bayes that discretize continuous attributes, a naive-Bayes that assumes a univariate Gaussian for continuous attributes, and a standard Linear discriminant function. We show that Linear Bayes is a plausible algorithm, that competes quite well against other well established techniques.

The process of learning classification rules is visualized, which consists of five components: preparing and visualizing the original data, cleaning the original data, discretizing numerical attributes, learning classification rules, and visualizing the discovered rules. The CViz system is presented and each component is discussed. Three approaches for discretizing numerical attributes, including equal-length, equal-depth, and entropy-based approaches, are provided. The algorithm ELEM2 for learning classification rules is introduced, and the approaches to visualizing discretized data and classification rules are proposed. CViz could be easily adapted to visualize the rule induction process of other rule-based learning systems. Our experimental results on the IRIS data, Monks data, and artificial data show that the CViz system is useful and helpful for visualizing and understanding the learning process of classification rules.

This situation arises in many applications, e.g., identifying medical images, webpages, sensing data, etc. where it is hard and expensive to label the examples while it is much easier to acquire unlabeled examples. We suppose that the training data is distributed in the mixture model with Gaussian components. An approach to selecting typical examples for learning classifiers is proposed, and the typicality measure is defined with respect to the labeled data according to the Mahalanobis squared distance. The algorithm for selecting typical examples is described. The basic idea is that a training example is randomly drawn, and its typicality is measured. If the typicality is greater than the threshold, then the training example is sampled. The number of typical examples sampled is limited to memory capacity.

We propose a number of such principles and we discuss the ways in which different principles can be used together to explain discovery systems and guide their construction. Automated discovery is closely linked to natural sciences, logic, philosophy of science and theory of knowledge, artificial intelligence, statistics, and machine learning. Knowledge discovery tools use a creative combination of knowledge and techniques from the contributing areas, adding its own extra value, which we emphasize in several principles.

The aim is not only to study the performance, but also to examine its dependence on different thematic domains. Results are presented here for two different test cases: a corpus on "management succession events" and a general-theme corpus. The two experiments show that the performance of this method does not depend on the thematic domain of the corpus, and its accuracy for the Greek language is around 95%.

First of all, it introduces a hierarchical structure of the multiagent design system and takes a mechanical design system as an example. This structure provide a computational platform for cooperative design and sharing learning of multiple design agents; Then it analyses the principle of design activity and puts forward the architecture and learning mechanism of a design agent in details. The architecture of a design agent is for providing support for learning activity, and it is based on the analysis for the design activity; This is followed by a description of the design knowledge base framework and sharing learning process of multiagent. The main advantages of the system is that complex design task can be done by multiagent in a distributed environment and learning results can be shared by a group of design agents. This system has partly been implemented in a Visual C ++ -based and Mechanical Desktop 2.0 environment.

Unfortunately, most of these tests do not take into account the variability due to the choice of training set. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error that takes into account the variability due to the choice of training sets. This allows us to propose two new ways to estimate this variance. We show, via simulations, that these new statistics perform well relative to the statistics considered by Dietterich (Dietterich, 1998).

One of the simplest adaptive models is the factor analyzer, which is a two-layer network that models bottom layer sensory inputs as a linear combination of top layer factors plus independent Gaussian sensor noise. We show that local probability propagation in the factor analyzer network usually takes just a few iterations to perform accurate inference, even in networks with 320 sensors and 80 factors. We derive an expression for the algorithm's fixed point and show that this fixed point matches the exact solution in a variety of networks, even when the fixed point is unstable. We also show that this method can be used successfully to perform inference for approximate EM and we give results on an online face recognition task.

We claim that this interaction has been fruitful and allowed in a few years the appearance of formal theoretical results establishing the quality or not of the Grammatical Inference techniques, and probably more importantly the discovery of new algorithms that can infer a variety of types of grammars and automata from heterogeneous data.

Typically, a graph representing an unknown pattern is matched with a database of models. If the database of model graphs is large, an additional factor in induced into the overall complexity of the matching process. Various techniques for reducing the influence of this additional factor have been described in the literature. In this paper we propose to extract simple features from a graph and use them to eliminate candidate graphs from the database. The most powerful set of features and a decision tree useful for candidate elimination are found by means of the C4.5 algorithm, which was originally proposed for inductive learning of classification rules. Experimental results are reported demonstrating that efficient candidate elimination can be achieved by the proposed procedure.

The goal of the project is to integrate into one system a number of techniques, execution mechanisms and development tools that were designed in various areas in Logic Programming in the past. Main components are: a strong support for (declarative) knowledge representation, including aspects of incomplete knowledge, first order logic constraints and definitional knowledge; integration of different computational mechanisms, including resolution, abduction, tabling and constraint solving; integration within the development environment of semantics-based development tools, including (source-level) optimization, abstract interpretation based analysis and termination analysis. In developing this new system, we hope to contribute to an effort of semi-automating (part of) the software development process. We plan to experiment with a number of applications to test the system. Main applications in focus are in temporal reasoning, planning and scheduling, and machine learning.

There are, however, a number of areas, such as agents, where learning tasks are incremental. This paper defines the notion of incrementality for learning tasks and algorithms. It then provides some motivation for incremental learning and argues in favour of the design of incremental learning algorithms for solving incremental learning tasks. A number of issues raised by such systems are outlined and the incremental learner ILA is used for illustration.

In relational learning, matching, can be vie-wed as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). The complexity of the task is analyzed in the Phase Transition framework, investigating the impact on the effectiveness of two relational learners: FOIL and G-NET. The critical factors of complexity, and their critical values, are experimentally investigated on artificial problems. This leads to distinguish several kinds of learning domains, depending on whether the target concept lies in the "mushy" region or not. Interestingly, experiments done with FOIL and G-NET show that both learners tend to induce hypotheses generating matching problems located inside the. phase transition region, even if the constructed target concept lies far outside. Moreover, target concepts constructed too close to the phase transition are hard and both learners fail. The paper offers an explanation for this fact, and proposes a classification of learning domains and their hardness.

The tool, named WebClass, can be used for resource discovery purposes. Information considered by the system is both the textual contents of Web pages and the layout structure defined by HTML tags. The representation language adopted for Web pages is the bag-of-words, where words are selected from training documents by means of a novel scoring measure. Three different classification models are empirically compared on a classification task: Decision trees, centroids, and k-nearest-neighbor. Experimental results are reported and conclusions are drawn on the relevance of the HTML layout structure for classification purposes, on the significance of words selected by the scoring measure, as well as on the performance of the different classifiers.

As a consequence, the goal of web-based extraction systems is usually taken to be the creation of high-quality, noise-free data with clear semantics. This is a difficult problem which cannot be completely automated. Here we consider instead the problem of extracting web data for certain machine learning systems: specifically, collaborative filtering (CF) and concept learning (CL) systems. CF and CL systems are highly tolerant of noisy input, and hence much simpler extraction systems can be used in this context. For CL, we will describe a simple method that uses a given set of web pages to construct new features, which reduce the error rate of learned classifiers in a wide variety of situations. For CF, we will describe a simple method that automatically collects useful information from the web without any human intervention. The collected information, represented as "pseudo-users", can be used to "jumpstart" a CF system when the user base is small (or even absent).

Emerging applications in science and industry require learning much more complex functions that map from complex input spaces (e.g., 2-dimensional maps, time series, and strings) to complex output spaces (e.g., other 2-dimensional maps, time series, and strings). Despite the lack of theory covering such cases, many practical systems have been built that work well in particular applications. These systems all employ some form of divide-and-conquer, where the inputs and outputs are divided into smaller pieces (e.g., "windows"), classified, and then the results are merged to produce an overall solution. This paper defines the problem of divide-and-conquer learning and identifies the key research questions that need to be studied in order to develop practical, general-purpose learning algorithms for divide-and-conquer problems and an associated theory.

Also, unlabeled data are abundant. We investigate in this paper the design of learning algorithms from positive and unlabeled data only. Many machine learning and data mining algorithms use examples for estimate of probabilities. Therefore, we design an algorithm which is based on positive statistical queries (estimates for probabilities over the set of positive instances) and instance statistical queries (estimates for probabilities over the instance space). Our algorithm guesses the weight of the target concept (the ratio of positive instances in the instance space) with the help of a hypothesis testing algorithm. It is proved that any class learnable in the Statistical Query model [Kea93] such that a lower bound on the weight of any target concept f can be estimated in polynomial time is learnable from positive statistical queries and instance statistical queries only. Then, we design a decision tree induction algorithm POSC4.5, based on C4.5 (Qui93), using only positive and unlabeled examples. We also give experimental results for this algorithm.

This paper is concerned with structural complexity issues regarding the selection of relevant Prototypes or Features. We give the first results proving that both problems can be much harder than expected in the literature for various notions of relevance. In particular, the worst-case bounds achievable by any efficient algorithm are proven to be very large, most of the time not. so far from trivial bounds. We think these results give a theoretical justification for the numerous heuristic approaches found in the literature to cope with these problems.

This tutorial article presents the fundamentals of rough set theory in a nontechnical manner and outlines how the technique can be used to extract minimal if-then rules from tables of empirical data that either fully or approximately describe given example classifications. An example application for prediction of ambulation for patients with spinal cord injury is given. Because such rules are readily interpretable, they can be inspected to yield possible new insight into how various contributing factors interact and, thus, serve as hypothesis generators for further research. Additionally, the set of mined rules may function as a classifier of new, unseen cases.

A modified IREP algorithm (RTPPERk) may be applied to raw data representing a classification problem. Introduced by Cohen, 1995,(2.) RIPPERk generates a set of hypotheses in the form of if then rules. The resulting solution maybe coarse or complete, covering all outlyers in the classification data set. Yet another version of IREP has been introduced,(3.) which generates an EMYCIN rule set with certainty factors. The resulting system can then be translated into an expert network, where the certainty factors determine the synaptic weights and the EMYCIN rule set determines an acyclic computational network architecture with linear synapses.(6.) It has been demonstrated that Expert Network Back-propagation (ENBP) will further refine the network through supervised learning.(3.) The research examines the effect of inserting nodes that are capable of learning. The described network enhancement is appropriate when the benefit of a large set of RTPPERk modeling exemplars is not available.

The methods proposed construct cross-validation folds deterministically instead of using the random sampling approach. The deterministic construction of folds is performed using unsupervised stratification by exploiting the distribution of instances in the instance space. Our methods are based either on the one-center approach or on clustering procedures. These methods attempt to construct more representative folds, therefore reducing the bias of the resulting estimator. At the same time, our methods allow direct comparisons between the performance of learning algorithms in different experiments, since no randomness is present, A simulation experiment examining the performance of the proposed methods is reported, depicting their behavior in a variety of situations, The new methods reduce mainly the bias of the estimator.

We have developed and implemented the PLAGIATOR system which proves theorems by mathematical induction with the aid of a human advisor: If a base or step formula is submitted to the system, it tries to reuse a proof of a previously verified formula. If successful, labour is saved, because the number of required user interactions is decreased. Otherwise the human advisor is called for providing a hand crafted proof for such a formula, which subsequently-after some (automated) preparation steps-is stored in the system's memory, to be in stock for future reasoning problems. Besides the potential savings of resources, the performance of the overall system is improved, because necessary lemmata might be speculated as the result of an attempt to reuse a proof The success of the approach is based on our techniques for preparing given proofs as well as by our methods for retrieval and adaptation of reuse candidates which are promising for future proof reuses. We prove the soundness of our approach and illustrate its performance with several examples. ()C 2000 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

For most ensemble methods the ensemble members are combined by weighted summation of the output, called the linear average predictor. The logarithmic opinion pool ensemble method uses a multiplicative combination of the ensemble members, which treats the outputs of the ensemble members as independent probabilities. The advantage of the logarithmic opinion pool is the connection to the Kullback-Leibler error function, which can be decomposed into two terms: An average of the error of the ensemble members, and the ambiguity The ambiguity is independent of the target function, and can be estimated using unlabeled data. The advantage of the decomposition is that an unbiased estimate of the generalization error of the ensemble can be obtained, while training still is on the full training set. These properties can be used to improve classification. The logarithmic opinion pool ensemble method is tested on the prediction of protein secondary structure. The focus is on how much improvement the general ensemble method can give rather than on outperforming existing methods, because that typically involves several more steps of refinement.

We show how to generate case-based explanations for non-case-based machine learning methods such as artificial neural nets. The method uses the neural net as a distance metric to determine which cases in the training set are most similar to a test case that needs to be explained.

We have implemented nearest-neighbors and locally weighted regression algorithms, introducing also a dimensionality reduction preprocessing stage using principal component analysis. Our experimental results show that these algorithms are capable of predicting effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity quickly and accurately. We observe that dimensionality reduction, besides significantly reducing the computation time, can also improve the accuracy of the resulting predictions. We envisage the use of such methods for large spectroscopic surveys currently in progress.

We show that the hypergraphs of all multiple and all partial transversals are dual- bounded in the sense that in both cases, the size of the dual hypergraph is bounded by a polynomial in the cardinality and the length of description of the input hypergraph. Our bounds are based on new inequalities of extremal set theory and threshold logic, which may be of independent interest. We also show that the problems of generating all multiple and all partial transversals of an arbitrary hypergraph are polynomial-time reducible to the well-known dualization problem of hypergraphs. As a corollary, we obtain incremental quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for both of the above problems, as well as for the generation of all the minimal Boolean solutions for an arbitrary monotone system of linear inequalities. Thus, it is unlikely that these problems are NP-hard.

Unification problems are an important special case of equational formulae, where no universal quantifiers and no negation occur. By the negation elimination problem we mean the problem of deciding whether a given equational formula is semantically equivalent to a unification problem. This decision problem has many interesting applications in machine learning, logic programming, functional programming, constrained rewriting, etc. In this work we present a new algorithm for the negation elimination problem of equational formulas with purely existential quantifier prefix. Moreover, we prove the coNP-completeness for equational formulae in DNF and the Pi(2)(P)-hardness in case of CNF.

These methods prove indispensable in abdominal CT images. Further work is needed in heart ultrasound images. The methods apply in any domain with consistent image conditions characterizing object boundaries, for which automated identification is nontrivial, perhaps due to interfering detail. A traditional strongest-edge-seeking snake fails to find an object's boundary when the strongest nearby image edges are not the ones sought. But we show how to instead learn, from training data, the relation between a shape and any image feature, as the probability distribution (PDF) of a function of image and shape. An important but neglected task has always been to select image qualities to guide a model. Because success depends on the relation of objective function (PDF) output to shape correctness, it is evaluated using a sampling of ground truth, a random model of the range of shapes tried during optimization, and a measure of shape closeness. The test results are evaluated for incidence of "false positives" (scoring better than ground truth) versus incorrectness, and for the objective function's monotonicity with respect to incorrectness. Monotonicity is measured using correlation coefficient and using the newly introduced distance from closest increasing function. Domain-dependent choices must be tested. We analyze several Gaussian models fitting image intensity and perpendicular gradient at the object boundary, as well as the traditional sum of gradient magnitudes. The latter model is found inadequate in our domains; some of the former succeed.

These algorithms have a great ability for adaptation to each new situation they appear in time, or to a new context. In this paper we propose an algorithm for identifying the moments when the context of the 'environment' changes. The key idea is that if the predictor; which was based on some previous examples, becomes crucially inconsistent with new examples then we identify context change at the placement of this instance. If most of the predictors from diverse ensemble start to identify context change then we report total context change. We experimentally illustrate that this idea works very well on Vowel recognition dataset.

We previously developed evolution-based and self-organization models of the floor level that are able to cope with environmental changes such as system reconfiguration, machine breakdown and unforeseen production requests. This paper describes reinforcement learning approaches to the modeling of EMS, in order to deal with the various kinds of complex global objectives. The effectiveness of the proposed model is also discussed by simulation with global objectives.

Based on ideas from the fields of statistics, machine learning and knowledge engineering we provided a general framework for defining user support. The general framework contains a combined top-down and bottom-up strategy to tackle this problem. In the current paper we describe the Algorithm Selection Tool (AST) that is one component in our framework. AST is designed to support algorithm selection in the knowledge discovery process with a case-based reasoning approach. We discuss the architecture of AST and explain the basic components. We present the evaluation of our approach in a systematic analysis of the case retrieval behaviour and thus of the selection support offered by our system.

One important reason for this is the necessity to browse long reference lists manually, because of the well-known problems of relevance ranking. A possible remedy is to complement the references with automatically generated labels which provide valuable information about the referenced information source. Presenting suitably labelled lists of references to users aims at improving the clarity and thus comprehensibility of the information offered and at reducing the search cost. In the following we survey several dimensions for labelling (time, frequency of usage, region, language, subject, industry, and preferences) and the corresponding classification problems. To solve these problems automatically we sketch for each problem a pragmatic mix of machine learning methods and report selected results.

Their results appear to indicate that no intelligence is required to give human-like trading performance. Cliff and Bruten (1997) demonstrated serious failings of ZI traders. Here, 'ZI-plus' (ZIP) traders are introduced: simple stochastic agents that adapt over time using an elementary form of machine learning. It is shown that the performance of ZIP traders is significantly closer to the human data than is that of ZI traders. Thus, human-like trading behavior can be achieved with intelligence that is more than zero but much less than human. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

On the one hand, it attempts to define an specific framework to make comparative studies of different statistical and machine learning methods in the context of regression analysis. On the other, it takes a specific known economics problem and apply this framework using different algorithms-OLS, neural network, decision tree, and k-nearest; neighbor. This methodology is based on the study of the error curves-the behavior of the root mean square error (RMSE) when varying the sample size and the capacity (degrees of freedom) of each analytical method. Using state-of-the art techniques we build more than 13,920 models to test the methodology by recovering a restricted version of the Black-Scholes call option pricing formula with noise-where the instantaneous standard deviation of the noise is 0.78. The results show that-given the level of noise-neural networks provide the best estimation with an average RMSE of 0.7825 for a training sample of 6,000 records. OLS is the second best with an average RMSE of 0.7861 and its first best for sample sizes smaller than 1,125. The k-Nearest Neighbor achieved, an average RMSE of 0.8380 which is comparable to the worst performer CART which attained an average RMSE of 0.8721.(1)	Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA	Flores, JG (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

Models for predicting pavement performance have been developed on the basis of traffic and time-related models, interactive time traffic or distress models. The characteristic feature of the models is that they are formulated and estimated statistically, recently however artificial neural networks are being used. The purpose of this paper is to extend the use of the adaptive logic networks in pavement performance modeling, by investigating the effect of different learning rates of adaptive logic networks in pavement performance modeling. Adaptive logic networks (ALN) has recently emerged as an effective alternative to artificial neural networks for machine learning tasks. Adaptive logic networks (ALN) is a network arranged as a binary tree, where the processing element has exactly two inputs and one output. Each processing element, or node, computes one of the four logical functions AND, OR, RIGHT (MAX) and LEFT (MIN). The root node of the tree represents the output of the network, while the leaves of the tree are connected to the input variables and /or their complements.

The main feature of the method is to transform the original input vectors into high-dimensional space, and then construct a linear regression function or hyperplane in that space. The transformation is usually done by applying the kernel technique. The paper then shows that the same kernel technique can be applied to classical algorithms such as Ridge Regression. In conclusion, we present a new transductive learning algorithm that also allows us to compute confidence levels.

In this project, a genetics-based machine learning system was implemented to generate high angle-of-attack air combat tactics for advanced fighter aircraft. This system, which was based on a learning classifier system approach, employed a digital simulation model of one-versus-one air combat, and a genetic algorithm, to develop effective tactics for the X-31 experimental fighter aircraft. Previous efforts with this system showed that the resulting maneuvers allowed the X-31 to successfully exploit its post-stall capabilities against a conventional fighter opponent. This demonstrated the ability of the genetic learning system to discover novel tactics in a dynamic air combat environment. The results gained favorable evaluation from fighter aircraft test pilots. However, these pilots noted that the static strategy employed by the X-31's opponent was a limitation. In response to these comments, this paper reports new results with two-sided learning, where both aircraft in a one-versus-one combat scenario use genetics-based machine learning to adapt their strategies. The experiments successfully demonstrate both aircraft developing objectively interesting strategies. However, the results also point out the complexity of evaluating results from mutually adaptive players, due to the red queen effect. These complexities, and future directions of the project, are discussed in the paper's conclusions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

S	Eklund, PW		Ganter, B; Mineau, GW		Eklund, PW			Logic-based networks: Concept graphs and conceptual structures	CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES: LOGICAL, LINGUISTIC, AND COMPUTATIONAL ISSUES, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Conceptual Structures (ICCS 2000)	AUG 14-18, 2000	DARMSTADT, GERMANY					Logic-based networks are semantic networks that support reasoning capabilities. In this paper, knowledge processing within logic-based networks is viewed as three stages. The first stage involves the formation of concepts and relations: the basic primitives with which we wish to formulate knowledge. The second stage involves the formation of well-formed formulas that express knowledge about the primitive concepts and relations once isolated. The final stage involves efficiently processing the wffs to the desired end. Our research involves each of these steps as they relate to Sowa's conceptual structures and Wille's concept lattices. Formal Concept Analysis gives us a capability to perform concept formation via symbolic machine learning. Concept(ual) Graphs provide a means to describe relational properties between primitive concept and relation types. Finally, techniques from other areas of computer science are required to compute logic-based networks efficiently. This paper illustrated the three stages of knowledge processing in practical terms using examples from our research.

J	Duch, W				Duch, W			Similarity-based methods: a general framework for classification, approximation and association	CONTROL AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						similarity-based methods; kNN; optimization; feature selection; classification; approximation; associative memory	LEARNING ALGORITHMS	Similarity-based methods (SBM) are a generalization of the minimal distance (MD) methods which form a basis of several machine learning and pattern recognition methods. Investigation of similarity leads to a fruitful framework in which many classification, approximation and association methods are accommodated. Probability p(C\X; M) of assigning class C to a vector X, given a classification model M, depends on adaptive parameters and procedures used in construction of the model. Systematic overview of choices available for model building is presented and numerous improvements suggested. Similarity-Based Methods have natural neural-network type realizations. Such neural network models as the Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and the Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are included in this framework as special cases. SBM may also include several different submodels and a procedure to combine their results. Many new versions of similarity-based methods are derived from this framework. A search in the space of all methods belonging to the SBM framework finds a particular combination of parameterizations and procedures that is most appropriate for a given data. No single classification method can beat this approach. Preliminary implementation of SBM elements tested on a real-world datasets gave very good results.

In this economy, buyers use shopbots while the sellers employ automated pricing agents or pricebots. A pricebot resets its seller's price at regular intervals with the objective of maximizing revenue in each time period. Derivative following provides a simple, albeit naive, strategy for dynamic pricing in such a scenario. In this paper, we refine the derivative following algorithm and introduce a model-optimizer algorithm that re-estimates the price-profit relationship for a seller in each period more efficiently. Simulations using the model-optimizer algorithm indicate that it outperforms derivative following even though it does not have any additional information about the market. Our results underscore the role machine learning and optimization can play in fostering competition (or cooperation) in a multi-agent economy where the agents have limited information about their environment.

Our entire existence is a process of gathering, analyzing, understanding and acting on the information. For many applications dealing with large amount of data, Pattern classification is a key element in arriving at the solution. Engineering applications like SONAR, RADAR, SEISMIC and medical diagnosis require the ability to accurately classify the recorded data for controlling, tracking and decision making respectively. Although modern technologies enable storage of large streams of data, we do not yet have a technology to help us to understand, analyze, or even visualize the hidden information in the data. Data Mining is now the emerging field attracting all research communities, Pattern classification is one particular category of Data Mining, which enables the Discovery of Knowledge from Very Large Databases (VLDB). In this paper. mining the database through pattern classification has been done by utilizing two important mining tools called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Fuzzy logic concepts are applied to improve decision-making capability of the network. Genetic Algorithm is used for optimizing different parameters controlling the network in the training stage and reducing the total number of rules generated through the rule generation algorithm. The Artificial Neural Network used is a Fuzzy Multilayer Perceptron (FMLP) with Backpropagation algorithm for training the neural network. The concept of Knowledge encoding incorporated in the FMLP helps the network converge to the target quickly and thus reducing the search space. Knowledge based Fuzzy Multilayer Perceptron [FMLP], using fuzzy mean square error function has been proposed for Data Mining applications. The knowledge encoded network is trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The network size is optimized to have a minimal number of links through pruning procedure. Rules are generated from the refined network using the input, output membership values and connection weights. Each rule has an antecedent and consequent part defining the attributes and the confidence value. The network's performance is tested on the image segmentation data obtained from machine learning database sire.

Some scholars have done much work to interpret neural networks so that they will no longer be seen as black boxes and provided some plots and methods for knowledge acquisition using neural networks. These can be classified into three categories: fuzzy neural networks, CF (certainty factor) based neural networks, and logical neurons. We review some of these research works in this paper.

The growing perception of the advantage of putting information on-line beginning with the success of automated data processing in commercial and scientific enterprises has led to the collection and storage of larger amount of data. The mining of these large data's and discovering meaningful information, new correlations. patterns and trends using Artificial intelligence (AI) is called as data mining. One of the useful data mining tool is the neural network. A Neural Network which is the generalization of binary ARTMAP called Fuzzy ARTMAP is discussed in this paper and the results are compared with fuzzy ART, BPN and Cascade ARTMAP. The knowledge in the form of fuzzy rules is derived from the self-organizing supervised learning neural network called as fuzzy ARTMAP is shown. Pruning of the network reduces about 1/3 rd the size of the original network. Quantization of continuous learned weights allows the final system state to be translated into a usable set of rules. Quantization yields comprehensible rule with only slight degradation in the test set performance. Although accuracy is less compared to cascade ARTMAP, the rules extracted are more precise. Variation of test set accuracy with increase in training set ratio is studied. Finally the extracted rules are validated against original raw data. And moreover, Compared to the fuzzy ART. the predictive accuracy is found to be comparable and sometimes mon. Simulation is carried out using medical data bases taken from UCl repository of Machine Learning data bases.

For laminar now, analytical solutions are known, but also quasi-steady or empirical models can be applied A brief overview of these models is given in the first part. On the other hand, we used a different approach towards modelling unsteady pipe flow. Namely, instead of deriving equation from basic principles of dynamics, we tried to generate the differential equation describing the flow in a U-tube directly from the measured data using one of the automatic machine learning methods. For this purpose, a set of experiments was designed and performed Different water column lengths were tested in a pipe of diameter 2.5 cm. The now was mostly in laminar regime. Then the data mere analysed by an artificial intelligence (machine learning) tool for automated modelling of dynamic systems, called GoldHorn. Its short description is given. Furthermore, the required quality of data is discussed and an example of how noisy or invalid data can affect results is given. Next, the performed analyses are described and the results are shown. The structure of the discovered equations was matching those of above-mentioned unsteady and quasi-steady models. However, some of the values of obtained coefficients were different. Finally, the discussion from physical point of view and comparison with other models is given.

One approach commonly used is supervised machine learning, in which a set of training instances is used to train one or more classifiers that map the space formed by different features of the instances into the set of class values. The classifiers are later used to classify new instances with unknown class values. The multidimensional data is sometimes feature-space heterogeneous so that different features have different importance in different subareas of the whole space. In this paper we describe a technique that searches for a division of the feature space identifying the best subsets of features for each instance. Our technique is based on the wrapper approach where a classification algorithm is used as the evaluation function to differentiate between several feature subsets. On the other hand, to make the feature selection dynamic or local, we apply the recently developed technique for dynamic integration of classifiers to determine what classifier and with what feature subset is applied for each new instance. Our technique can be applied in the case of implicit heterogeneity when the regions of heterogeneity cannot be easily defined by a simple dependency. We make experiments with well-known datasets of the UCI machine learning repository using ensembles of simple base classifiers. The base classifiers discussed in the experiments are developed by C4.5 based on only one feature each but the combining method itself is allowed to take into account unlimited amount of present features. The results achieved are promising and show that the local data mining in comparison with mining the whole space can be advantageous. In many cases, the mining accuracy is better as well as the time of processing is shorter, because only a small set of features is used to classify each new instance.

For instance, some methods are inherently resilient to missing values while others have built-in methods for coping with them. Still others require that none of the values are missing; for such methods, preliminary imputation of missing values is indispensable. After a quick overview of current practice in the machine learning field, we explore the problem of missing values from a statistical perspective. In particular, we adopt the well-known distinction between three patterns of missing values-missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) and not missing at random (NMAR)-to focus a comparative study of eight learning algorithms from the point of view of their tolerance to incomplete data. Experiments on 47 datasets reveal a rough ranking from the most resilient (e.g., Naive Bayes) to the most sensitive (e.g., IBl and-surprisingly-C50rules). More importantly, results show that for a given amount of missing values, their dispersion among the predictive variables is at least as important as the pattern of missingness.
