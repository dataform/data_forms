Predicting phenotypes of asthma and eczema with machine learning	BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Annual Translational Bioinformatics Conference (TBC) / ISCB-Asia	OCT 02-04, 2013	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	ISCB Asia			EXHALED NITRIC-OXIDE; VARIABLE IMPORTANCE MEASURES; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; BRONCHIAL REACTIVITY; MANCHESTER ASTHMA; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; BIRTH COHORT; POPULATION; RISK; SENSITIZATION	Background: There is increasing recognition that asthma and eczema are heterogeneous diseases. We investigated the predictive ability of a spectrum of machine learning methods to disambiguate clinical sub-groups of asthma, wheeze and eczema, using a large heterogeneous set of attributes in an unselected population. The aim was to identify to what extent such heterogeneous information can be combined to reveal specific clinical manifestations. Methods: The study population comprised a cross-sectional sample of adults, and included representatives of the general population enriched by subjects with asthma. Linear and non-linear machine learning methods, from logistic regression to random forests, were fit on a large attribute set including demographic, clinical and laboratory features, genetic profiles and environmental exposures. Outcome of interest were asthma, wheeze and eczema encoded by different operational definitions. Model validation was performed via bootstrapping. Results: The study population included 554 adults, 42% male, 38% previous or current smokers. Proportion of asthma, wheeze, and eczema diagnoses was 16.7%, 12.3%, and 21.7%, respectively. Models were fit on 223 non-genetic variables plus 215 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In general, non-linear models achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than other methods, especially for asthma and wheeze, less for eczema, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of 84%, 76% and 64%, respectively. Our findings confirm that allergen sensitisation and lung function characterise asthma better in combination than separately. The predictive ability of genetic markers alone is limited. For eczema, new predictors such as bio-impedance were discovered. Conclusions: More usefully-complex modelling is the key to a better understanding of disease mechanisms and personalised healthcare: further advances are likely with the incorporation of more factors/attributes and longitudinal measures.

J	Shin, H; Nam, Y				Shin, Hyunjung; Nam, Yonghyun			A coupling approach of a predictor and a descriptor for breast cancer prognosis	BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Annual Translational Bioinformatics Conference (TBC) / ISCB-Asia	OCT 02-04, 2013	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	ISCB Asia			SURVIVABILITY; MODELS	Background: In cancer prognosis research, diverse machine learning models have applied to the problems of cancer susceptibility (risk assessment), cancer recurrence (redevelopment of cancer after resolution), and cancer survivability, regarding an accuracy (or an AUC-the area under the ROC curve) as a primary measurement for the performance evaluation of the models. However, in order to help medical specialists to establish a treatment plan by using the predicted output of a model, it is more pragmatic to elucidate which variables (markers) have most significantly influenced to the resulting outcome of cancer or which patients show similar patterns. Methods: In this study, a coupling approach of two sub-modules-a predictor and a descriptor-is proposed. The predictor module generates the predicted output for the cancer outcome. Semi-supervised learning co-training algorithm is employed as a predictor. On the other hand, the descriptor module post-processes the results of the predictor module, mainly focusing on which variables are more highly or less significantly ranked when describing the results of the prediction, and how patients are segmented into several groups according to the trait of common patterns among them. Decision trees are used as a descriptor. Results: The proposed approach, 'predictor-descriptor,' was tested on the breast cancer survivability problem based on the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database for breast cancer (SEER). The results present the performance comparison among the established machine leaning algorithms, the ranks of the prognosis elements for breast cancer, and patient segmentation. In the performance comparison among the predictor candidates, Semi-supervised learning co-training algorithm showed best performance, producing an average AUC of 0.81. Later, the descriptor module found the top-tier prognosis markers which significantly affect to the classification results on survived/dead patients: 'lymph node involvement', 'stage', 'site-specific surgery', 'number of positive node examined', and 'tumor size', etc. Also, a typical example of patient-segmentation was provided: the patients classified as dead were grouped into two segments depending on difference in prognostic profiles, ones with serious results with respect to the pathologic exams and the others with the feebleness of age.

Molecular mechanisms of increasing host range are largely unknown. Influenza surface proteins play determining roles in reorganization of host-sialic acid receptors and host range. In an attempt to uncover the physic-chemical attributes which govern HA subtyping, we performed a large scale functional analysis of over 7000 sequences of 16 different HA subtypes. Large number (896) of physic-chemical protein characteristics were calculated for each HA sequence. Then, 10 different attribute weighting algorithms were used to find the key characteristics distinguishing HA subtypes. Furthermore, to discover machine leaning models which can predict HA subtypes, various Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network models were trained on calculated protein characteristics dataset as well as 10 trimmed datasets generated by attribute weighting algorithms. The prediction accuracies of the machine learning methods were evaluated by 10-fold cross validation. The results highlighted the frequency of Gln (selected by 80% of attribute weighting algorithms), percentage/frequency of Tyr, percentage of Cys, and frequencies of Try and Glu (selected by 70% of attribute weighting algorithms) as the key features that are associated with HA subtyping. Random Forest tree induction algorithm and RBF kernel function of SVM (scaled by grid search) showed high accuracy of 98% in clustering and predicting HA subtypes based on protein attributes. Decision tree models were successful in monitoring the short mutation/reassortment paths by which influenza virus can gain the key protein structure of another HA subtype and increase its host range in a short period of time with less energy consumption. Extracting and mining a large number of amino acid attributes of HA subtypes of influenza A virus through supervised algorithms represent a new avenue for understanding and predicting possible future structure of influenza pandemics.

Fast k-NNG Construction with GPU-Based Quick Multi-Select	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEAREST-NEIGHBOR GRAPHS; ALGORITHM	In this paper, we describe a new brute force algorithm for building the k-Nearest Neighbor Graph (k-NNG). The k-NNG algorithm has many applications in areas such as machine learning, bio-informatics, and clustering analysis. While there are very efficient algorithms for data of low dimensions, for high dimensional data the brute force search is the best algorithm. There are two main parts to the algorithm: the first part is finding the distances between the input vectors, which may be formulated as a matrix multiplication problem; the second is the selection of the k-NNs for each of the query vectors. For the second part, we describe a novel graphics processing unit (GPU)-based multi-select algorithm based on quick sort. Our optimization makes clever use of warp voting functions available on the latest GPUs along with user-controlled cache. Benchmarks show significant improvement over state-of-the-art implementations of the k-NN search on GPUs.

The newly available knowledge can be exploited by machine learning methods to discover additional unknown genes that are likely to be associated with diseases. In particular, positive unlabeled learning (PU learning) methods, which require only a positive training set P (confirmed disease genes) and an unlabeled set U (the unknown candidate genes) instead of a negative training set N-1 have been shown to be effective in uncovering new disease genes in the current scenario. Using only a single source of data for prediction can be susceptible to bias due to incompleteness and noise in the genomic data and a single machine learning predictor prone to bias caused by inherent limitations of individual methods. In this paper, we propose an effective PU learning framework that integrates multiple biological data sources and an ensemble of powerful machine learning classifiers for disease gene identification. Our proposed method integrates data from multiple biological sources for training PU learning classifiers. A novel ensemble-based PU learning method EPU is then used to integrate multiple PU learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust disease gene predictions. Our evaluation experiments across six disease groups showed that EPU achieved significantly better results compared with various state-of-the-art prediction methods as well as ensemble learning classifiers. Through integrating multiple biological data sources for training and the outputs of an ensemble of PU learning classifiers for prediction, we are able to minimize the potential bias and errors in individual data sources and machine learning algorithms to achieve more accurate and robust disease gene predictions. In the future, our EPU method provides an effective framework to integrate the additional biological and computational resources for better disease gene predictions.

Based on this hypothesis, we propose an architecture for knowledge-based instance selection (KBIS) systems. It uses meta-learning to select the best suited instance selection method for each specific database, among several methods available. We carried out a study in order to verify whether this architecture can outperform the individual methods. Two different versions of a KBIS system based on our architecture, each using a different learner, were instantiated. They were evaluated experimentally and the results were compared to those of the individual methods used. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Essentially, traffic sign recognition is a multi-class classification problem that has become a real challenge for computer vision and machine learning techniques. Although many machine learning approaches are used for traffic sign recognition, they are primarily used for classification, not feature design. Identifying rich features using modern machine learning methods has recently attracted attention and has achieved success in many benchmarks. However these approaches have not been fully implemented in the traffic sign recognition problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle the traffic sign recognition problem. First, we introduce a new feature learning approach using group sparse coding. The primary goal is to exploit the intrinsic structure of the pre-learned visual codebook. This new coding strategy preserves locality and encourages similar descriptors to share similar sparse representation patterns. Second, we use a non-uniform quantization approach based on log-polar mapping. Using the log-polar mapping of the traffic sign image, rotated and scaled patterns are converted into shifted patterns in the new space. We extract the local descriptors from these patterns to learn the features. Finally, by evaluating the proposed approach using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset, we show that the proposed coding strategy outperforms existing coding methods and the obtained results are comparable to the state-of-the-art.

Ovary Transcriptome Profiling via Artificial Intelligence Reveals a Transcriptomic Fingerprint Predicting Egg Quality in Striped Bass, Morone saxatilis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL TRANSITION; EARLY XENOPUS-EMBRYOS; COP9 SIGNALOSOME; ZYGOTIC TRANSITION; UBIQUITIN LIGASES; LINKAGE ANALYSIS; ZEBRAFISH; CANCER; OOCYTE; FISH	Inherited gene transcripts deposited in oocytes direct early embryonic development in all vertebrates, but transcript profiles indicative of embryo developmental competence have not previously been identified. We employed artificial intelligence to model profiles of maternal ovary gene expression and their relationship to egg quality, evaluated as production of viable mid-blastula stage embryos, in the striped bass (Morone saxatilis), a farmed species with serious egg quality problems. In models developed using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and supervised machine learning, collective changes in the expression of a limited suite of genes (233) representing <2% of the queried ovary transcriptome explained >90% of the eventual variance in embryo survival. Egg quality related to minor changes in gene expression (<0.2-fold), with most individual transcripts making a small contribution (<1%) to the overall prediction of egg quality. These findings indicate that the predictive power of the transcriptome as regards egg quality resides not in levels of individual genes, but rather in the collective, coordinated expression of a suite of transcripts constituting a transcriptomic "fingerprint". Correlation analyses of the corresponding candidate genes indicated that dysfunction of the ubiquitin-26S proteasome, COP9 signalosome, and subsequent control of the cell cycle engenders embryonic developmental incompetence. The affected gene networks are centrally involved in regulation of early development in all vertebrates, including humans. By assessing collective levels of the relevant ovarian transcripts via ANNs we were able, for the first time in any vertebrate, to accurately predict the subsequent embryo developmental potential of eggs from individual females. Our results show that the transcriptomic fingerprint evidencing developmental dysfunction is highly predictive of, and therefore likely to regulate, egg quality, a biologically complex trait crucial to reproductive fitness.

Land use and land cover information provides a rapid and cost-effective means for monitoring and planning coastal area development. This study quantitatively describes spatiotemporal changes of land use and land cover over the last four decades in a coastal area of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Historical aerial photographs from 1976 and satellite images from 1990 and 2012 were classified and analyzed. We used supervised classification and machine learning techniques to classify the images. An accuracy assessment of results was performed. Land use change statistics for the period indicate that urban areas have increased to the detriment of dense vegetation, salines, and bare soil. The analysis provides a basis for better control of anthropogenic impacts and geoconservation activities in this coastal area of Rio de Janeiro.

J	Hasan, RC; Ierodiaconou, D; Laurenson, L; Schimel, A				Hasan, Rozaimi Che; Ierodiaconou, Daniel; Laurenson, Laurie; Schimel, Alexandre			Integrating Multibeam Backscatter Angular Response, Mosaic and Bathymetry Data for Benthic Habitat Mapping	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONTINENTAL-SHELF; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; ECHOSOUNDER DATA; MARINE HABITATS; SONAR IMAGERY; AUSTRALIA; FEATURES; VIDEO; SEGMENTATION	Multibeam echosounders (MBES) are increasingly becoming the tool of choice for marine habitat mapping applications. In turn, the rapid expansion of habitat mapping studies has resulted in a need for automated classification techniques to efficiently map benthic habitats, assess confidence in model outputs, and evaluate the importance of variables driving the patterns observed. The benthic habitat characterisation process often involves the analysis of MBES bathymetry, backscatter mosaic or angular response with observation data providing ground truth. However, studies that make use of the full range of MBES outputs within a single classification process are limited. We present an approach that integrates backscatter angular response with MBES bathymetry, backscatter mosaic and their derivatives in a classification process using a Random Forests (RF) machine-learning algorithm to predict the distribution of benthic biological habitats. This approach includes a method of deriving statistical features from backscatter angular response curves created from MBES data collated within homogeneous regions of a backscatter mosaic. Using the RF algorithm we assess the relative importance of each variable in order to optimise the classification process and simplify models applied. The results showed that the inclusion of the angular response features in the classification process improved the accuracy of the final habitat maps from 88.5% to 93.6%. The RF algorithm identified bathymetry and the angular response mean as the two most important predictors. However, the highest classification rates were only obtained after incorporating additional features derived from bathymetry and the backscatter mosaic. The angular response features were found to be more important to the classification process compared to the backscatter mosaic features. This analysis indicates that integrating angular response information with bathymetry and the backscatter mosaic, along with their derivatives, constitutes an important improvement for studying the distribution of benthic habitats, which is necessary for effective marine spatial planning and resource management.

There are many different approaches and methods which have been developed over the years. The aim of this paper is to create a credit risk rating model, using a machine learning methodology that combines accounting data with the option-based approach of Black, Scholes, and Merton. The model is built on data for companies listed in the Greek stock exchange, but it is also shown to provide accurate results for non-listed firms as well. Linear and nonlinear support vector machines are used for model building, as well as an innovative additive modeling approach, which enables the construction of comprehensible and accurate credit scoring models.

Bayesian multi-task learning for decoding multi-subject neuroimaging data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multi-task learning; Multi-output learning; Transfer learning; Gaussian process; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Repeated measures; Pattern recognition; Machine learning; Decoding; Mixed effects	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BOLD HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; FMRI DATA; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; BRAIN-REGIONS; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; DISEASE	Decoding models based on pattern recognition (PR) are becoming increasingly important tools for neuroimaging data analysis. In contrast to alternative (mass-univariate) encoding approaches that use hierarchical models to capture inter-subject variability, inter-subject differences are not typically handled efficiently in PR. In this work, we propose to overcome this problem by recasting the decoding problem in a multi-task learning (MTL) framework. In MTL, a single PR model is used to learn different but related "tasks" simultaneously. The primary advantage of MTL is that it makes more efficient use of the data available and leads to more accurate models by making use of the relationships between tasks. In this work, we construct MTL models where each subject is modelled by a separate task. We use a flexible covariance structure to model the relationships between tasks and induce coupling between them using Gaussian process priors. We present an Am method for classification problems and demonstrate a novel mapping method suitable for PR models. We apply these MTL approaches to classifying many different contrasts in a publicly available fMRI dataset and show that the proposed MTL methods produce higher decoding accuracy and more consistent discriminative activity patterns than currently used techniques. Our results demonstrate that MTL. provides a promising method for multi-subject decoding studies by focusing on the commonalities between a group of subjects rather than the idiosyncratic properties Of different subjects.

We report results from a simple visual object recognition experiment where independent component analysis (ICA) data processing and machine learning classification were able to correctly distinguish presence of visual stimuli at around 87% (0.70 AUC, p <0.0001) accuracy within single trials, using data from single ICs. Seven subjects observed a series of everyday visual object stimuli while EEG was recorded. The task was to indicate whether or not they recognised each object as familiar to them. EEG or IC data from a subset of initial object presentations was used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, which then generated a label for subsequent data. Task-label classifier accuracy gives a proxy measure of task-related information present in the data used to train. This allows comparison of EEG data processing techniques - here, we found selected single ICs that give higher performance than when classifying from any single scalp EEG channel (0.70 AUC vs 0.65 AUC, p <0.0001). Most of these single selected ICs were found in occipital regions. Scoring a sliding analysis window moving through the time-points of the trial revealed that peak accuracy is when using data from +75 to +125 ms relative to the object appearing on screen. We discuss the use of such classification and potential cognitive implications of differential accuracy on IC activations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Atomic descriptors were based on atom types (defined by the element and number of neighbour atoms) and topological interatomic distances (number of bonds), so that predictions do not require 3D structures and can be calculated very rapidly. Separate models were built for hydrogen atoms (12,541 atoms in the training set) and non-hydrogen atoms (22,764 atoms in the training set). The best results were achieved with feed-forward neural networks comprising 136 or 155 input neurons (for H atoms and non-H atoms, respectively) and 6 hidden neurons. Predictions for 4178 H atoms and 7587 non-H atoms in independent test sets were obtained with Q(2) = 0.987/RMSE = 0.0080/MAE = 0.0054 and Q(2) = 0.996/RMSE = 0.0273/MAE = 0.0182, respectively. The results show how QSPR approaches can provide fast access to accurate estimations of DFT-NBO charges. Such high-level theoretical quantum calculations can thus be used in large-scale applications that otherwise would not afford the intrinsic computational cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, the biomarker signatures used for model construction were derived from individual high-throughput techniques, such as microarrays designed for monitoring global mRNA expression. In this study, we built predictive models by integrating omics data across complementary microarray platforms and introduced new concepts for modeling of pathway alterations and molecular interactions between multiple biological layers. We trained and evaluated diverse machine learning-based models, differing in the incorporated features and learning algorithms on a cross-omics dataset encompassing mRNA, miRNA, and protein expression profiles obtained from rat liver samples treated with a heterogeneous set of substances. Most of these compounds could be unambiguously classified as genotoxic carcinogens, non-genotoxic carcinogens, or non-hepatocarcinogens based on evidence from published studies. Since mixed characteristics were reported for the compounds Cyproterone acetate, Thioacetamide, and Wy-14643, we reclassified these compounds as either genotoxic or non-genotoxic carcinogens based on their molecular profiles. Evaluating our toxicogenomics models in a repeated external cross-validation procedure, we demonstrated that the prediction accuracy of our models could be increased by joining the biomarker signatures across multiple biological layers and by adding complex features derived from cross-platform integration of the omics data. Furthermore, we found that adding these features resulted in a better separation of the compound classes and a more confident reclassification of the three undefined compounds as non-genotoxic carcinogens.

They can be used to project physiological and agronomic processes; regarding this fact, agronomic traits such as yield can be affected by a large number of variables. In this study, we analyzed a large number of physiological and agronomic traits by screening, clustering, and decision tree models to select the most relevant factors for the prospect of accurately increasing maize grain yield. Decision tree models (with nearly the same performance evaluation) were the most useful tools in understanding the underlying relationships in physiological and agronomic features for selecting the most important and relevant traits (sowing date-location, kernel number per ear, maximum water content, kernel weight, and season duration) corresponding to the maize grain yield. In particular, decision tree generated by C&RT algorithm was the best model for yield prediction based on physiological and agronomical traits which can be extensively employed in future breeding programs. No significant differences in the decision tree models were found when feature selection filtering on data were used, but positive feature selection effect observed in clustering models. Finally, the results showed that the proposed model techniques are useful tools for crop physiologists to search through large datasets seeking patterns for the physiological and agronomic factors, and may assist the selection of the most important traits for the individual site and field. In particular, decision tree models are method of choice with the capability of illustrating different pathways of yield increase in breeding programs, governed by their hierarchy structure of feature ranking as well as pattern discovery via various combinations of features.

Efficient discovery of responses of proteins to compounds using active learning	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Active learning; Machine learning; Drug development; Polypharmacology; Computational biology; Drug discovery	THROUGHPUT SCREENING DATA; PUBCHEM; DOCKING; EXPERIMENTATION; DESCRIPTORS; REGRESSION; SELECTION; PLATFORM; TARGETS; DESIGN	Background: Drug discovery and development has been aided by high throughput screening methods that detect compound effects on a single target. However, when using focused initial screening, undesirable secondary effects are often detected late in the development process after significant investment has been made. An alternative approach would be to screen against undesired effects early in the process, but the number of possible secondary targets makes this prohibitively expensive. Results: This paper describes methods for making this global approach practical by constructing predictive models for many target responses to many compounds and using them to guide experimentation. We demonstrate for the first time that by jointly modeling targets and compounds using descriptive features and using active machine learning methods, accurate models can be built by doing only a small fraction of possible experiments. The methods were evaluated by computational experiments using a dataset of 177 assays and 20,000 compounds constructed from the PubChem database. Conclusions: An average of nearly 60% of all hits in the dataset were found after exploring only 3% of the experimental space which suggests that active learning can be used to enable more complete characterization of compound effects than otherwise affordable. The methods described are also likely to find widespread application outside drug discovery, such as for characterizing the effects of a large number of compounds or inhibitory RNAs on a large number of cell or tissue phenotypes.

A large number of high quality question and answer pairs have been accumulated, which allow users to not only share their knowledge with others, but also interact with each other. Accordingly, volumes of efforts have been taken to explore the questions and answers retrieval in CQA services so as to help users to finding the similar questions or the right answers. However, to our knowledge, less attention has been paid so far to question popularity in CQA. Question popularity can reflect the attention and interest of users. Hence, predicting question popularity can better capture the users' interest so as to improve the users' experience. Meanwhile, it can also promote the development of the community. In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting question popularity in CQA. We first explore the factors that have impact on question popularity by employing statistical analysis. We then propose a supervised machine learning approach to model these factors for question popularity prediction. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively distinguish the popular questions from unpopular ones in the Yahoo! Answers question and answer repository.

Using innovative statistical methods we compared genotype distributions and interactions of EPAS1 SNPs rs1867785, rs11689011, rs895436, rs4035887 and rs1867782 between sprint/power athletes (n = 338), endurance athletes (n = 254), and controls (603) in Polish and Russian samples. We also examined the association between these SNPs and the athletes' competition level ('elite' and 'sub-elite' level). Genotyping was performed by either Real-Time PCR or by Single-Base Extension (SBE) method. Results: In the pooled cohort of Polish and Russian athletes, 1) rs1867785 was associated with sprint/power athletic status; the AA genotype in rs1867785 was underrepresented in the sprint/power athletes, 2) rs11689011 was also associated with sprint/power athletic status; the TT genotype in rs11689011 was underrepresented sprint/power athletes, and 3) the interaction between rs1867785, rs11689011, and rs4035887 was associated with sprint/power athletic performance; the combinations of the AA genotype in rs4035887 with either the AG or GG genotypes in rs1867785, or with the CT or CC genotypes in rs11689011, were underrepresented in two cohorts of sprint/power athletes. Conclusions: Based on the unique statistical model rs1867785/rs11689011 are strong predictors of sprint/power athletic status, and the interaction between rs1867785, rs11689011, and rs4035887 might contribute to success in sprint/power athletic performance.

While the general layout of labeled neurites can be captured by many automated tracing algorithms, it is often not possible to differentiate reliably between the processes belonging to different cells. The reason is that some neurites in the stack may appear broken due to imperfect labeling, while others may appear fused due to the limited resolution of optical microscopy. Trained neuroanatomists routinely resolve such topological ambiguities during manual tracing tasks by combining information about distances between branches, branch orientations, intensities, calibers, tortuosities, colors, as well as the presence of spines or boutons. Likewise, to evaluate different topological scenarios automatically, we developed a machine learning approach that combines many of the above mentioned features. A specifically designed confidence measure was used to actively train the algorithm during user-assisted tracing procedure. Active learning significantly reduces the training time and makes it possible to obtain less than 1% generalization error rates by providing few training examples. To evaluate the overall performance of the algorithm a number of image stacks were reconstructed automatically, as well as manually by several trained users, making it possible to compare the automated traces to the baseline inter-user variability. Several geometrical and topological features of the traces were selected for the comparisons. These features include the total trace length, the total numbers of branch and terminal points, the affinity of corresponding traces, and the distances between corresponding branch and terminal points. Our results show that when the density of labeled neurites is sufficiently low, automated traces are not significantly different from manual reconstructions obtained by trained users.

From sequence to enzyme mechanism using multi-label machine learning	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							CATALYTIC SITE ATLAS; PROTEIN DATA-BANK; FAMILY CLASSIFICATION; DATABASE; RESOURCE; ANNOTATION; PREDICTION; INTERPRO; MACIE; 3D	Background: In this work we predict enzyme function at the level of chemical mechanism, providing a finer granularity of annotation than traditional Enzyme Commission (EC) classes. Hence we can predict not only whether a putative enzyme in a newly sequenced organism has the potential to perform a certain reaction, but how the reaction is performed, using which cofactors and with susceptibility to which drugs or inhibitors, details with important consequences for drug and enzyme design. Work that predicts enzyme catalytic activity based on 3D protein structure features limits the prediction of mechanism to proteins already having either a solved structure or a close relative suitable for homology modelling. Results: In this study, we evaluate whether sequence identity, InterPro or Catalytic Site Atlas sequence signatures provide enough information for bulk prediction of enzyme mechanism. By splitting MACiE (Mechanism, Annotation and Classification in Enzymes database) mechanism labels to a finer granularity, which includes the role of the protein chain in the overall enzyme complex, the method can predict at 96% accuracy (and 96% micro-averaged precision, 99.9% macro-averaged recall) the MACiE mechanism definitions of 248 proteins available in the MACiE, EzCatDb (Database of Enzyme Catalytic Mechanisms) and SFLD (Structure Function Linkage Database) databases using an off-the-shelf K-Nearest Neighbours multi-label algorithm. Conclusion: We find that InterPro signatures are critical for accurate prediction of enzyme mechanism. We also find that incorporating Catalytic Site Atlas attributes does not seem to provide additional accuracy.

Land-use/cover classification in a heterogeneous coastal landscape using RapidEye imagery: evaluating the performance of random forest and support vector machines classifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							HYPERION HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; CYPERUS-PAPYRUS L.; COVER CHANGE; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; ESTUARINE SYSTEM; DECISION TREES; SATELLITE DATA	Mapping of patterns and spatial distribution of land-use/cover (LULC) has long been based on remotely sensed data. In the recent past, efforts to improve the reliability of LULC maps have seen a proliferation of image classification techniques. Despite these efforts, derived LULC maps are still often judged to be of insufficient quality for operational applications, due to disagreement between generated maps and reference data. In this study we sought to pursue two objectives: first, to test the new-generation multispectral RapidEye imagery classification output using machine-learning random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers in a heterogeneous coastal landscape; and second, to determine the importance of different RapidEye bands on classification output. Accuracy of the derived thematic maps was assessed by computing confusion matrices of the classifiers' cover maps with respective independent validation data sets. An overall classification accuracy of 93.07% with a kappa value of 0.92, and 91.80 with a kappa value of 0.92 was achieved using RF and SVM, respectively. In this study, RF and SVM classifiers performed comparatively similarly as demonstrated by the results of McNemer's test (Z=1.15). An evaluation of different RapidEye bands using the two classifiers showed that incorporation of the red-edge band has a significant effect on the overall classification accuracy in vegetation cover types. Consequently, pursuit of high classification accuracy using high-spatial resolution imagery on complex landscapes remains paramount.

In this article, we design a novel probabilistic cluster structure ensemble framework, referred to as Gaussian mixture model based cluster structure ensemble framework (GMMSE), to identify the most representative cluster structure from the dataset. Specifically, GMMSE first applies the bagging approach to produce a set of variant datasets. Then, a set of Gaussian mixture models are used to capture the underlying cluster structures of the datasets. GMMSE applies K-means to initialize the values of the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model, and adopts the Expectation Maximization approach (EM) to estimate the parameter values of the model. Next, the components of the Gaussian mixture models are viewed as new data samples which are used to construct the representative matrix capturing the relationships among components. The similarity between two components corresponding to their respective Gaussian distributions is measured by the Bhattycharya distance function. Afterwards, GMMSE constructs a graph based on the new data samples and the representative matrix, and searches for the most representative cluster structure. Finally, we also design four criteria to assign the data samples to their corresponding clusters based on the unified cluster structure. The experimental results show that (i) GMMSE works well on synthetic datasets and real datasets in the UCI machine learning repository. (ii) GMMSE outperforms most of the previous cluster ensemble approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Range-Adaptive Standoff Recognition of Explosive Fingerprints on Solid Surfaces using a Supervised Learning Method and Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							EMISSION-SPECTRA; RESIDUES; LIBS	The distance between the sensor and the target is a particularly critical factor for an issue as crucial as explosive residues recognition when a laser-assisted spectroscopic technique operates in a standoff configuration. Particularly for laser ablation, variations in operational range influence the induced plasmas as well as the sensitivity of their ensuing optical emissions, thereby confining the attributes used in sorting methods. Though efficient classification models based on optical emissions gathered under specific conditions have been developed, their successful performance on any variable information is limited. Hence, to test new information by a designed model, data must be acquired under operational conditions totally matching those used during modeling. Otherwise, the new expected scenario needs to be previously modeled. To facing both this restriction and this time-consuming mission, a novel strategy is proposed in this work. On the basis of machine learning methods, the strategy stems from a decision boundary function designed for a defined set of experimental conditions. Next, particular semisupervised models to the envisaged conditions obtained adaptively on the basis of changes in laser fluence and light emission with variation of the sensor-to-target distance. Hence, the strategy requires only a little prior information, therefore ruling out the tedious and timeconsuming process of modeling all the expected distant scenes. Residues of ordinary materials (olive oil, fuel oil, motor oils, gasoline, car wax and hand cream) hardly cause confusion in alerting the presence of an explosive (DNT, TNT, RDX, or PETN) when tested within a range from 30 to SO m with varying laser irradiance between 8.2 and 1.3 GW cm(-2). With error rates of around 596, the experimental assessments confirm that this semisupervised model suitably addresses the recognition of organic residues on aluminum surfaces under different operational conditions.

J	Cao, C; Moult, J				Cao, Chen; Moult, John			GWAS and drug targets	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; INTERACTION DATABASE; KAWASAKI-DISEASE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HUMAN GENES; HYPERTENSION; NETWORK; DEFICIENCY; EVOLUTION	Background: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed a large number of links between genome variation and complex disease. Among other benefits, it is expected that these insights will lead to new therapeutic strategies, particularly the identification of new drug targets. In this paper, we evaluate the power of GWAS studies to find drug targets by examining how many existing drug targets have been directly 'rediscovered' by this technique, and the extent to which GWAS results may be leveraged by network information to discover known and new drug targets. Results: We find that only a very small fraction of drug targets are directly detected in the relevant GWAS studies. We investigate two possible explanations for this observation. First, we find evidence of negative selection acting on drug target genes as a consequence of strong coupling with the disease phenotype, so reducing the incidence of SNPs linked to the disease. Second, we find that GWAS genes are substantially longer on average than drug targets and than all genes, suggesting there is a length related bias in GWAS results. In spite of the low direct relationship between drug targets and GWAS reported genes, we found these two sets of genes are closely coupled in the human protein network. As a consequence, machine-learning methods are able to recover known drug targets based on network context and the set of GWAS reported genes for the same disease. We show the approach is potentially useful for identifying drug repurposing opportunities. Conclusions: Although GWA studies do not directly identify most existing drug targets, there are several reasons to expect that new targets will nevertheless be discovered using these data. Initial results on drug repurposing studies using network analysis are encouraging and suggest directions for future development.

A number of machine learning methods that allow a classification of stability changes knowing only the sequence of the protein emerged. However, their performance on amino acid substitutions of previously unseen non-homologous proteins is rather limited. Moreover, the performance varies for different types of mutations based on the secondary structure or accessible surface area of the mutation site. Results: We proposed feature-based multiple models with each model designed for a specific type of mutations. The new method is composed of five models trained for mutations in exposed, buried, helical, sheet, and coil residues. The classification of a mutation as stabilising or destabilising is made as a consensus of two models, one selected based on the predicted accessible surface area and the other based on the predicted secondary structure of the mutation site. We refer to our new method as Evolutionary, Amino acid, and Structural Encodings with Multiple Models (EASE-MM). Cross-validation results show that EASE-MM provides a notable improvement to our previous work reaching a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.44. EASE-MM was able to correctly classify 73% and 75% of stabilising and destabilising protein variants, respectively. Using an independent test set of 238 mutations, we confirmed our results in a comparison with related work. Conclusions: EASE-MM not only outperformed other related methods but achieved more balanced results for different types of mutations based on the accessible surface area, secondary structure, or magnitude of stability changes. This can be attributed to using multiple models with the most relevant features selected for the given type of mutations. Therefore, our results support the presumption that different interactions govern stability changes in the exposed and buried residues or in residues with a different secondary structure.

Reliable identification of protein-RNA interfaces is critical for understanding the structural bases and functional implications of such interactions and for developing effective approaches to rational drug design. Sequence-based computational methods offer a viable, cost-effective way to identify putative RNA-binding residues in RNA-binding proteins. Here we report two novel approaches: (i) HomPRIP, a sequence homology-based method for predicting RNA-binding sites in proteins; (ii) RNABindRPlus, a new method that combines predictions from HomPRIP with those from an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a benchmark dataset of 198 RNA-binding proteins. Although highly reliable, HomPRIP cannot make predictions for the unaligned parts of query proteins and its coverage is limited by the availability of close sequence homologs of the query protein with experimentally determined RNA-binding sites. RNABindRPlus overcomes these limitations. We compared the performance of HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus with that of several state-of-the-art predictors on two test sets, RB44 and RB111. On a subset of proteins for which homologs with experimentally determined interfaces could be reliably identified, HomPRIP outperformed all other methods achieving an MCC of 0.63 on RB44 and 0.83 on RB111. RNABindRPlus was able to predict RNA-binding residues of all proteins in both test sets, achieving an MCC of 0.55 and 0.37, respectively, and outperforming all other methods, including those that make use of structure-derived features of proteins. More importantly, RNABindRPlus outperforms all other methods for any choice of tradeoff between precision and recall. An important advantage of both HomPRIP and RNABindRPlus is that they rely on readily available sequence and sequence-derived features of RNA-binding proteins. A webserver implementation of both methods is freely available at http://einstein.cs.iastate.edu/RNABindRPlus/.

Markov mean properties for cell death-related protein classification	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Markov Chains; Cell Death; Protein classification; QSAR; Machine Learning	MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH; COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY; TOPOLOGICAL INDEXES; WEB SERVER; BINDING PROTEINS; B INHIBITORS; MARCH-INSIDE; QSAR MODELS; 3D; RECOGNITION	The cell death (CD) is a dynamic biological function involved in physiological and pathological processes. Due to the complexity of CD, there is a demand for fast theoretical methods that can help to find new CD molecular targets. The current work presents the first classification model to predict CD-related proteins based on Markov Mean Properties. These protein descriptors have been calculated with the MInD-Prot tool using the topological information of the amino acid contact networks of the 2423 protein chains, five atom physicochemical properties and the protein 3D regions. The Machine Learning algorithms from Weka were used to find the best classification model for CD-related protein chains using all 20 attributes. The most accurate algorithm to solve this problem was K*. After several feature subset methods, the best model found is based on only 11 variables and is characterized by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.992 and the true positive rate (TP Rate) of 88.2% (validation set). 7409 protein chains labeled with "unknown function" in the PDB Databank were analyzed with the best model in order to predict the CD-related biological activity. Thus, several proteins have been predicted to have CD-related function in Homo sapiens: 3DRX-involved in virus-host interaction biological process, protein homooligomerization; 4DWF-involved in cell differentiation, chromatin modification, DNA damage response, protein stabilization; 1IUR-involved in ATP binding, chaperone binding; 1J7D-involved in DNA double-strand break processing, histone ubiquitination, nucleotide-binding oligomerization; 1UTU-linked with DNA repair, regulation of transcription; 3EEC-participating to the cellular membrane organization, egress of virus within host cell, class mediator resulting in cell cycle arrest, negative regulation of ubiquitin-protein ligase activity involved in mitotic cell cycle and apoptotic process. Other proteins from bacteria predicted as CD-related are 2G3V - a CAG pathogenicity island protein 13 from Helicobacter pylori, 4G5A - a hypothetical protein in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 1YLK-involved in the nitrogen metabolism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and 1XSV - with possible DNA/RNA binding domains. The results demonstrated the possibility to predict CD-related proteins using molecular information encoded into the protein 3D structure. Thus, the current work demonstrated the possibility to predict new molecular targets involved in cell-death processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

How to represent crystal structures for machine learning: Towards fast prediction of electronic properties	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							HIGH-THROUGHPUT; INITIO; BATTERIES; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	High-throughput density functional calculations of solids are highly time-consuming. As an alternative, we propose a machine learning approach for the fast prediction of solid-state properties. To achieve this, local spin-density approximation calculations are used as a training set. We focus on predicting the value of the density of electronic states at the Fermi energy. We find that conventional representations of the input data, such as the Coulomb matrix, are not suitable for the training of learning machines in the case of periodic solids. We propose a novel crystal structure representation for which learning and competitive prediction accuracies become possible within an unrestricted class of spd systems of arbitrary unit-cell size.

Online tracking of the contents of conscious perception using real-time fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anorthoscopic; bistable perception; ambiguous stimulus; real-time fMRI; object integration; slit viewing	HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; SHAPE PERCEPTION; CORTICAL REGIONS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; PATTERNS; RECOGNITION	Perception is an active process that interprets and structures the stimulus input based on assumptions about its possible causes. We use real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) to investigate a particularly powerful demonstration of dynamic object integration in which the same physical stimulus intermittently elicits categorically different conscious object percepts. In this study, we simulated an outline object that is moving behind a narrow slit. With such displays, the physically identical stimulus can elicit categorically different percepts that either correspond closely to the physical stimulus (vertically moving line segments) or represent a hypothesis about the underlying cause of the physical stimulus (a horizontally moving object that is partly occluded). In the latter case, the brain must construct an object from the input sequence. Combining rtfMRI with machine learning techniques we show that it is possible to determine online the momentary state of a subject's conscious percept from time resolved BOLD-activity. In addition, we found that feedback about the currently decoded percept increased the decoding rates compared to prior fMRI recordings of the same stimulus without feedback presentation. The analysis of the trained classifier revealed a brain network that discriminates contents of conscious perception with antagonistic interactions between early sensory areas that represent physical stimulus properties and higher-tier brain areas. During integrated object percepts, brain activity decreases in early sensory areas and increases in higher-tier areas. We conclude that it is possible to use BOLD responses to reliably track the contents of conscious visual perception with a relatively high temporal resolution. We suggest that our approach can also be used to investigate the neural basis of auditory object formation and discuss the results in the context of predictive coding theory.

The combination of ADC and other pictorial characteristics has improved lesion type identification accuracy. The objective of this study was to reassess the findings on an independent patient group by changing the magnetic field from 1.5-Tesla to 3.0-Tesla. Methods: This retrospective study consisted of a training group of 234 female patients, including 85 benign and 149 malignant lesions, imaged using 1.5-Tesla MRI, and a test group of 95 female patients, including 19 benign and 85 malignant lesions, imaged using 3.0-Tesla MRI. The lesion of interest was segmented from the raw image and four sets of measurements describing the morphology, kinetics, DW-MRI, and texture of the pictorial properties of each lesion were obtained. Each lesion was characterized by 28 features in total. Three classical machine-learning algorithms were used to build prediction models on the training group, which evaluated the prognostic performance of the multi-sided features in three scenarios. To reduce information redundancy, five highly diagnostic factors were selected to obtain a compact yet informative characterization of the lesion status. Results: Three classification models were built on the training of 1.5-Tesla patients and were tested on the independent 3.0-Tesla test group. The following results were found. i) Characterization of breast masses in a multi-sided way dramatically increased prediction performance. The usage of all features gave a higher performance in both sensitivity and specificity than any individual feature groups or their combinations. ii) ADC was a highly effective factor in improving the sensitivity in discriminating malignant from benign masses. iii) Five features, namely ADC, Sum Average, Entropy, Elongation, and Sum Variance, were selected to achieve the highest performance in diagnosis of the 3.0-Tesla patient group. Conclusions: The combination of ADC and other multi-sided characteristics can increase the capability of discriminating malignant and benign breast lesions, even under different imaging protocols. The selected compact feature subsets achieved a high diagnostic performance and thus are promising in clinical applications for discriminating lesion type and for personalized treatment planning.

The vector of variables is partitioned into two blocks, and we assume that the objective function is convex with respect to a block-component. Problems with this structure arise, for instance, in machine learning. In order to advantageously exploit the structure of the objective function and to take into account that the number of terms of the objective function may be huge, we propose a decomposition algorithm combined with a gradient incremental strategy. Global convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved. The results of computational experiments performed on large-scale real problems show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to existing algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Extinction risk modelling can identify correlates of risk and species not yet recognized to be threatened. Here, we use machine learning models to identify correlates of extinction risk in African terrestrial mammals using a set of variables belonging to four classes: species distribution state, human pressures, conservation response and species biology. We derived information on distribution state and human pressure from satellite-borne imagery. Variables in all four classes were identified as important predictors of extinction risk, and interactions were observed among variables in different classes (e.g. level of protection, human threats, species distribution ranges). Species biology had a key role in mediating the effect of external variables. The model was 90% accurate in classifying extinction risk status of species, but in a few cases the observed and modelled extinction risk mismatched. Species in this condition might suffer from an incorrect classification of extinction risk (hence require reassessment). An increased availability of satellite imagery combined with improved resolution and classification accuracy of the resulting maps will play a progressively greater role in conservation monitoring.

In this work 2D topological fingerprints are used to encode atomic sites and three probabilistic machine learning methods are applied: Parzen-Rosenblatt Window (PRW), Naive Bayesian (NB) and a novel approach called RASCAL (Random Attribute Subsampling Classification ALgorithm). These are implemented by randomly subsampling descriptor space to alleviate the problem often suffered by data mining methods of having to exactly match fingerprints, and in the case of PRW by measuring a distance between feature vectors rather than exact matching. The classifiers have been implemented in CUDA/C++ to exploit the parallel architecture of graphical processing units (GPUs) and is freely available in a public repository. Results: It is shown that for PRW a SoM (Site of Metabolism) is identified in the top two predictions for 85%, 91% and 88% of the CYP 3A4, 2D6 and 2C9 data sets respectively, with RASCAL giving similar performance of 83%, 91% and 88%, respectively. These results put PRW and RASCAL performance ahead of NB which gave a much lower classification performance of 51%, 73% and 74%, respectively. Conclusions: 2D topological fingerprints calculated to a bond depth of 4-6 contain sufficient information to allow the identification of SoMs using classifiers based on relatively small data sets. Thus, the machine learning methods outlined in this paper are conceptually simpler and more efficient than other methods tested and the use of simple topological descriptors derived from 2D structure give results competitive with other approaches using more expensive quantum chemical descriptors. The descriptor space subsampling approach and ensemble methodology allow the methods to be applied to molecules more distant from the training data where data mining would be more likely to fail due to the lack of common fingerprints. The RASCAL algorithm is shown to give equivalent classification performance to PRW but at lower computational expense allowing it to be applied more efficiently in the ensemble scheme.

J	Jun, S; Park, SS; Jang, DS				Jun, Sunghae; Park, Sang-Sung; Jang, Dong-Sik			Document clustering method using dimension reduction and support vector clustering to overcome sparseness	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Document clustering; Sparseness problem; Patent clustering; Dimension reduction; K-means clustering based on support vector clustering; Silhouette measure	PATENT ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; TRENDS; INVENTION; PLATFORM; NETWORK; INDIA; MAP	Many studies on developing technologies have been published as articles, papers, or patents. We use and analyze these documents to find scientific and technological trends. In this paper, we consider document clustering as a method of document data analysis. In general, we have trouble analyzing documents directly because document data are not suitable for statistical and machine learning methods of analysis. Therefore, we have to transform document data into structured data for analytical purposes. For this process, we use text mining techniques. The structured data are very sparse, and hence, it is difficult to analyze them. This study proposes a new method to overcome the sparsity problem of document clustering. We build a combined clustering method using dimension reduction and K-means clustering based on support vector clustering and Silhouette measure. In particular, we attempt to overcome the sparseness in patent document clustering. To verify the efficacy of our work, we first conduct an experiment using news data from the machine learning repository of the University of California at Irvine. Second, using patent documents retrieved from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we carry out patent clustering for technology forecasting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ghazanfar, MA; Prugel-Bennett, A				Ghazanfar, Mustansar Ali; Pruegel-Bennett, Adam			Leveraging clustering approaches to solve the gray-sheep users problem in recommender systems	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Gray-sheep users; Recommender systems; Collaborative filtering; K-Means clustering	K-MEANS; CLASSIFIERS	Recommender systems apply data mining and machine learning techniques for filtering unseen information and can predict whether a user would like a given item. This paper focuses on gray-sheep users problem responsible for the increased error rate in collaborative filtering based recommender systems. This paper makes the following contributions: we show that (1) the presence of gray-sheep users can affect the performance - accuracy and coverage - of the collaborative filtering based algorithms, depending on the data sparsity and distribution; (2) gray-sheep users can be identified using clustering algorithms in offline fashion, where the similarity threshold to isolate these users from the rest of community can be found empirically. We propose various improved centroid selection approaches and distance measures for the K-means clustering algorithm; (3) content-based profile of gray-sheep users can be used for making accurate recommendations. We offer a hybrid recommendation algorithm to make reliable recommendations for gray-sheep users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a formal solution for gray-sheep users problem. By extensive experimental results on two different datasets (MovieLens and community of movie fans in the FilmTrust website), we showed that the proposed approach reduces the recommendation error rate for the gray-sheep users while maintaining reasonable computational performance.

J	Yeow, WL; Mahmud, R; Raj, RG				Yeow, Wei Liang; Mahmud, Rohana; Raj, Ram Gopal			An application of case-based reasoning with machine learning for forensic autopsy	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Case-based reasoning; Naive Bayes; Autopsy report system; Decision-support system; Feature-weight learning	BAYESIAN NETWORKS; CRIME ANALYSIS; INTELLIGENCE; METHODOLOGY; SCIENCE; MODEL	Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving. CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations. However, CBR is relatively new in the field of forensic science. Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases, the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge. This paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences. The design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System (I-AuReSys) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results are presented. Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Naive Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation. Our experimental results reveal that the CBR method with the implementation of a learner is indeed a viable alternative method to the forensic methods with practical advantages.

Differential Evolution Extreme Learning Machine for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Differential evolution (DE); extreme learning machine (ELM); feature extraction; hyperspectral images	SPECTRAL-SPATIAL CLASSIFICATION; GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION; CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATION; FUSION	Recently, a new machine learning approach that is termed as the extreme learning machine (ELM) has been introduced in the literature. This approach is characterized by a unified formulation for regression, binary, and multiclass classification problems, and the related solution is given in an analytical compact form. In this letter, we propose an efficient classification method for hyperspectral images based on this machine learning approach. To address the model selection issue that is associated with the ELM, we develop an automatic-solution-based differential evolution (DE). This simple yet powerful evolutionary optimization algorithm uses cross-validation accuracy as a performance indicator for determining the optimal ELM parameters. Experimental results obtained from four benchmark hyperspectral data sets confirm the attractive properties of the proposed DE-ELM method in terms of classification accuracy and computation time.

J	Apartsin, A; Cooper, LN; Intrator, N				Apartsin, Alexander; Cooper, Leon N.; Intrator, Nathan			Time-of-Flight Estimation in the Presence of Outliers Part I-Single Echo Processing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Biosonar; sonar; threshold effect; time-of-flight (ToF) estimation	WIDE-BAND BIOSONAR; SONAR; ACCURACY; MODEL	When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) falls below a certain level, the error of the time-of-flight (ToF) maximum likelihood estimator abruptly increases due to the well-known threshold effect. Nevertheless, operating near and below the threshold SNR value might be necessary for many remote sensing applications due to power-related constraints. These constraints may include a limit on the maximum power of a single source pulse or a limit on the total power used by multiple signals transmitted during a single measurement. For narrow-band signals, the threshold effect emerges mostly due to outliers induced by local maxima of the autocorrelation function of a source signal. Following the previously explored path of biosonar-inspired echo processing, this paper introduces a new method for ToF estimation in the presence of outliers. The proposed method employs a bank of phase-shifted unmatched filters for generating multiple biased but only partially correlated estimators (multiple experts). Using machine learning techniques, the information from the multiple experts is combined together for improving the near-the-threshold ToF estimation from a single echo.

The proposed model comprises two phases. In the first phase, each attribute is analyzed in the optimized sequence. The results of the analysis are then used as features that undergo reanalysis in the second phase, with the assumption that the relationship between the attributes is correlative. The experiments conducted showed that the proposed model improves user intention analysis over the baseline model, with an error reduction rate in Speech Act, Concept Sequence, and Arguments of 0.64%, 14.78%, and 5.84%, respectively.

PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Privileged information; Learning using privileged information (LUPI); Random features; Support Vector Machine (SVM); SVM	RECOGNITION	Learning using privileged information (LUPI) is a machine learning paradigm which aims at improving classification by taking advantage of information that is only available at training time -not at test time. SVM+ is an SVM-based implementation of LUPI. Despite this paradigm has potential interest for many applications, both LUPI and SVM+ have been scarcely explored up to date. In this work we report our effort in reproducing some results in the SVM+ literature and explore some practical issues of SVM+. The main finding is that just using randomly generated features as privileged information may perform similarly to using sensible (i.e. meaningful a priori) privileged information, at least in some problems.

This raises the issue of possible effects this coexistence might have on the performance of these networks. Negative effects are a consequence of contention for network resources (such as free wireless communication frequencies) between different devices, which can be avoided if co-located networks cooperate with each other and share the available resources. This paper presents a self-learning, cognitive cooperation approach for heterogeneous co-located networks. Cooperation is performed by activating or deactivating services such as interference avoidance, packet sharing, various MAC protocols, etc. Activation of a cooperative service might have both positive and negative effects on a network's performance, regarding its high level goals. Such a cooperation approach has to incorporate a reasoning mechanism, centralized or distributed, capable of determining the influence of each symbiotic service on the performance of all the participating sub-networks, taking into consideration their requirements. In this paper, a cooperation method incorporating a machine learning technique, known as the Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI), is proposed and discussed as a novel network cooperation paradigm.

This input-output relationship is usually deformed by a random noise. From experience, simulations, and special case theories, most practitioners believe that increasing the size of the training set improves the performance of the learning algorithm. It is shown that this phenomenon is not true in general for any pair of a learning algorithm and a data distribution. In particular, it is proven that for certain distributions and learning algorithms, increasing the training set size may result in a worse performance and increasing the training set size infinitely may result in the worst performance-even when there is no model misspecification for the input-output relationship. Simulation results and analysis of real datasets are provided to support the mathematical argument. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At the moment, those phenomena have been the root cause of short circuits and the most important cause of mal-operation of transmission line protection relays. Thus, this paper develops the classification of lightning transient signals with and without fault. Multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is used to analyze those signals considering five mother wavelets and different decomposition levels of three phase voltages. In this manner, Spectral Energy and Machine Learning as Artificial Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine are employed to classify those signals. On the other hand, the developed work in this paper analyzes most important parameters of lightning strokes, which are essentials in producing conditions with and without fault. Results show that the methodology presents an acceptable performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Morales, J.

The novelty detection approach is typically used when the quantity of available "abnormal" data is insufficient to construct explicit models for non-normal classes. Application includes inference in datasets from critical systems, where the quantity of available normal data is very large, such that "normality" may be accurately modelled. In this review we aim to provide an updated and structured investigation of novelty detection research papers that have appeared in the machine learning literature during the last decade.

Date maturity and quality evaluation using color distribution analysis and back projection	JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING			English	Article						Maturity evaluation; Color grading; Color histogram analysis; Back projection	BRUISE DETECTION; COMPUTER VISION; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; CHERRIES; APPLES	A new color grading method is proposed in this paper to provide an automatic and intuitive way of evaluating the maturity and quality of harvested dates. Different from other existing methods that rely on complicated machine learning or artificial intelligent algorithms, this method uses 2D histograms of colors in each grading category to determine the co-occurrence frequency. Based on this color analysis result, a mapping matrix is generated for back projecting the input colors of the fruit to their designated color indexes. The date color, which strongly correlates to maturity and quality, can then be graded by analyzing the resulting back projected color indexes. With the proposed method, the operator is allowed to set or adjust the cutoff points of different maturity or quality groups of date for automatic inspection. This paper uses Medjool date grading as an example to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It is suitable and can be easily adapted for other fruit or vegetable grading applications. The proposed method is proven accurate and user-friendly and has been implemented and used for commercial production for date maturity evaluation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we focus on the feature weighting problem in a specific machine learning area: multiple-instance learning, and propose maximum margin multiple-instance feature weighting (M3IFW) to seek large classification margins in the weighted feature space. The designed M3IFW algorithm can be applied to both standard binary-class multiple-instance learning and the corresponding multi-class learning, and we abbreviate them to B-M3IFW (binary-class M3IFW) and M-M3IFW (multi-class M3IFW), respectively. Both B-M3IFW and M-M3IFW contain three kinds of unknown variables, i.e., positive prototypes, classification margins, and weighting coefficients. We utilize the coordinate ascent algorithm to update the three kinds of unknown variables, respectively and iteratively, and then perform classifications in the weighted feature space. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of M3IFW in improving classification accuracies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Solving this problem requires the construction of a control strategy that will determine the actions for the AUV based on the current state, as measured by on-board sensors and the historic trajectory (including sensed data) of the AUV. We approach this task by applying plan-based policy-learning, in which a large set of sampled problems are solved using planning and then, from the resulting plans a decision-tree is learned, using an established machine-learning algorithm, which forms the resulting policy. We evaluate our approach in simulation and report on sea trials of a prototype of a learned policy. We indicate some of the lessons learned from this deployed system and further evaluate an extended policy in simulation.

Later its generalized version called Real AdaBoost was proposed by Schapire and Singer. Real AdaBoost increases weights for misclassified samples and decreases weights for correctly classified samples in every iteration. This kind of weight adjustment focuses on the samples with large weights and tries to make them correctly classified in future runs. However, it may lead to the misclassification of some other samples that have been correctly classified in previous runs. If we can curb this kind of misclassification during the boosting process, a faster training can be achieved. Based on this assumption, we propose Parameterized AdaBoost in which a parameter is devised to penalize the misclassification of samples that have already been correctly classified. Then we analyse that samples with positive classification margins in Parameterized AdaBoost are more than in Real Ada Boost. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a faster convergence of the training error and also improves the generalization error to some degree when compared with Real AdaBoost.

J	Johnson, HR				Johnson, Hunter R.			Some new maximum VC classes	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Combinatorial problems; Computational geometry; VC dimension	VAPNIK-CHERVONENKIS DIMENSION; SAMPLE COMPRESSION; SCHEMES	Set systems of finite VC dimension are frequently used in applications relating to machine learning theory and statistics. Two simple types of VC classes which have been widely studied are the maximum classes (those which are extremal with respect to Sauer's lemma) and so-called Dudley classes, which arise as sets of positivity for linearly parameterized functions. These two types of VC class were related by Floyd, who gave sufficient conditions for when a Dudley class is maximum. It is widely known that Floyd's condition applies to positive Euclidean half-spaces and certain other classes, such as sets of positivity for univariate polynomials. In this paper we show that Floyd's lemma applies to a wider class of linearly parameterized functions than has been formally recognized to date. In particular we show that, modulo some minor technicalities, the sets of positivity for any linear combination of real analytic functions is maximum on points in general position. This includes sets of positivity for multivariate polynomials as a special case. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the main drawback of SVM is that it generates "black box" model, i.e. it does not reveal the knowledge learnt during training in human comprehensible form. The process of converting such opaque models into a transparent model is often regarded as rule extraction. In this paper we proposed a hybrid approach for extracting rules from SVM for customer relationship management (CRM) purposes. The proposed hybrid approach consists of three phases. (i) During first phase; SVM-RFE (SVM-recursive feature elimination) is employed to reduce the feature set. (ii) Dataset with reduced features is then used in the second phase to obtain SVM model and support vectors are extracted. (iii) Rules are then generated using Naive Bayes Tree (NBTree) in the final phase. The dataset analyzed in this research study is about Churn prediction in bank credit card customer (Business Intelligence Cup 2004) and it is highly unbalanced with 93.24% loyal and 6.76% churned customers. Further we employed various standard balancing approaches to balance the data and extracted rules. It is observed from the empirical results that the proposed hybrid outperformed all other techniques tested. As the reduced feature dataset is used, it is also observed that the proposed approach extracts smaller length rules, thereby improving the comprehensibility of the system. The generated rules act as an early warning expert system to the bank management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Farquad, M. A.

SVMs introduced by Vapnik and others in the early 1990s are machine learning systems that utilize a hypothesis space of linear functions in a high dimensional feature space, trained with optimization algorithms that implements a learning bias derived from statistical learning theory. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art and focuses over a wide range of applications of SVMs in the field of hydrology. To use SVM aided hydrological models, which have increasingly extended during the last years; comprehensive knowledge about their theory and modelling approaches seems to be necessary. Furthermore, this review provides a brief synopsis of the techniques of SVMs and other emerging ones (hybrid models), which have proven useful in the analysis of the various hydrological parameters. Moreover, various examples of successful applications of SVMs for modelling different hydrological processes are also provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Information on growing stock is thus essential to understand dynamics of forest stands, their productive capacity and to manage their use within limits of sustainability. Dynamic changes of forest growing stock, as well as predictions of their future development, are usually estimated from the data gathered by national forest inventories using some mechanistic modelling approach. The resulting models are informative, but include many parameters, some of which are difficult to set or estimate. Due to the demanding parameterisation of mechanistic models, it is hard to achieve stability of their output accuracy, which can lower their predictive power. This paper presents an alternative and complementary approach of constructing models with machine learning and data mining methods. We applied these methods to the Silva-SI database and used the resulting interpretable models in order to find explanations for structural changes in Slovenian forests over the period from year 1970 to 2010. In addition, we developed predictive models for growing sock in the decade from year 2010 to 2020. The structure of the models describing temporal dynamics of growing stock shows that trends of growing stock are increasing for the entire studied period, while accumulation of growing stock is much more intensive after 1990. Forests with a lower growing stock are located either in the areas with non-favorable site conditions for forest growth, or at lower altitudes, where they are more exposed to human exploitation due to their vicinity to more densely populated regions. Predictions of growing stock for the decade 2010-2020 suggest that Slovenian forests will continue to accumulate their growing stock (private owned forests to 327 m(3)/ha and state owned forests to 343 m(3)/ha in 2020). The presented data mining approach that was here applied to the growing stock can also be used for investigating other ecological indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Properly categorized applications allow stakeholders to identify requirements related to their applications and predict maintenance problems in software projects. Manual categorization is expensive, tedious, and laborious - this is why automatic categorization approaches are gaining widespread importance. Unfortunately, for different legal and organizational reasons, the applications' source code is often not available, thus making it difficult to automatically categorize these applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which we use Application Programming Interface (API) calls from third-party libraries for automatic categorization of software applications that use these API calls. Our approach is general since it enables different categorization algorithms to be applied to repositories that contain both source code and bytecode of applications, since API calls can be extracted from both the source code and byte-code. We compare our approach to a state-of-the-art approach that uses machine learning algorithms for software categorization, and conduct experiments on two large Java repositories: an open-source repository containing 3,286 projects and a closed-source repository with 745 applications, where the source code was not available. Our contribution is twofold: we propose a new approach that makes it possible to categorize software projects without any source code using a small number of API calls as attributes, and furthermore we carried out a comprehensive empirical evaluation of automatic categorization approaches.

The SH3 domain of BCR-ABL is a small, conserved protein module that specifically recognizes and binds proline-rich peptide fragments. In the current study, we used a synthetic strategy to discover new peptide probes with high affinity binding to the BCR-ABL SH3 domain. In the procedure, a sequence-based machine learning predictor was developed based on a set of affinity-known SH3 binders, and the predictor was then used to guide the evolutional optimization of numerous virtual peptides to enrich high binding potency for the SH3 domain. Subsequently, a evolved peptide population was generated, from which ten peptides with the highest affinity scores were selected and their interaction free energies with SH3 domain were characterized systematically using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis. Consequently, four peptides were suggested as promising candidates and their affinities toward SH3 domain were assayed; two peptides, APTYTPPPPP and APTYAPPPPP, were identified to have potent binding capability with dissociation constants K (d) of 3 and 8 mu M, respectively. Further, the structural basis and energetic property of SH3 domain in complex with APTYTPPPPP were examined in detail, revealing a non-specific interaction in SH3-peptide recognition that should render a broad ligand spectrum for the domain.

We mapped indirect signs of Tetrao urogallus presence as well as habitat variables over a series of seven study areas in the Austrian Alps, situated on limestone and on silicate rock. We modelled habitat use of Tetrao urogallus with one parametric approach (binary logistic regression) and two machine learning classification algorithms (classification trees and random forests) for both geological substrata separately. All three modelling approaches performed equally well in terms of accuracy or predictive power, but differed in model calibration. Three variables significantly contributed to all three habitat models on limestone and on silicate substrate, respectively, i.e. the cover of field-layer, the cover of dwarf shrubs and the proportion of deciduous trees in forest stands on limestone and the cover of field-layer, the canopy cover and the occurrence of Abies alba and/or Pinus sylvestris in forest stands on silicate rock. Some variables like the cover of Rubus sp. appeared in several models, which are not frequently mentioned in other studies. There have been some explanatory variables, which would have been missed, when applying just one single modelling approach, for example the occurrence of forest edges, the availability of canopy gaps and the supply of ant hills. Our results suggest differing habitat management strategies on limestone and on silicate rock. Considering the large spatial requirements of Tetrao urogallus the necessity of active habitat management for Tetrao urogallus becomes obvious. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Learning surrogate models for simulation-based optimization	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						design (process simulation); optimization; machine learning	DERIVATIVE-FREE OPTIMIZATION; BLACK-BOX FUNCTIONS; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; ENGINEERING DESIGN; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; ASPEN	A central problem in modeling, namely that of learning an algebraic model from data obtained from simulations or experiments is addressed. A methodology that uses a small number of simulations or experiments to learn models that are as accurate and as simple as possible is proposed. The approach begins by building a low-complexity surrogate model. The model is built using a best subset technique that leverages an integer programming formulation to allow for the efficient consideration of a large number of possible functional components in the model. The model is then improved systematically through the use of derivative-free optimization solvers to adaptively sample new simulation or experimental points. Automated learning of algebraic models for optimization (ALAMO), the computational implementation of the proposed methodology, along with examples and extensive computational comparisons between ALAMO and a variety of machine learning techniques, including Latin hypercube sampling, simple least-squares regression, and the lasso is described.

J	Mohanty, SP; Kougianos, E				Mohanty, Saraju P.; Kougianos, Elias			Polynomial metamodel based fast optimization of nano-CMOS oscillator circuits	ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Mixed-signal circuits; Oscillator circuits; Polynomial metamodeling; Performance optimization; Optimization algorithms	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; ON-A-CHIP; EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION; RF ICS; DESIGN; ANALOG; SYSTEMS; SIMULATION	Modern consumer electronics are designed as analog/mixed-signal systems-on-chip (AMS-SoCs). In an AMS-SoC, the analog and mixed-signal portions have not received systematic attention due to their complex nature and the fact that their optimization and simulation consume significant portions of the design cycle time. This paper presents a new approach to reduce the design cycle time by combining accurate polynomial metamodels and optimization algorithms. The approach relies on a mathematical representation (metamodel or surrogate model) of AMSSoC subsystems/components. Polynomial metamodels are created from post-layout parasitic netlists and provide an accurate representation for each figure-of-merit over the entire design space of the AMS-SoC component. The metamodel approach saves a very significant amount of time during design iterations. Polynomial metamodels are reusable and language independent. Three algorithms are investigated to compare the speed for optimization on the polynomial metamodels. Two widely used circuits have been designed in two different technologies as comparative case studies: an 180 nm LC-VCO and a 45 nm ring oscillator (RO). Experimental results prove that the metamodel- based optimization achieved speed-up as high as 21,600 for the LC-VCO circuit and 11,750 for the RO in comparison to the actual circuit netlist-based (SPICE) optimization, with less than 1 % error. Thus, the paper demonstrates that the polynomial metamodeling approach to the design problem is an effective and accurate means for fast design space exploration and optimization.

Taylan; Sankur, Bulent			Probabilistic sequence clustering with spectral learning	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Machine learning; Spectral learning; Method of moments; Sequence clustering		In this paper, we derive two novel learning algorithms for time series clustering; namely for learning mixtures of Markov Models and mixtures of Hidden Markov Models. Mixture models are special latent variable models that require the usage of local search heuristics such as Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, that can only provide locally optimal solutions. In contrast, we make use of the spectral learning algorithms, recently popularized in the machine learning community. Under mild assumptions, spectral learning algorithms are able to estimate the parameters in latent variable models by solving systems of equations via eigendecompositions of matrices or tensors of observable moments. As such, spectral methods can be viewed as an instance of the method of moments for parameter estimation, an alternative to maximum likelihood. The popularity stems from the fact that these methods provide a computationally cheap and local optima free alternative to EM. We conduct classification experiments on human action sequences extracted from videos, clustering experiments on motion capture data and network traffic data to illustrate the viability of our approach. We conclude that the spectral methods are a practical and useful alternative in terms of computational effort and solution quality to standard iterative techniques such as EM in several sequence clustering applications.

Different machine learning-based techniques have been developed to infer the transportation mode based upon GPS data from such surveys. However, nearly none of these studies calculate the sample size required for validating these techniques. Since different surveys target different study areas for different temporal periods and different travel modes, identifying sample sizes for all transport modes at different spatio-temporal granularities is of imperative urgency given the high time and financial costs of CPS-based travel surveys. Here we use road network journey time data of London to calculate appropriate sample sizes for travel surveys designed either for a specific period-of-the-day, day-of-the-week or month-of-the-year. We also use different transportation analysis zones (central, inner and outer London) to demonstrate the spatial variability of the data over these different survey durations. Then we finally calculate and analyse the range of required sample sizes for different travel modes within these spatio-temporal granularities. This case study provides a good reference of sample size design for CPS-based travel survey in big cities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite this popularity not many researchers have attempted to study the use of these networks in anomaly detection or the implications of data anomalies on the outcome of such models. An abnormal change in the modelled environment's data at a given time, will cause a trailing chain effect on data of all related environment variables in current and consecutive time slices. Albeit this effect fades with time, it still can have an ill effect on the outcome of such models. In this paper we propose an algorithm for pilot error detection, using DBNs as the modelling framework for learning and detecting anomalous data. We base our experiments on the actions of an aircraft pilot, and a flight simulator is created for running the experiments. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm has achieved good results in detecting pilot errors and effects on the whole system.

In this work, we consider not just the broad effect of lecture capture technology on academic achievement between cohorts, but whether this effect is related to patterns of viewership among learners. At the centre of our interest is determining whether there are strategies learners take in their reviewing of content week-to-week that may result in better achievement. To investigate this, we describe a method for modelling learners based on their interactions with lecture capture systems. Unlike investigations done by others, our models emerge from the activities of the learners themselves, and are based on the results of applying unsupervised machine learning (clustering) techniques to student viewership data. These models describe five different classifications of learner interactions, and we show that one of these is positively correlated with academic achievement. We further validate our results through repeated experimentation, and describe how such models might be used by early-alert systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This dataset makes it possible to estimate a project's size, effort, duration, and cost. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine how and to what extent, ISBSG has been used by researchers from 2000, when the first papers were published, until June of 2012. Method: A systematic mapping review was used as the research method, which was applied to over 129 papers obtained after the filtering process. Results: The papers were published in 19 journals and 40 conferences. Thirty-five percent of the papers published between years 2000 and 2011 have received at least one citation in journals and only five papers have received six or more citations. Effort variable is the focus of 70.5% of the papers, 22.5% center their research in a variable different from effort and 7% do not consider any target variable. Additionally, in as many as 70.5% of papers, effort estimation is the research topic, followed by dataset properties (36.4%). The more frequent methods are Regression (61.2%), Machine Learning (35.7%), and Estimation by Analogy (22.5%). ISBSG is used as the only support in 55% of the papers while the remaining papers use complementary datasets. The ISBSG release 10 is used most frequently with 32 references. Finally, some benefits and drawbacks of the usage of ISBSG have been highlighted. Conclusion: This work presents a snapshot of the existing usage of ISBSG in software development research. ISBSG offers a wealth of information regarding practices from a wide range of organizations, applications, and development types, which constitutes its main potential. However, a data preparation process is required before any analysis. Lastly, the potential of ISBSG to develop new research is also outlined. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this article, we propose innovative and economic methods of generating knowledge-based structural metadata (structural keywords) using a combination of natural language processing-based machine-learning techniques and human intelligence. By allowing low-barrier participation through a social media system, scholars (both as authors and users) can participate in the metadata editing and enhancing process and benefit from more accurate and effective information retrieval. Our experimental web system ScholarWiki uses machine learning techniques, which automatically produce increasingly refined metadata by learning from the structural metadata contributed by scholars. The cumulated structural metadata add intelligence and automatically enhance and update recursively the quality of metadata, wiki pages, and the machine-learning model.

The method uses a trainable summarizer, which takes into account several features: the similarity of words among sentences, the similarity of words among paragraphs, the text format, cue-phrases, a score related to the frequency of terms in the whole document, the title, sentence location and the occurrence of non-essential information. The effect of each of these sentence features on the summarization task is investigated. These features are then used in combination to construct text summarizer models based on a maximum entropy model, a naive-Bayes classifier, and a support vector machine. To produce the final summary, the three models are combined into a hybrid model that ranks the sentences in order of importance. The performance of this new method has been tested using the DUC 2002 data corpus. The effectiveness of this technique is measured using the ROUGE score, and the results are promising when compared with some existing techniques.

Under SSL, large amounts of unlabeled data are used to assist the learning procedure to construct a more reasonable classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel manifold proximal support vector machine (MPSVM) for semi-supervised classification. By introducing discriminant information in the manifold regularization (MR), MPSVM not only introduces MR terms to capture as much geometric information as possible from inside the data, but also utilizes the maximum distance criterion to characterize the discrepancy between different classes, leading to the solution of a pair of eigenvalue problems. In addition, an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based model selection approach is suggested for MPSVM. Experimental results on several artificial as well as real-world datasets demonstrate that MPSVM obtains significantly better performance than supervised GEPSVM, and achieves comparable or better performance than LapSVM and LapTSVM, with better learning efficiency.

J	Kou, P; Gao, F				Kou, Peng; Gao, Feng			Sparse Gaussian Process regression model based on l(1/2) regularization	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Gaussian process; Sparse model; Regularization; Regression; Machine learning	CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Gaussian Process (GP) model is an elegant tool for the probabilistic prediction. However, the high computational cost of GP prohibits its practical application on large datasets. To address this issue, this paper develops a new sparse GP model, referred to as GPHalf. The key idea is to sparsify the GP model via the newly introduced a"" (1/2) regularization method. To achieve this, we represent the GP as a generalized linear regression model, then use the modified a"" (1/2) half thresholding algorithm to optimize the corresponding objective function, thus yielding a sparse GP model. We proof that the proposed model converges to a sparse solution. Numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Little, however, is known about its effect on the brain during a period in early childhood when anxiety-related traits begin to be reliably identifiable. Even less is known about the neurodevelopmental origins of individual differences in childhood anxiety. Methods: We combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging with neuropsychological assessments of anxiety based on daily life experiences to investigate the effects of anxiety on the brain in 76 young children. We then used machine learning algorithms with balanced cross-validation to examine brain-based predictors of individual differences in childhood anxiety. Results: Even in children as young as ages 7 to 9, high childhood anxiety is associated with enlarged amygdala volume and this enlargement is localized specifically to the basolateral amygdala. High childhood anxiety is also associated with increased connectivity between the amygdala and distributed brain systems involved in attention, emotion perception, and regulation, and these effects are most prominent in basolateral amygdala. Critically, machine learning algorithms revealed that levels of childhood anxiety could be reliably predicted by amygdala morphometry and intrinsic functional connectivity, with the left basolateral amygdala emerging as the strongest predictor. Conclusions: Individual differences in anxiety can be reliably detected with high predictive value in amygdala-centric emotion circuits at a surprisingly young age. Our study provides important new insights into the neurodevelopmental origins of anxiety and has significant implications for the development of predictive biomarkers to identify children at risk for anxiety disorders.

For reliable quality predictions, these objective quality measures need to respond consistently with the behavior of the human visual system (HVS). In practice, many important HVS mechanisms are too complex to be modeled directly. Instead, they can be mimicked by machine learning systems, trained on subjective quality assessment databases, and applied on predefined objective quality measures for specific content or distortion classes. On the downside, machine learning systems are often difficult to interpret and may even contradict the input objective quality measures, leading to unreliable quality predictions. To address this problem, we developed an interpretable machine learning system for objective quality assessment, namely the locally adaptive fusion (LAF). This paper describes the LAF system and compares its performance with traditional machine learning. As it turns out, the LAF system is more consistent with the input measures and can better handle heteroscedastic training data.

This is in part due to the ease with which data can now be shared/collected among entities sharing a common goal, task, or data source; and additionally the need to aggregate and make inferences about the collected information. This paper focuses on the development of probabilistic approaches for statistical learning in this setting. It specially considers the case when annotators may be unreliable, but also when their expertise vary depending on the data they observe. That is, annotators may have better knowledge about different parts of the input space and therefore be inconsistently accurate across the task domain. The models developed address both the supervised and the semi-supervised settings and produce classification and annotator models that allow us to provide estimates of the true labels and annotator expertise when no ground-truth is available. In addition, we provide an analysis of the proposed models, tasks, and related practical problems under various scenarios. In particular, we address how to evaluate annotators and how to consider cases where some ground-truth may be available. We show experimentally that annotator expertise can indeed vary in real tasks and that the presented approaches provide clear advantages over previously introduced multi-annotator methods, which only consider input-independent annotator characteristics, and over alternative approaches that do not model multiple annotators.

This work, based on a sample of over a third of a million users, examines how users' behaviour in the online environment, captured by their website choices and Facebook profile features, relates to their personality, as measured by the standard Five Factor Model personality questionnaire. Results show that there are psychologically meaningful links between users' personalities, their website preferences and Facebook profile features. We show how website audiences differ in terms of their personality, present the relationships between personality and Facebook profile features, and show how an individual's personality can be predicted from Facebook profile features. We conclude that predicting a user's personality profile can be applied to personalize content, optimize search results, and improve online advertising.

However, topic models are not perfect, and for many users in computational social science, digital humanities, and information studies-who are not machine learning experts-existing models and frameworks are often a "take it or leave it" proposition. This paper presents a mechanism for giving users a voice by encoding users' feedback to topic models as correlations between words into a topic model. This framework, interactive topic modeling (itm), allows untrained users to encode their feedback easily and iteratively into the topic models. Because latency in interactive systems is crucial, we develop more efficient inference algorithms for tree-based topic models. We validate the framework both with simulated and real users.

At the same time, as the economy and society move toward globalization, more organizations shift to distributed development of software projects. From this perspective, while adopting agile techniques seems beneficial, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed; among these notable is the effective cooperation between the stakeholders and the geographically distributed development team. In addition, data collection and validation for requirements engineering demands efficient processing techniques in order to handle the volume of data as well as to manage different inconsistencies, when the data are collected using online tools. In this paper, we present "PBURC," a patterns-based, unsupervised requirements clustering framework, which makes use of machine-learning methods for requirements validation, being able to overcome data inconsistencies and effectively determine appropriate requirements clusters for optimal definition of software development sprints.

A Meta-Cognitive Learning Algorithm for an Extreme Learning Machine Classifier	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Extreme learning machine; Meta-cognition; Classification; Self-regulatory learning mechanism; Hinge-loss error function	RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION; FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IMAGE QUALITY; RBF NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK; ELM; APPROXIMATION	This paper presents an efficient fast learning classifier based on the Nelson and Narens model of human meta-cognition, namely 'Meta-cognitive Extreme Learning Machine (McELM).' McELM has two components: a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component of McELM is a three-layered extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier. The neurons in the hidden layer of the cognitive component employ the q-Gaussian activation function, while the neurons in the input and output layers are linear. The meta-cognitive component of McELM has a self-regulatory learning mechanism that decides what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn in a meta-cognitive framework. As the samples in the training set are presented one-by-one, the meta-cognitive component receives the monitory signals from the cognitive component and chooses suitable learning strategies for the sample. Thus, it either deletes the sample, uses the sample to add a new neuron, or updates the output weights based on the sample, or reserves the sample for future use. Therefore, unlike the conventional ELM, the architecture of McELM is not fixed a priori, instead, the network is built during the training process. While adding a neuron, McELM chooses the centers based on the sample, and the width of the Gaussian function is chosen randomly. The output weights are estimated using the least square estimate based on the hinge-loss error function. The hinge-loss error function facilitates prediction of posterior probabilities better than the mean-square error and is hence preferred to develop the McELM classifier. While updating the network parameters, the output weights are updated using a recursive least square estimate. The performance of McELM is evaluated on a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. Performance study results highlight that meta-cognition in ELM framework enhances the decision-making ability of ELM significantly.

Multi-atlas based segmentation methods have attracted great interest due to their promising performance. Under the multi-atlas based segmentation framework, using deformation fields generated for registering atlas images onto a target image to be segmented, labels of the atlases are first propagated to the target image space and then fused to get the target image segmentation based on a label fusion strategy. While many label fusion strategies have been developed, most of these methods adopt predefined weighting models that are not necessarily optimal. In this study, we propose a novel local label learning strategy to estimate the target image's segmentation label using statistical machine learning techniques. In particular, we use a L1-regularized support vector machine (SVM) with a k nearest neighbor (kNN) based training sample selection strategy to learn a classifier for each of the target image voxel from its neighboring voxels in the atlases based on both image intensity and texture features. Our method has produced segmentation results consistently better than state-of-the-art label fusion methods in validation experiments on hippocampal segmentation of over 100 MR images obtained from publicly available and in-house datasets. Volumetric analysis has also demonstrated the capability of our method in detecting hippocampal volume changes due to Alzheimer's disease. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2674-2697, 2014.

A distinctive feature of NMF is its nonnegativity constraints that allow only additive linear combinations of the data, thus enabling it to learn parts that have distinct physical representations in reality. In this letter, we describe an information-theoretic approach to NMF for signal-dependent noise based on the generalized inverse gaussian model. Specifically, we propose three novel algorithms in this setting, each based on multiplicative updates, and prove monotonicity of updates using the EM algorithm. In addition, we develop algorithm-specific measures to evaluate their goodness of fit on data. Our methods are demonstrated using experimental data from electromyography studies, as well as simulated data in the extraction of muscle synergies, and compared with existing algorithms for signal-dependent noise.

Computational models replicating such human ability may contribute to the practical use of robots in daily human living environments; however, primarily because of scalability problems that conventional machine learning algorithms suffer from, sensory-motor information processing in robotic applications has typically been achieved via modal-dependent processes. In this paper, we propose a novel computational framework enabling the integration of sensory-motor time-series data and the self-organization of multimodal fused representations based on a deep learning approach. To evaluate our proposed model, we conducted two behavior-learning experiments utilizing a humanoid robot; the experiments consisted of object manipulation and bell-ringing tasks. From our experimental results, we show that large amounts of sensory-motor information, including raw RGB images, sound spectrums, and joint angles, are directly fused to generate higher-level multimodal representations. Further, we demonstrated that our proposed framework realizes the following three functions: (1) cross-modal memory retrieval utilizing the information complementation capability of the deep autoencoder; (2) noise-robust behavior recognition utilizing the generalization capability of multimodal features; and (3) multimodal causality acquisition and sensory-motor prediction based on the acquired causality.

An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper studies semi-supervised dimensionality reduction using pairwise constraints. In this setting, domain knowledge is given in the form of pairwise constraint, which specifies whether a pair of instances belongs to the same class (must-link constraint) or different classes (cannot-link constraint). In this paper, a novel semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method called LGS3DR is proposed, which can integrate both local and global topological structures of the data as well as pairwise constraints. The LGS3DR method is effective and has a closed form solution. Experiments on data visualization and face recognition show that LGS3DR is superior to many existing dimensionality reduction methods.

Among geometry properties of joints, trace length has a vital importance, because it affects rock mass strength and controls the stability of the rock structures in jointed rock masses. Since joint length has a range of values, it is useful to have an understanding of the distribution of these values in order to predict how the extreme values may be compared to the values obtained from a small sample. For this purpose, three datasets of joint systems from nine exposures of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks are studied. Joint trace length is one of the most difficult properties to measure accurately, but it may be possible to record other geometrical properties of exposed joints accurately; thereby, support vector machine (SVM) model is used to predict the joint trace length. SVM is a novel machine learning method, which is a powerful tool used to solve the problem characterized by small sample and non-linearity with a good generalization performance. Consequently, goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests were applied on these data. According to these GOF tests, the lognormal distribution was found to be the best probability distribution function for representing a joint trace length distribution.

We adopt the geometric framework of optimization on Riemannian quotient manifolds. We study the underlying geometries of several well-known fixed-rank matrix factorizations and then exploit the Riemannian quotient geometry of the search space in the design of a class of gradient descent and trust-region algorithms. The proposed algorithms generalize our previous results on fixed-rank symmetric positive semidefinite matrices, apply to a broad range of applications, scale to high-dimensional problems, and confer a geometric basis to recent contributions on the learning of fixed-rank non-symmetric matrices. We make connections with existing algorithms in the context of low-rank matrix completion and discuss the usefulness of the proposed framework. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithms compete with state-of-the-art algorithms and that manifold optimization offers an effective and versatile framework for the design of machine learning algorithms that learn a fixed-rank matrix.

INDELs affect gene function in multiple ways: for example, by introducing premature stop codons that either lead to the production of truncated proteins or affect transcriptional efficiency. However, the means by which they impact post-transcriptional regulation, including alternative splicing, have not been fully evaluated. In this study, we collate disease-causing INDELs from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and neutral INDELs from the 1000 Genomes Project. The potential of these two types of INDELs to affect binding-site affinity of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) was then evaluated. We identified several sequence features that can distinguish disease-causing INDELs from neutral INDELs. Moreover, we built a machine-learning predictor called PinPor (predicting pathogenic small insertions and deletions affecting post-transcriptional regulation, ) to ascertain which newly observed INDELs are likely to be pathogenic. Our results show that disease-causing INDELs are more likely to ablate RBP-binding sites and tend to affect more RBP-binding sites than neutral INDELs. Additionally, disease-causing INDELs give rise to greater deviations in binding affinity than neutral INDELs. We also demonstrated that disease-causing INDELs may be distinguished from neutral INDELs by several sequence features, such as their proximity to splice sites and their potential effects on RNA secondary structure. This predictor showed satisfactory performance in identifying numerous pathogenic INDELs, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.51 and an accuracy of 0.75.

The goal is sentiment analysis on a corpus containing short textual descriptions of dreams. Dreams are categorized in a four-level scale of positive and negative sentiments. We chose a four scale annotation to reflect the sentiment strength and simplicity at the same time. The approach is based on a novel representation, taking into account the leading themes of the dream and the sequential unfolding of associated sentiments during the dream. The dream representation is based on three combined parts, two of which are automatically produced from the description of the dream. The first part consists of co-occurrence vector representation of dreams in order to detect sentiment levels in the dream texts. Those vectors unlike the standard Bag-of-words model capture non-local relationships between meanings of word in a corpus. The second part introduces the dynamic representation that captures the sentimental changes throughout the progress of the dream. The third part is the self-reported assessment of the dream by the dreamer according to eight given attributes (self-assessment is different in many respects from the dream's sentiment classification). The three representations are subject to aggressive feature selection. Using an ensemble of classifiers on the combined 3-partite representation, the agreement between machine rating and the human judge scores on the four scales was 64 % which is in the range of human experts' consensus in that domain. The accuracy of the system was 14 % more than previous results on the same task.

Therefore, meta-heuristic algorithms are extensively adopted to solve such problems efficiently. This study proposes a regression-based particle swarm optimization for feature selection problem. The proposed algorithm can increase population diversity and avoid local optimal trapping by improving the jump ability of flying particles. The data sets collected from UCI machine learning databases are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Classification accuracy is used as a criterion to evaluate classifier performance. Results show that our proposed approach outperforms both genetic algorithms and sequential search algorithms.

However, when the training samples are not adequate, probability estimation method will inevitably suffer from the zero-frequency problem. To avoid this problem, Laplace-estimate and M-estimate are the two main methods used to estimate probabilities. The estimation of two important parameters m (integer variable) and p (probability variable) in these methods has a direct impact on the underlying experimental results. In this paper, we study the existing probability estimation methods and carry out a parameter Cross-test by experimentally analyzing the performance of M-estimate with different settings for the two parameters m and p. This part of experimental result shows that the optimal parameter values vary corresponding to different data sets. Motivated by these analysis results, we propose an estimation model based on self-adaptive differential evolution. Then we propose an approach to calculate the optimal m and p value for each conditional probability to avoid the zero-frequency problem. We experimentally test our approach in terms of classification accuracy using the 36 benchmark machine learning repository data sets, and compare it to a naive Bayes with Laplace-estimate and M-estimate with a variety of setting of parameters from literature and those possible optimal settings via our experimental analysis. The experimental results show that the estimation model is efficient and our proposed approach significantly outperforms the traditional probability estimation approaches especially for large data sets (large number of instances and attributes).

BoMI promotes the perspective that system users should no longer be operators of the engineering design but should be an embedded part of the functional design. This BoMI system has real-time controllability of robotic devices based on user-specific dynamic body response signatures in high-density 52-channel sensor shirt. The BoMI system not only gives access to the user's body signals, but also translates these signals from user's body to the virtual reality device-control space. We have explored the efficiency of this BoMI system in a semi-cylinderic 3D virtual reality system. Experimental studies are conducted to demonstrate, how this transformation of human body signals of multiple degrees of freedom, controls a robotic wheelchair navigation task in a 3D virtual reality environment. We have also presented how machine learning can enhance the interface to adapt towards the degree of freedoms of human body by correcting the errors performed by the user.

Such correlation of class labels among interrelated instances exists in a wide variety of data, e.g., a web page can belong to multiple categories since its semantics can be recognized in different ways, and the linked web pages are more likely to have the same classes than the unlinked pages. We propose an effective and novel Markov chain based learning method for MLCC problems. Our idea is to model the problem as a Markov chain with restart on transition probability graphs, and to propagate the ranking score of labeled instances to unlabeled instances based on the affinity among instances. The affinity among instances is set up by explicitly using the attribute features derived from the content of instances as well as the correlation features constructed from the links of instances. Intuitively, an instance which contains linked neighbors that are highly similar to the other instances with a high rank of a particular class label, has a high chance of this class label. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two DBLP datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is shown to be better than those of the binary relevance multi-label algorithm, collective classification algorithms (wvRN, ICA and Gibbs), and the ICML algorithm for the tested MLCC problems.

J	Graff, P; Feroz, F; Hobson, MP; Lasenby, A				Graff, Philip; Feroz, Farhan; Hobson, Michael P.; Lasenby, Anthony			SkyNet: an efficient and robust neural network training tool for machine learning in astronomy	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical	COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; DEEP; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; NETS	We present the first public release of our generic neural network training algorithm, called SkyNet. This efficient and robust machine learning tool is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks, including autoencoders, for use in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. SkyNet uses a 'pre-training' method to obtain a set of network parameters that has empirically been shown to be close to a good solution, followed by further optimization using a regularized variant of Newton's method, where the level of regularization is determined and adjusted automatically; the latter uses second-order derivative information to improve convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian matrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector products. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated networks that are difficult to optimize using standard backpropagation techniques. SkyNet employs convergence criteria that naturally prevent overfitting, and also includes a fast algorithm for estimating the accuracy of network outputs. The utility and flexibility of SkyNet are demonstrated by application to a number of toy problems, and to astronomical problems focusing on the recovery of structure from blurred and noisy images, the identification of gamma-ray bursters, and the compression and denoising of galaxy images. The SkyNet software, which is implemented in standard ANSI c and fully parallelized using MPI, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/skynet/.

J	Lu, YW; Fang, XZ; Xie, BL				Lu, Yuwu; Fang, Xiaozhao; Xie, Binglei			Kernel linear regression for face recognition	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Face recognition; Kernel method; Linear regression; Machine learning	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; REPRESENTATION	Linear regression uses the least square algorithm to solve the solution of linear regression equation. Linear regression classification (LRC) shows good classification performance on face image data. However, when the axes of linear regression of class-specific samples have intersections, LRC could not well classify the samples that distribute around intersections. Moreover, the LRC could not perform well at the situation of severe lighting variations. This paper proposes a new classification method, kernel linear regression classification (KLRC), based on LRC and the kernel trick. KLRC is a nonlinear extension of LRC and can offset the drawback of LRC. KLRC implicitly maps the data into a high-dimensional kernel space by using the nonlinear mapping determined by a kernel function. Through this mapping, KLRC is able to make the data more linearly separable and can perform well for face recognition with varying lighting. For comparison, we conduct on three standard databases under some evaluation protocols. The proposed methodology not only outperforms LRC but also takes the better performance than typical kernel methods such as kernel linear discriminant analysis and kernel principal component analysis.

This is invasive and carries hazards associated with any surgical procedures. The present work was undertaken to study the feasibility for such characterization using non-invasive electrical impedance measurements and machine learning techniques. Because of changes in cell morphology of malignant and benign tumours, changes are expected in impedance at a fixed frequency, and versus frequency of measurement. Tetrapolar impedance measurement (TPIM) using four electrodes at the corners of a square region of sides 4 cm was used for zone localization. Data of impedance in two orthogonal directions, measured at 5 and 200 kHz from 19 subjects, and their respective slopes with frequency were subjected to machine learning procedures through the use of feature plots. These patients had single or multiple tumours of various types in one or both breasts, and four of them had malignant tumours, as diagnosed by core biopsy. Although size and depth of the tumours are expected to affect the measurements, this preliminary work ignored these effects. Selecting 12 features from the above measurements, feature plots were drawn for the 19 patients, which displayed considerable overlap between malignant and benign cases. However, based on observed qualitative trend of the measured values, when all the feature values were divided by respective ages, the two types of tumours separated out reasonably well. Using K-NN classification method the results obtained are, positive prediction value: 60%, negative prediction value: 93%, sensitivity: 75%, specificity: 87% and efficacy: 84%, which are very good for such a test on a small sample size. Study on a larger sample is expected to give confidence in this technique, and further improvement of the technique may have the ability to replace biopsy.

J	Huang, Z; Yuan, H				Huang Zhi; Yuan Hong			Research on regional ionospheric TEC modeling using RBF neural network	SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						RBF neural network; ionosphere; TEC modeling		Machine learning techniques which are about the construction and study of system that can learn from data are combined with many application fields. A method on ionospheric total electron content (TEC) mapping is proposed based on radical basis function (RBF) neural network improved by Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Due to the complicated ionospheric behavior over China, GMM is used to determine the center of basis function in the unsupervised training process. Gradient descent is performed to update the weights function on a sum of squared output error function in the supervised learning process. The TEC values from the center for orbit determination in Europe (CODE) global ionospheric maps covering the period from 2007 to 2010 are used to investigate the performance of the developed network model. For independent validation, the simulated TEC values at different latitudes (20A degrees N, 30A degrees N and 40A degrees N) along 120A degrees E longitude are analyzed and evaluated. The results show that the simulated TEC from the RBF network based model has good agreement with the observed CODE TEC with acceptable errors. The theoretical research indicates that RBF can offer a powerful and reliable alternative to the design of ionospheric TEC forecast technologies and thus make a significant contribution to the ionospheric modeling efforts in China.

Mobile malware detection through analysis of deviations in application network behavior	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Mobile applications; Network traffic; Machine learning; Android malware; Anomaly detection; Smartphone security	ANOMALY DETECTION; SYSTEMS	In this paper we present a new behavior-based anomaly detection system for detecting meaningful deviations in a mobile application's network behavior. The main goal of the proposed system is to protect mobile device users and cellular infrastructure companies from malicious applications by: (1) identification of malicious attacks or masquerading applications installed on a mobile device, and (2) identification of republished popular applications injected with a malicious code (i.e., repackaging). More specifically, we attempt to detect a new type of mobile malware with self-updating capabilities that were recently found on the official Google Android marketplace. Malware of this type cannot be detected using the standard signatures approach or by applying regular static or dynamic analysis methods. The detection is performed based on the application's network traffic patterns only. For each application, a model representing its specific traffic pattern is learned locally (i.e., on the device). Semi-supervised machine-learning methods are used for learning the normal behavioral patterns and for detecting deviations from the application's expected behavior. These methods were implemented and evaluated on Android devices. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that: (1) various applications have specific network traffic patterns and certain application categories can be distinguished by their network patterns; (2) different levels of deviation from normal behavior can be detected accurately; (3) in the case of self-updating malware, original (benign) and infected versions of an application have different and distinguishable network traffic patterns that in most cases, can be detected within a few minutes after the malware is executed while presenting very low false alarms rate; and (4) local learning is feasible and has a low performance overhead on mobile devices.

On the adoption of anomaly detection for packed executable filtering	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Malware; Packer; Anomaly detection; Machine-learning; Computer security	MALICIOUS EXECUTABLES; MALWARE; CLASSIFICATION	Malware packing is a common technique employed to hide malicious code and to avoid static analysis. In order to fully inspect the contents of the executable, unpacking techniques must be applied. Unfortunately, generic unpacking is computationally expensive. For this reason, it is important to filter binaries in order to correctly handle them. In previous work, we proposed the adoption of anomaly detection for the classification of packed and not packed binaries using features based on the Portable Executable structure. In this paper, we extend this work and thoroughly evaluate the method with a different dataset and two different feature sets, rendering new conclusions. While anomaly detection is reaffirmed as a sound method for the discrimination of packed and not packed binaries, Portable Executable structure based features present limitations to distinguish custom packed files from not packed files.

The developed approach consists of three primary steps: (i) fusion formulation using a k-fold cross validation model; (ii) diagnostics with multiple multi-attribute classifiers as member algorithms; and (iii) classification fusion through a weighted majority voting with dominance approach. State-of-the-art classification techniques from three broad categories (i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and statistical inference) were employed as member algorithms. The diagnostics results from the fusion approach will be better than, or at least as good as, the best result provided by all individual member algorithms. The developed classification fusion approach is demonstrated with the 2008 PHM challenge problem and rolling bearing health diagnostics problem. Case study results indicated that, in both problems, the developed fusion diagnostics approach outperforms any stand-alone member algorithrn with better diagnostic accuracy and robustness.

In the current paper, a game theoretic method is introduced, namely cooperative Game-based Fuzzy Q-learning (G-FQL). G-FQL adopts a combination of both the game theoretic approach and the fuzzy Q-learning algorithm in WSNs. It is a three-player strategy game consisting of sink nodes, a base station, and an attacker. The game performs at any time a victim node in the network receives a flooding packet as a DDoS attack beyond a specific alarm event threshold in WSN. The proposed model implements cooperative defense counter-attack scenarios for the sink node and the base station to operate as rational decision-maker players through a game theory strategy. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) was simulated using NS-2 simulator. The model is subsequently compared against other existing soft computing methods, such as fuzzy logic controller, Q-learning, and fuzzy Q-learning, in terms of detection accuracy, counter-defense, network lifetime and energy consumption, to demonstrate its efficiency and viability.

Assuring the authenticity of northwest Spain white wine varieties using machine learning techniques	FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Galician white wine varieties; Volatile composition; Assuring authenticity; Machine learning techniques; Feature selection; Model comparison	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPERVISED PATTERN-RECOGNITION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; RED WINES; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; SENSORY EVALUATION; CHEMOMETRIC TECHNIQUES; PHENOLIC COMPOSITION	Classification of wine represents a multi-criteria decision-making problem characterized by great complexity, non-linearity and lack of objective information regarding the quality of the desired final product. Volatile compounds of wines elaborated from four Galician (NW Spain) autochthonous white Vitis vinifera from four consecutive vintages were analysed by gas chromatography (F1D, FPD and MS detectors), and several aroma compounds were used for correctly classifying autochthonous white grape varieties (Albarifio, Treixadura, Loureira and Dona Branca). The objective of the work is twofold: to find a classification model able to precisely differentiate between existing grape varieties (i.e. assuring the authenticity), and to assess the discriminatory power of different family compounds over well-known classifiers (i.e. guaranteeing the typicality). From the experiments carried out, and given the fact that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was not able to accurately separate all the wine varieties, this work investigates the suitability of applying different machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e.: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, MultiLayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes) for classification purposes. Perfect classification accuracy is obtained by the Random Forest algorithm, whilst the other alternatives achieved promising results using only part of the available information.

J	Delvaux, J; Verbauwhede, I				Delvaux, Jeroen; Verbauwhede, Ingrid			Fault Injection Modeling Attacks on 65 nm Arbiter and RO Sum PUFs via Environmental Changes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS			English	Article						Arbiter PUF; fault injection; modeling; repeatability; ring oscillator PUF; supply voltage; temperature		Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are emerging as hardware security primitives. So-called strong PUFs provide a mechanism to authenticate chips which is inherently unique for every manufactured sample. To prevent cloning, modeling of the challenge-response pair (CRP) behavior should be infeasible. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are a well-known threat. Recently, repeatability imperfections of PUF responses have been identified as another threat. CMOS device noise renders a significant fraction of the CRPs unstable, hereby providing a side channel for modeling attacks. In previous work, 65 nm arbiter PUFs have been modeled as such with accuracies exceeding 97%. However, more PUF evaluations were required than for state-of-the-art ML approaches. In this work, we accelerate repeatability attacks by increasing the fraction of unstable CRPs. Response evaluation faults are triggered via environmental changes hereby. The attack speed, which is proportional to the fraction of unstable CRPs, increases with a factor 2.4 for both arbiter and ring oscillator (RO) sum PUFs. Data originates from a 65 nm silicon chip and hence not from simulations.

Intelligent Trip Modeling for the Prediction of an Origin-Destination Traveling Speed Profile	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Neural networks (NNs); speed profile prediction; traffic data; trip modeling	HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES; NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH; OPTIMAL POWER MANAGEMENT; TRAFFIC FLOW; TIME PREDICTION; INFORMATION; WAVES	Accurate prediction of the traffic information in real time such as flow, density, speed, and travel time has important applications in many areas, including intelligent traffic control systems, optimizing vehicle operations, and the routing selection for individual drivers on the road. This is also a challenging problem due to dynamic changes of traffic states by many uncertain factors along a traveling route. In this paper, we present an Intelligent Trip Modeling System (ITMS) that was developed using machine learning to predict the traveling speed profile for a selected route based on the traffic information available at the trip starting time. The ITMS contains neural networks to predict short-term traffic speed based on the traveling day of the week, the traffic congestion levels at the sensor locations along the route, and the traveling time and distances to reach individual sensor locations. The ITMS was trained and evaluated by using ten months of traffic data provided by the California Freeway Performance Measurement System along a California Interstate I-405 route that is 26 mi long and contains 52 traffic sensors. The ITMS was also evaluated by the traffic data acquired from a 32-mi-long freeway section in the state of Michigan. Experimental results show that the proposed system, i.e., ITMS, has the capability of providing accurate predictions of dynamic traffic changes and traveling speed at the beginning of a trip and can generalize well to prediction of speed profiles on the freeway routes other than the routes the system was trained on.

Online unsupervised incremental learning is an important branch of data clustering. However, accurately separating high-density overlapped areas in a network has a direct impact on the performance of the clustering algorithm. In this paper, we propose a load-balancing self-organizing incremental neural network (LB-SOINN) to achieve good clustering results and demonstrate that it is more stable than an enhanced SOINN (E-SOINN). LB-SOINN has all the advantages of E-SOINN, such as robustness to noise and online unsupervised incremental learning. It overcomes the shortcomings of the topology structure generated by E-SOINN, such as dependence on the sequence of the input data, and avoids the turbulence that occurs when separating a composite class into subclasses. Furthermore, we also introduce a distance combination framework to obtain good performance for high-dimensional space-clustering tasks. Experiments involving both artificial and real world data sets indicate that LB-SOINN has superior performance in comparison with E-SOINN and other methods.

High-density and high-throughput peptide arrays are being extensively used to detect tumor biomarkers, examine kinase activity, identify antibodies having low serum titers, and locate antibody signatures. Improving the yield of microarray fabrication involves solving a hard combinatorial optimization problem called the border length minimization problem (BLMP). An important question that remained open for the past 7 years is if the BLMP is tractable or not. We settle this open problem by proving that the BLMP is NP-hard. We also present a hierarchical refinement algorithm that can refine any heuristic solution for the BLMP and prove that the TSP + 1-threading heuristic is an O(N)-approximation.

J	Kindermans, PJ; Tangermann, M; Muller, KR; Schrauwen, B				Kindermans, Pieter-Jan; Tangermann, Michael; Mueller, Klaus-Robert; Schrauwen, Benjamin			Integrating dynamic stopping, transfer learning and language models in an adaptive zero-training ERP speller	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI; unsupervised learning; subject-to-subject transfer; visual event-related potentials; P300; speller matrix	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; BCI; ALGORITHM	Objective. Most BCIs have to undergo a calibration session in which data is recorded to train decoders with machine learning. Only recently zero-training methods have become a subject of study. This work proposes a probabilistic framework for BCI applications which exploit event-related potentials (ERPs). For the example of a visual P300 speller we show how the framework harvests the structure suitable to solve the decoding task by (a) transfer learning, (b) unsupervised adaptation, (c) language model and (d) dynamic stopping. Approach. A simulation study compares the proposed probabilistic zero framework (using transfer learning and task structure) to a state-of-the-art supervised model on n = 22 subjects. The individual influence of the involved components (a)-(d) are investigated. Main results. Without any need for a calibration session, the probabilistic zero-training framework with inter-subject transfer learning shows excellent performance-competitive to a state-of-the-art supervised method using calibration. Its decoding quality is carried mainly by the effect of transfer learning in combination with continuous unsupervised adaptation. Significance. A high-performing zero-training BCI is within reach for one of the most popular BCI paradigms: ERP spelling. Recording calibration data for a supervised BCI would require valuable time which is lost for spelling. The time spent on calibration would allow a novel user to spell 29 symbols with our unsupervised approach. It could be of use for various clinical and non-clinical ERP-applications of BCI.

EEG artifacts of non-neural origin can be separated from neural signals by independent component analysis (ICA). It is unclear (1) how robustly recently proposed artifact classifiers transfer to novel users, novel paradigms or changed electrode setups, and (2) how artifact cleaning by a machine learning classifier impacts the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Approach. Addressing (1), the robustness of different strategies with respect to the transfer between paradigms and electrode setups of a recently proposed classifier is investigated on offline data from 35 users and 3 EEG paradigms, which contain 6303 expert-labeled components from two ICA and preprocessing variants. Addressing (2), the effect of artifact removal on single-trial BCI classification is estimated on BCI trials from 101 users and 3 paradigms. Main results. We show that (1) the proposed artifact classifier generalizes to completely different EEG paradigms. To obtain similar results under massively reduced electrode setups, a proposed novel strategy improves artifact classification. Addressing (2), ICA artifact cleaning has little influence on average BCI performance when analyzed by state-of-the-art BCI methods. When slow motor-related features are exploited, performance varies strongly between individuals, as artifacts may obstruct relevant neural activity or are inadvertently used for BCI control. Significance. Robustness of the proposed strategies can be reproduced by EEG practitioners as the method is made available as an EEGLAB plug-in.

The correctness problem: evaluating the ordering of binary features in rankings	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						The ranking problem; Variables ordering; Feature ranking evaluation; Binary data	SELECTION TECHNIQUES; CLASSIFICATION; CANCER; GENES	In machine learning, feature ranking (FR) algorithms are used to rank features by relevance to the class variable. FR algorithms are mostly investigated for the feature selection problem and less studied for the problem of ranking. This paper focuses on the latter. A question asked about the problem of ranking given in the terminology of FR is: as different FR criteria estimate the relationship between a feature and the class variable differently on a given data, can we determine which criterion better captures the "true" feature-to-class relationship and thus generates the most "correct" order of individual features? This is termed as the "correctness" problem. It requires a reference ordering against which the ranks assigned to features by a FR algorithm are directly compared. The reference ranking is generally unknown for real-life data. In this paper, we show through theoretical and empirical analysis that for two-class classification tasks represented with binary data, the ordering of binary features based on their individual predictive powers can be used as a benchmark. Thus, allowing us to test how correct is the ordering of a FR algorithm. Based on these ideas, an evaluation method termed as FR evaluation strategy (FRES) is proposed. Rankings of three different FR criteria (relief, mutual information, and the diff-criterion) are investigated on five artificially generated and four real-life binary data sets. The results indicate that FRES works equally good for synthetic and real-life data and the diff-criterion generates the most correct orderings for binary data.

Those spatial relationships are used to semiautomatically segment the stations in thoracic CT images. Methods: Fuzzy maps of DRP were automatically extracted by a learning procedure from a database composed of images with stations and anatomical structures manually segmented by consensus between experts. Spatial relationships common to all patients were retained. The segmentation of a new image used an initial rough delineation of anatomical organs and applied the DRP operators. The algorithm was tested with a leave-one-out approach on a database of 5 patients with 10 lymph stations and 30 anatomical structures each. Results were compared to expert delineations with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and bidirectional local distance (BLD). Results: The overall mean DSC was 66% and the mean BLD was 1.7 mm. Best matches were obtained from stations S3P or S4R while lower matches were obtained for stations 1R and 1L. On average, more than 30 spatial relationships were automatically extracted for each station. Conclusions: This feasibility study suggests that mediastinal lymph node stations could be satisfactory segmented from thoracic CT using automatically extracted positional relationships with anatomical organs. This approach requires the anatomical structures to be initially roughly delineated. A similar approach could be applied to other sites where spatial relationships exists between anatomical structures. The complete database of the five reference cases is made publicly available.

For DNA and RNA, low concentrations can be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, but there is no such reaction for proteins. Therefore, the development of single-molecule protein sequencing is a critical step in the search for protein biomarkers. Here, we show that single amino acids can be identified by trapping the molecules between two electrodes that are coated with a layer of recognition molecules, then measuring the electron tunnelling current across the junction. A given molecule can bind in more than one way in the junction, and we therefore use a machine-learning algorithm to distinguish between the sets of electronic 'fingerprints' associated with each binding motif. With this recognition tunnelling technique, we are able to identify D and L enantiomers, a methylated amino acid, isobaric isomers and short peptides. The results suggest that direct electronic sequencing of single proteins could be possible by sequentially measuring the products of processive exopeptidase digestion, or by using a molecular motor to pull proteins through a tunnel junction integrated with a nanopore.

A human digital memory, created with the data from these pervasive devices, produces a more dynamic and data rich memory. Information such as how you felt, where you were and the context of the environment can be established. This paper presents the DigMem system, which utilizes distributed mobile services, linked data and machine learning to create such memories. Along with the design of the system, a prototype has also been developed, and two case studies have been undertaken, which successfully create memories. As well as demonstrating how memories are created, a key concern in human digital memory research relates to the amount of data that is generated and stored. In particular, searching this set of big data is a key challenge. In response to this, the paper evaluates the use of machine learning algorithms, as an alternative to SPARQL, and treats searching as a classification problem. In particular, supervised machine learning algorithms are used to find information in semantic annotations, based on probabilistic reasoning. Our approach produces good results with 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 93% positive predicted value, 100% negative predicted value, and an overall accuracy of 97%.

Herein, cross-species genomic comparison of carcinogen-induced murine and human OSCCs with indolent or metastatic growth yielded results with surprising translational relevance. Experimental Design: Murine OSCC cell lines were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to define their mutational landscape, to define novel candidate cancer genes, and to assess for parallels with known drivers in human OSCC. Expression arrays identified a mouse metastasis signature, and we assessed its representation in four independent human datasets comprising 324 patients using weighted voting and gene set enrichment analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to stratify outcomes. A quantitative real-time PCR assay based on the mouse signature coupled to a machine-learning algorithm was developed and used to stratify an independent set of 31 patients with respect to metastatic lymphadenopathy. Results: NGS revealed conservation of human driver pathway mutations in mouse OSCC, including in Trp53, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, NOTCH, JAK/STAT, and Fat1-4. Moreover, comparative analysis between The Cancer Genome Atlas and mouse samples defined AKAP9, MED12L, and MYH6 as novel putative cancer genes. Expression analysis identified a transcriptional signature predicting aggressiveness and clinical outcomes, which were validated in four independent human OSCC datasets. Finally, we harnessed the translational potential of this signature by creating a clinically feasible assay that stratified patients with OSCC with a 93.5% accuracy. Conclusions: These data demonstrate surprising cross-species genomic conservation that has translational relevance for human oral squamous cell cancer. (C) 2014 AACR.

Data Clustering Using Variants of Rapid Centroid Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Algorithm design and analysis; clustering algorithms; computational complexity; particle swarm optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	Prior work suggests that particle swarm clustering (PSC) can be a powerful tool for solving clustering problems. This paper reviews parts of the PSC algorithm, and shows how and why a new class of algorithms is proposed in an attempt to improve the efficiency and repeatability of PSC. This new implementation is referred to as rapid centroid estimation (RCE). RCE simplifies the update rules of PSC, and greatly reduces computational complexity by enhancing the efficiency of the particle trajectories. On benchmark evaluations with an artificial dataset that has 80 dimensions and a volume of 5000, the RCE variants have iteration times of less than 0.1 s, which compares to iteration times of 2 s for PSC and modified PSC (mPSC). On UC Irvine (UCI) machine learning benchmark datasets, the RCE variants are much faster than PSC and mPSC, and produce clusters with higher purity and greatly improved optimization speeds. For example, the RCE variants are more than 100 times faster than PSC and mPSC on the UCI breast cancer dataset. It can be concluded that the RCE variants are leaner and faster than PSC and mPSC, and that the new optimization strategies also improve clustering quality and repeatability.

We propose the use of the surprisal of the mean, based on Shannon information theory, which best disambiguates a collection of arbitrary and competing models based solely on their predictions. This policy is demonstrated within an iterative coevolutionary framework consisting of symbolic regression for model inference and a genetic algorithm for optimal experiment design. Complex symbolic expressions are reliably inferred using fewer than 32 observations. The policy requires 21% fewer experiments for model inference compared to the baselines and is particularly effective in the presence of noise corruption, local information content as well as high dimensional systems. Furthermore, the policy was applied in a real-world setting to model concrete compression strength, where it was able to achieve 96.1% of the passive machine learning baseline performance with only 16.6% of the data.

Important proteins (or other functional and taxonomic entities) to environmental features can be potentially used as biosensors. A major challenge is how the distribution of protein and gene functions embodies the adaption of microbial communities across environments and host habitats. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization method for linear regression to adapt the challenge. The approach is inspired by local linear embedding (LLE) and we call it a manifold-constrained regularization for linear regression (McRe). The novel regularization procedure also has potential to be used in solving other linear systems. We demonstrate the efficiency and the performance of the approach in both simulation and real data.

B.; Okuno, Yasushi; Marcou, Gilles; Varnek, Alexandre; Horvath, Dragos			Computational chemogenomics: Is it more than inductive transfer?	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN			English	Article						Chemogenomics; Proteochemometrics; QSAR; Machine learning; Inductive transfer	TRICENTRIC PHARMACOPHORE FINGERPRINTS; PROTEIN-COUPLED-RECEPTORS; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE; PHYSICOCHEMICAL FEATURES; INTERACTION PREDICTION; DRUG DISCOVERY; WEB SERVER; DESCRIPTORS; PEPTIDES	High-throughput assays challenge us to extract knowledge from multi-ligand, multi-target activity data. In QSAR, weights are statically fitted to each ligand descriptor with respect to a single endpoint or target. However, computational chemogenomics (CG) has demonstrated benefits of learning from entire grids of data at once, rather than building target-specific QSARs. A possible reason for this is the emergence of inductive knowledge transfer (IT) between targets, providing statistical robustness to the model, with no assumption about the structure of the targets. Relevant protein descriptors in CG should allow one to learn how to dynamically adjust ligand attribute weights with respect to protein structure. Hence, models built through explicit learning (EL) by including protein information, while benefitting from IT enhancement, should provide additional predictive capability, notably for protein deorphanization. This interplay between IT and EL in CG modeling is not sufficiently studied. While IT is likely to occur irrespective of the injected target information, it is not clear whether and when boosting due to EL may occur. EL is only possible if protein description is appropriate to the target set under investigation. The key issue here is the search for evidence of genuine EL exceeding expectations based on pure IT. We explore the problem in the context of Support Vector Regression, using more than 9,400 values of 31 GPCRs, where compound-protein interactions are represented by the concatenation of vectorial descriptions of compounds and proteins. This provides a unified framework to generate both IT-enhanced and potentially EL-enabled models, where the difference is toggled by supplied protein information. For EL-enabled models, protein information includes genuine protein descriptors such as typical sequence-based terms, but also the experimentally determined affinity cross-correlation fingerprints. These latter benchmark the expected behavior of a quasi-ideal descriptor capturing the actual functional protein-protein relatedness, and therefore thought to be the most likely to enable EL. EL- and IT-based methods were benchmarked alongside classical QSAR, with respect to cross-validation and deorphanization challenges. A rational method for projecting benchmarked methodologies into a strategy space is given, in the aims that the projection will provide directions for the types of molecule designs possible using a given methodology. While EL-enabled strategies outperform classical QSARs and favorably compare to similar published results, they are, in all respects evaluated herein, not strongly distinguished from IT-enhanced models. Moreover, EL-enabled strategies failed to prove superior in deorphanization challenges. Therefore, this paper raises caution that, contrary to common belief and intuitive expectation, the benefits of chemogenomics models over classical QSAR are quite possibly due less to the injection of protein-related information, and rather impacted more by the effect of inductive transfer, due to simultaneous learning from all of the modeled endpoints. These results show that the field of protein descriptor research needs further improvements to truly realize the expected benefit of EL.	[Brown, J.

Many clustering methods have been used for chemical databases, but there is no clustering method that can obtain the best results under all circumstances. However, little attention has been focused on the use of combination methods for chemical structure clustering, which is known as consensus clustering. Recently, consensus clustering has been used in many areas including bioinformatics, machine learning and information theory. This process can improve the robustness, stability, consistency and novelty of clustering. For chemical databases, different consensus clustering methods have been used including the co-association matrix-based, graph-based, hypergraph-based and voting-based methods. In this paper, a weighted cumulative voting-based aggregation algorithm (W-CVAA) was developed. The MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) benchmark chemical dataset was used in the experiments and represented by the AlogP and ECPF_4 descriptors. The results from the clustering methods were evaluated by the ability of the clustering to separate biologically active molecules in each cluster from inactive ones using different criteria, and the effectiveness of the consensus clustering was compared to that of Ward's method, which is the current standard clustering method in chemoinformatics. This study indicated that weighted voting-based consensus clustering can overcome the limitations of the existing voting-based methods and improve the effectiveness of combining multiple clusterings of chemical structures.

On the basis of ensemble machine learning models fit to naturalistic written productions of German advanced learners of English and expert writers, we set out to reverse engineer differences in the weighting of multiple cues in a clause linearization problem. We found that, while German advanced learners succeeded in identifying important cues, their assignment of cue importance differed from that of the expert control group. Even at advanced levels, learners are found to rely on a smaller set of perceptually salient cues than native speakers do, focusing on cues that exhibit relatively high cue availability and relatively low cue reliability. Our findings suggest that the principles of the Unified Model of first and second language acquisition, which have been extensively supported for comprehension also underlie the written production of advanced second language learners.

Our study draws on the increasing availability of gene expression and protein concentration time series for key circadian clock components in Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, gene expression and protein concentration time series are simulated from a recently published regulatory network of the circadian clock in A. thaliana, in which protein and gene interactions are described by a Markov jump process based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We closely follow recent experimental protocols, including the entrainment of seedlings to different light-dark cycles and the knock-out of various key regulatory genes. Our study provides relative network reconstruction accuracy scores for a critical comparative performance evaluation, and sheds light on a series of highly relevant questions: it quantifies the influence of systematically missing values related to unknown protein concentrations and mRNA transcription rates, it investigates the dependence of the performance on the network topology and the degree of recurrency, it provides deeper insight into when and why non-linear methods fail to outperform linear ones, it offers improved guidelines on parameter settings in different inference procedures, and it suggests new hypotheses about the structure of the central circadian gene regulatory network in A. thaliana.

The application of diagnostic tools in combination with measurement evaluation that can be performed in a reliable and automated fashion plays a key role in this context. As the progression of various cancer diseases and the effectiveness of their treatments are related to a varying number of tumor cells that circulate in blood, the determination of their extremely low numbers by liquid biopsy is a decisive prognostic marker. To detect and enumerate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in a reliable and automated fashion, we apply methods from machine learning using a naive Bayesian classifier (NBC) based on a probabilistic generative mixture model. Cells are collected with a functionalized medical wire and are stained for fluorescence microscopy so that their color signature can be used for classification through the construction of Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color histograms. Exploiting the information on the fluorescence signature of CTCs by the NBC does not only allow going beyond previous approaches but also provides a method of unsupervised learning that is required for unlabeled training data. A quantitative comparison with a state-of-the-art support vector machine, which requires labeled data, demonstrates the competitiveness of the NBC method.

Ventricular Fibrillation and Tachycardia Classification Using a Machine Learning Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Machine learning; public domain electrocardiogram (ECG) database; support vector machine (SVM); ventricular fibrillation (VF) detection	THREATENING CARDIAC-ARRHYTHMIAS; SURFACE ECG; FREQUENCY; RECOGNITION; PARAMETERS; ALGORITHM; SET	Correct detection and classification of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and rapid ventricular tachycardia (VT) is of pivotal importance for an automatic external defibrillator and patient monitoring. In this paper, a VF/VT classification algorithm using a machine learning method, a support vector machine, is proposed. A total of 14 metrics were extracted from a specific window length of the electrocardiogram (ECG). A genetic algorithm was then used to select the optimal variable combinations. Three annotated public domain ECG databases (the American Heart Association Database, the Creighton University Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Database, and the MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia Database) were used as training, test, and validation datasets. Different window sizes, varying from 1 to 10 s were tested. An accuracy (Ac) of 98.1%, sensitivity (Se) of 98.4%, and specificity (Sp) of 98.0% were obtained on the in-sample training data with 5 s-window size and two selected metrics. On the out-of-sample validation data, an Ac of 96.3% +/- 3.4%, Se of 96.2% +/- 2.7%, and Sp of 96.2% +/- 4.6% were obtained by fivefold cross validation. The results surpass those of current reported methods.

Learning to Detect Vocal Hyperfunction From Ambulatory Neck-Surface Acceleration Features: Initial Results for Vocal Fold Nodules	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Ambulatory voice monitoring; clinical detection; machine learning; vocal cord; vocal fold nodules	VOICE DISORDERS; V-RQOL; TEACHERS	Voice disorders are medical conditions that often result from vocal abuse/misuse which is referred to generically as vocal hyperfunction. Standard voice assessment approaches cannot accurately determine the actual nature, prevalence, and pathological impact of hyperfunctional vocal behaviors because such behaviors can vary greatly across the course of an individual's typical day and may not be clearly demonstrated during a brief clinical encounter. Thus, it would be clinically valuable to develop noninvasive ambulatory measures that can reliably differentiate vocal hyperfunction from normal patterns of vocal behavior. As an initial step toward this goal we used an accelerometer taped to the neck surface to provide a continuous, noninvasive acceleration signal designed to capture some aspects of vocal behavior related to vocal cord nodules, a common manifestation of vocal hyperfunction. We gathered data from 12 female adult patients diagnosed with vocal fold nodules and 12 control speakers matched for age and occupation. We derived features from weeklong neck-surface acceleration recordings by using distributions of sound pressure level and fundamental frequency over 5-min windows of the acceleration signal and normalized these features so that intersubject comparisons were meaningful. We then used supervised machine learning to show that the two groups exhibit distinct vocal behaviors that can be detected using the acceleration signal. We were able to correctly classify 22 of the 24 subjects, suggesting that in the future measures of the acceleration signal could be used to detect patients with the types of aberrant vocal behaviors that are associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders.

Current breathomics-a review on data pre-processing techniques and machine learning in metabolomics breath analysis	JOURNAL OF BREATH RESEARCH			English	Article						GC-MS; MCC-IMS; exhaled air; multivariate analysis; volatile organic compounds (VOCs)	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; COLORIMETRIC SENSOR ARRAY; ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY; FLIGHT MASS-SPECTROMETER; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HUMAN EXHALED AIR; ELECTRONIC-NOSE; LUNG-CANCER; BIOLOGICAL DATA; CHROMATOGRAPHIC PROFILES	We define breathomics as the metabolomics study of exhaled air. It is a strongly emerging metabolomics research field that mainly focuses on health-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since the amount of these compounds varies with health status, breathomics holds great promise to deliver non-invasive diagnostic tools. Thus, the main aim of breathomics is to find patterns of VOCs related to abnormal (for instance inflammatory) metabolic processes occurring in the human body. Recently, analytical methods for measuring VOCs in exhaled air with high resolution and high throughput have been extensively developed. Yet, the application of machine learning methods for fingerprinting VOC profiles in the breathomics is still in its infancy. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the current state of the art in data pre-processing and multivariate analysis of breathomics data. We start with the detailed pre-processing pipelines for breathomics data obtained from gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and an ion-mobility spectrometer coupled to multi-capillary columns. The outcome of data pre-processing is a matrix containing the relative abundances of a set of VOCs for a group of patients under different conditions (e.g. disease stage, treatment). Independently of the utilized analytical method, the most important question, 'which VOCs are discriminatory?', remains the same. Answers can be given by several modern machine learning techniques (multivariate statistics) and, therefore, are the focus of this paper. We demonstrate the advantages as well the drawbacks of such techniques. We aim to help the community to understand how to profit from a particular method. In parallel, we hope to make the community aware of the existing data fusion methods, as yet unresearched in breathomics.	[Smolinska, A.; Fijten, R. R. R.; Dallinga, J. W.; van Schooten, F.

Machine learning (ML) is an essential approach for achieving practical and effective solutions for this problem. Many comparisons of ML methods for yield prediction have been made, seeking for the most accurate technique. Generally, the number of evaluated crops and techniques is too low and does not provide enough_ information for agricultural planning purposes. This paper compares the predictive accuracy of ML and linear regression techniques for crop yield prediction in ten crop datasets. Multiple linear regression, MS-Prime regression trees, perceptron multilayer neural networks, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbor methods were ranked. Four accuracy metrics were used to validate the models: the root mean square error (RMS), root relative square error (RRSE), normalized mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation factor (R). Real data of an irrigation zone of Mexico were used for building the models. Models were tested with samples of two consecutive years. The results show that M5Prime and k-nearest neighbor techniques obtain the lowest average RMSE errors (5.14 and 4.91), the lowest RRSE errors (79.46% and 79.78%), the lowest average MAE errors (18.12% and 19.42%), and the highest average correlation factors (0.41 and 0.42). Since M5-Prime achieves the largest number of crop yield models with the lowest errors, it is a very suitable tool for massive crop yield prediction in agricultural planning.

The manual inspection of this fruit used today cannot detect the damage in very early stages of maturity and to date no automatic tool capable of such detection has been developed, since current systems based on machine vision only detect very visible damage. The application of hyperspectral imaging to the postharvest quality inspection of fruit is relatively recent and research is still underway to find a method of estimating internal properties or detecting invisible damage. This work describes a new system to evaluate mechanically induced damage in the pericarp of 'Manila' mangos at different stages of ripeness based on the analysis of hyperspectral images. Images of damaged and intact areas of mangos were acquired in the range 650-1100 nm using a hyperspectral computer vision system and then analysed to select the most discriminating wavelengths for distinguishing and classifying the two zones. Eleven feature-selection methods were used and compared to determine the wavelengths, while another five classification methods were used to segment the resulting multispectral images and classify the skin of the mangos as sound or damaged. A 97.9% rate of correct classification of pixels was achieved on the third day after the damage had been caused using k-Nearest Neighbours and the whole spectra and the figure dropped to 91.4% when only the most discriminant bands were used.

Machine learning assessments of soil drying for agricultural planning	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Soil drying; Field readiness; Machine learning; Nearest neighbors; Soil moisture; Decision support	MOISTURE CONTENT; WATER; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; IMAGERY	The hydrologic processes of wetting and drying play a crucial role in agricultural activities involving heavy equipment on unpaved terrain. When soil conditions moisten, equipment can become mired, causing expensive delays. While experienced users may assess soil conditions before entering off-road areas, novice users or those who must remotely assess sites before traveling may have difficulty assessing conditions reliably. One means of assessing dryness is remotely-monitored in situ sensors. Unfortunately, land owners hesitate to place sensors due to monetary costs, complexity, and sometimes infeasibility of physical visits to remote locations. This work addresses these limitations by modeling the wetting/drying process through machine learning algorithms fed by hydrologic data - remotely assessing soil conditions using only publicly-accessible information. Classification trees, k-nearest-neighbors, and boosted perceptrons deliver statistical soil dryness estimates at a site located in Urbana, IL The k-nearest-neighbor and boosted perceptron algorithms both performed with 91-94% accuracy, with most misclassifications falling within calculated margins of error. These analyses demonstrate that reasonably accurate predictions of current soil conditions are possible with only precipitation and potential evaporation data. These two values are measured throughout the continental United States and are likely to be available globally from satellite sensors in the near future. Through this type of approach, agricultural management decisions can be enabled remotely, without the time and expense of on-site visitations or extensive ground-based sensory grids.

Careful analysis of connected speech can provide valuable information about a patient's language capacities. To date, this type of analysis has been limited by its time-consuming nature. In this study, we present a method for evaluating and classifying connected speech in primary progressive aphasia using computational techniques. Syntactic and semantic features were automatically extracted from transcriptions of narrative speech for three groups: semantic dementia (SD), progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), and healthy controls. Features that varied significantly between the groups were used to train machine learning classifiers, which were then tested on held-out data. We achieved accuracies well above baseline on the three binary classification tasks. An analysis of the influential features showed that in contrast with controls, both patient groups tended to use words which were higher in frequency (especially nouns for SD, and verbs for PNFA). The SD patients also tended to use words (especially nouns) that were higher in familiarity, and they produced fewer nouns, but more demonstratives and adverbs, than controls. The speech of the PNFA group tended to be slower and incorporate shorter words than controls. The patient groups were distinguished from each other by the SD patients' relatively increased use of words which are high in frequency and/or familiarity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Machine learning (ML) algorithms can 'learn' from data: for instance a ML system can be trained on a set of features derived from written texts belonging to known categories, and learn to distinguish between them. Such a trained system can then be used to classify unseen texts. In this paper, we explore the potential of the technique to classify transcribed speech samples along clinical dimensions, using vocabulary data alone. We report the accuracy with which two related ML algorithms [naive Bayes Gaussian (NBG) and naive Bayes multinomial (NBM)] categorized picture descriptions produced by: 32 semantic dementia (SD) patients versus 10 healthy, age-matched controls; and SD patients with left- (n = 21) versus right-predominant (n = 11) patterns of temporal lobe atrophy. We used information gain (IG) to identify the vocabulary features that were most informative to each of these two distinctions. In the SD versus control classification task, both algorithms achieved accuracies of greater than 90%. In the right- versus left-temporal lobe predominant classification, NBM achieved a high level of accuracy (88%), but this was achieved by both NBM and NBG when the features used in the training set were restricted to those with high values of IG. The most informative features for the patient versus control task were low frequency content words, generic terms and components of metanarrative statements. For the right versus left task the number of informative lexical features was too small to support any specific inferences. An enriched feature set, including values derived from Quantitative Production Analysis (QPA) may shed further light on this little understood distinction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Latent information in fluency lists predicts functional decline in persons at risk for Alzheimer disease	CORTEX			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Cognitive neuropsychology; Dementia; MCI (mild cognitive impairment); Machine learning; Random forests	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; VERBAL FLUENCY; FINANCIAL ABILITIES; CONVERSION; DEMENTIA; DIAGNOSIS; CAPACITY; INFERIOR; ATROPHY	Objective: We constructed random forest classifiers employing either the traditional method of scoring semantic fluency word lists or new methods. These classifiers were then compared in terms of their ability to diagnose Alzheimer disease (AD) or to prognosticate among individuals along the continuum from cognitively normal (CN) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Method: Semantic fluency lists from 44 cognitively normal elderly individuals, 80 MCI patients, and 41 AD patients were transcribed into electronic text files and scored by four methods: traditional raw scores, clustering and switching scores, "generalized" versions of clustering and switching, and a method based on independent components analysis (ICA). Random forest classifiers based on raw scores were compared to "augmented" classifiers that incorporated newer scoring methods. Outcome variables included AD diagnosis at baseline, MCI conversion, increase in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score, or decrease in Financial Capacity Instrument (FCI) score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each classifier and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. We compared AUC between raw and augmented classifiers using Delong's test and assessed validity and reliability of the augmented classifier. Results: Augmented classifiers outperformed classifiers based on raw scores for the outcome measures AD diagnosis (AUC .97 vs .95), MCI conversion (AUC .91 vs .77), CDR-SOB increase (AUC .90 vs .79), and FCI decrease (AUC .89 vs .72). Measures of validity and stability over time support the use of the method. Conclusion: Latent information in semantic fluency word lists is useful for predicting cognitive and functional decline among elderly individuals at increased risk for developing AD. Modem machine learning methods may incorporate latent information to enhance the diagnostic value of semantic fluency raw scores. These methods could yield information valuable for patient care and clinical trial design with a relatively small investment of time and money. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Clark, D. G.; Blanton, P.

Do such events that extend in time elicit evoked responses of similar strength as evoked responses associated with instantaneous events such as the presentation of a static target image? Using a set of simulated scenarios, with avatars/actors having different behaviors, we identified evoked neural activity discriminative of target vs. distractor events (behaviors) at discrimination levels that are comparable to static imagery. EEG discriminative activity was largely in the time-locked evoked response and not in oscillatory activity, with the exception of very low EEG frequency bands such as delta and theta, which simply represent bands dominating the event related potential (ERP). The discriminative evoked response activity we see is observed in all target/distractor conditions and is robust across different recordings from the same subjects. The results suggest that we have identified a robust neural correlate of target detection in video, at least in terms of the stimulus set we used-i.e., dynamic behavior of an individual in a low clutter environment. Additional work is needed to test a larger variety of behaviors and more diverse environments.

The question of how the visual system is able to develop stable or invariant states through the ever transforming environment is central to understanding the brain's recognition process. The coined term slowness principle used in slow feature analysis is a reference to the brain's ability to generate slow changing and thus stable percepts in response to the fast varying visual stimulations in the environment. Based on this principle this paper deals with categorization of video sequences composed of dynamic natural scenes. Unlike models relying on supervised learning or handcrafted descriptors, we represent videos using unsupervised learning of motion features. Our method is based on: 1) Slow feature analysis principle from which motion features representing the principal and more stable motion components of training videos are learned. 2) Integration of the local motion feature into a global classification architecture. Classification experiments produce 11% and 19% improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods on two dynamic natural scenes data sets. A quantitative and qualitative analysis illustrates how the learned slow features untangle the input manifolds and remain stable under various parameters settings.

A Supervised Learning Framework for Modeling Director Agent Strategies in Educational Interactive Narrative	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND AI IN GAMES			English	Article						Bayesian networks; interactive drama; machine learning; narrative; serious games		Computational models of interactive narrative offer significant potential for creating educational game experiences that are procedurally tailored to individual players and support learning. A key challenge posed by interactive narrative is devising effective director agent models that dynamically sequence story events according to players' actions and needs. In this paper, we describe a supervised machine-learning framework to model director agent strategies in an educational interactive narrative Crystal Island. Findings from two studies with human participants are reported. The first study utilized a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm where human "wizards" directed participants through Crystal Island's mystery storyline by dynamically controlling narrative events in the game environment. Interaction logs yielded training data for machine learning the conditional probabilities of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model of the human wizards' directorial actions. Results indicate that the DBN model achieved significantly higher precision and recall than naive Bayes and bigram model techniques. In the second study, the DBN director agent model was incorporated into the runtime version of Crystal Island, and its impact on students' narrative-centered learning experiences was investigated. Results indicate that machine-learning director agent strategies from human demonstrations yield models that positively shape players' narrative-centered learning and problem-solving experiences.

This approach relies on the expression of the intrinsic structure of the multivariate sequences in the form of structural constraints, which are imposed on dimensionality reduction process to generate a compact and data-driven manifold in a low dimensional space. This manifold is a mathematical representation of the intrinsic nature of the concept of interest regardless of the stylistic variability found in its instances. In addition, this approach is extended to model jointly several related concepts within a unified representation creating a continuous space between concept manifolds. Since a generated manifold encodes the unique characteristic of the concept of interest, it can be employed for classification of unknown instances of concepts. Exhaustive experimental evaluation on different datasets confirms the superiority of the proposed methodology to other state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods. Finally, the practical value of this novel dimensionality reduction method is demonstrated in three challenging computer vision applications, i.e., view-dependent and view-independent action recognition as well as human-human interaction classification.

In some situations, attentional tunneling is likely to appear and leads to excessive focus and poor decision making. In this study, we propose a formal approach to detect the occurrence of such an attentional impairment that is based on machine learning techniques. An experiment was conducted to provoke attentional tunneling during which psycho-physiological and oculomotor data from 23 participants were collected. Data from 18 participants were used to train an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). From a machine learning point of view, the classification performance of the trained ANFIS proved the validity of this approach. Furthermore, the resulting classification rules were consistent with the attentional tunneling literature. Finally, the classifier was robust to detect attentional tunneling when performing over test data from four participants.

The ability to predict defect-prone software components would be valuable. Consequently, there have been many empirical studies to evaluate the performance of different techniques endeavouring to accomplish this effectively. However no one technique dominates and so designing a reliable defect prediction model remains problematic. Objective. We seek to make sense of the many conflicting experimental results and understand which factors have the largest effect on predictive performance. Method. We conduct a meta-analysis of all relevant, high quality primary studies of defect prediction to determine what factors influence predictive performance. This is based on 42 primary studies that satisfy our inclusion criteria that collectively report 600 sets of empirical prediction results. By reverse engineering a common response variable we build a random effects ANOVA model to examine the relative contribution of four model building factors (classifier, data set, input metrics and researcher group) to model prediction performance. Results. Surprisingly we find that the choice of classifier has little impact upon performance (1.3 percent) and in contrast the major (31 percent) explanatory factor is the researcher group. It matters more who does the work than what is done. Conclusion. To overcome this high level of researcher bias, defect prediction researchers should (i) conduct blind analysis, (ii) improve reporting protocols and (iii) conduct more intergroup studies in order to alleviate expertise issues. Lastly, research is required to determine whether this bias is prevalent in other applications domains.

Its innovative peculiarities include incrementality (allowing quick learning even in the presence of noise and changed behavior), strict adherence to the observed practices, ability to learn complex conditions for the workflow components, and improved expressive power compared to the state of the art. This paper presents the entire algorithmic apparatus of WoMan, including translation and learning from a standard log format for case representation, import/export of workflow models from/into standard formalisms (Petri nets), and exploitation of the learned models for process simulation and monitoring. Qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluation shows the power and efficiency of WoMan, both in controlled and in real-world domains.

J	Shatnawi, R				Shatnawi, Raed			Empirical study of fault prediction for open-source systems using the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics	IET SOFTWARE			English	Article							OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN; SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; PRONENESS; TUTORIAL; COHESION; QUALITY	Software testers are usually provoked with projects that have faults. Predicting a class's fault-proneness is vital for minimising cost and improving the effectiveness of the software testing. Previous research on software metrics has shown strong relationships between software metrics and faults in object-oriented systems using a binary variable. However, these models do not consider the history of faults in classes. In this work, a dependent variable is proposed that uses fault history to rate classes into four categories (none, low risk, medium risk and high risk) and to improve the predictive capability of fault models. The study is conducted on many releases of four open-source systems. The study tests the statistical differences in seven machine learning algorithms to find whether the proposed variable can be used to build better prediction models. The performance of the classifiers using the four categories is significantly better than the binary variable. In addition, the results show improvements on the reliability of the prediction models as the software matures. Therefore the fault history improves the prediction of fault-proneness of classes in open-source systems.

J	Liu, MX; Zhang, DQ				Liu, Mingxia; Zhang, Daoqiang			SPARSITY SCORE: A NOVEL GRAPH-PRESERVING FEATURE SELECTION METHOD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Feature selection; sparse representation; l(1) graph; clustering; classification	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FACE RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK	As thousands of features are available in many pattern recognition and machine learning applications, feature selection remains an important task to find the most compact representation of the original data. In the literature, although a number of feature selection methods have been developed, most of them focus on optimizing specific objective functions. In this paper, we first propose a general graph-preserving feature selection framework where graphs to be preserved vary in specific definitions, and show that a number of existing filter-type feature selection algorithms can be unified within this framework. Then, based on the proposed framework, a new filter-type feature selection method called sparsity score (SS) is proposed. This method aims to preserve the structure of a pre-defined l(1) graph that is proven robust to data noise. Here, the modified sparse representation based on an l(1)-norm minimization problem is used to determine the graph adjacency structure and corresponding affinity weight matrix simultaneously. Furthermore, a variant of SS called supervised SS (SuSS) is also proposed, where the l(1) graph to be preserved is constructed by using only data points from the same class. Experimental results of clustering and classification tasks on a series of benchmark data sets show that the proposed methods can achieve better performance than conventional filter-type feature selection methods.

The evolutionary-inspired approach has been used to develop the learning-based decision model in the following manner: the hybridization of algorithms has been considered as "crossover", while the development of new variants which can be thought of as "mutation". An appropriate hierarchy of the component algorithms was established based on a statistically built fitness measure. A synergetic decision-making process, based on a weighted voting system, involved the collaboration between the selected algorithms in making the final decision. Well-established statistical performance measures and comparison tests have been extensively used to design and implement the model. Finally, the proposed method has been tested on five medical datasets, out of which four publicly available, and contrasted with state-of-the-art techniques, showing its efficiency in supporting the medical decision-making process.

J	Skeppstedt, M; Kvist, M; Nilsson, GH; Dalianis, H				Skeppstedt, Maria; Kvist, Maria; Nilsson, Gunnar H.; Dalianis, Hercules			Automatic recognition of disorders, findings, pharmaceuticals and body structures from clinical text: An annotation and machine learning study	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Named entity recognition; Corpora development; Clinical text processing; Disorder; Finding; Swedish	MEDICATION INFORMATION; DISCHARGE SUMMARIES; EXTRACTION; CHALLENGE; AGREEMENT	Automatic recognition of clinical entities in the narrative text of health records is useful for constructing applications for documentation of patient care, as well as for secondary usage in the form of medical knowledge extraction. There are a number of named entity recognition studies on English clinical text, but less work has been carried out on clinical text in other languages. This study was performed on Swedish health records, and focused on four entities that are highly relevant for constructing a patient overview and for medical hypothesis generation, namely the entities: Disorder, Finding, Pharmaceutical Drug and Body Structure. The study had two aims: to explore how well named entity recognition methods previously applied to English clinical text perform on similar texts written in Swedish; and to evaluate whether it is meaningful to divide the more general category Medical Problem, which has been used in a number of previous studies, into the two more granular entities, Disorder and Finding. Clinical notes from a Swedish internal medicine emergency unit were annotated for the four selected entity categories, and the inter-annotator agreement between two pairs of annotators was measured, resulting in an average F-score of 0.79 for Disorder, 0.66 for Finding, 0.90 for Pharmaceutical Drug and 0.80 for Body Structure. A subset of the developed corpus was thereafter used for finding suitable features for training a conditional random fields model. Finally, a new model was trained on this subset, using the best features and settings, and its ability to generalise to held-out data was evaluated. This final model obtained an F-score of 0.81 for Disorder, 0.69 for Finding, 0.88 for Pharmaceutical Drug, 0.85 for Body Structure and 0.78 for the combined category Disorder + Finding. The obtained results, which are in line with or slightly lower than those for similar studies on English clinical text, many of them conducted using a larger training data set, show that the approaches used for English are also suitable for Swedish clinical text. However, a small proportion of the errors made by the model are less likely to occur in English text, showing that results might be improved by further tailoring the system to clinical Swedish. The entity recognition results for the individual entities Disorder and Finding show that it is meaningful to separate the general category Medical Problem into these two more granular entity types, e.g. for knowledge mining of co-morbidity relations and disorder-finding relations.

J	Hassanzadeh, H; Groza, T; Hunter, J				Hassanzadeh, Hamed; Groza, Tudor; Hunter, Jane			Identifying scientific artefacts in biomedical literature: The Evidence Based Medicine use case	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Evidence Based Medicine; Text classification; PICO; PIBOSO; Machine Learning	ARTICLES; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; ANNOTATION; LANGUAGE; CORPUS; TEXT	Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) provides a framework that makes use of the current best evidence in the domain to support clinicians in the decision making process. In most cases, the underlying foundational knowledge is captured in scientific publications that detail specific clinical studies or randomised controlled trials. Over the course of the last two decades, research has been performed on modelling key aspects described within publications (e.g., aims, methods, results), to enable the successful realisation of the goals of EBM. A significant outcome of this research has been the PICO (Population/Problem-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome) structure, and its refined version PIBOSO (Population-Intervention-Background-Outcome-Study Design-Other), both of which provide a formalisation of these scientific artefacts. Subsequently, using these schemes, diverse automatic extraction techniques have been proposed to streamline the knowledge discovery and exploration process in EBM. In this paper, we present a Machine Learning approach that aims to classify sentences according to the PIBOSO scheme. We use a discriminative set of features that do not rely on any external resources to achieve results comparable to the state of the art. A corpus of 1000 structured and unstructured abstracts - i.e., the NICTA-PIBOSO corpus - is used for training and testing. Our best CRF classifier achieves a micro-average F-score of 90.74% and 87.21%, respectively, over structured and unstructured abstracts, which represents an increase of 25.48 percentage points and 26.6 percentage points in F-score when compared to the best existing approaches.

J	Tuarob, S; Tucker, CS; Salathe, M; Ram, N				Tuarob, Suppawong; Tucker, Conrad S.; Salathe, Marcel; Ram, Nilam			An ensemble heterogeneous classification methodology for discovering health-related knowledge in social media messages	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Social media; Machine learning; Classification	TEXT; WEB; SURVEILLANCE; MEDICINE; PLATFORM; FACEBOOK	Objectives: The role of social media as a source of timely and massive information has become more apparent since the era of Web 2.0. Multiple studies illustrated the use of information in social media to discover biomedical and health-related knowledge. Most methods proposed in the literature employ traditional document classification techniques that represent a document as a bag of words. These techniques work well when documents are rich in text and conform to standard English; however, they are not optimal for social media data where sparsity and noise are norms. This paper aims to address the limitations posed by the traditional bag-of-word based methods and propose to use heterogeneous features in combination with ensemble machine learning techniques to discover health-related information, which could prove to be useful to multiple biomedical applications, especially those needing to discover health-related knowledge in large scale social media data. Furthermore, the proposed methodology could be generalized to discover different types of information in various kinds of textual data. Methodology: Social media data is characterized by an abundance of short social-oriented messages that do not conform to standard languages, both grammatically and syntactically. The problem of discovering health-related knowledge in social media data streams is then transformed into a text classification problem, where a text is identified as positive if it is health-related and negative otherwise. We first identify the limitations of the traditional methods which train machines with N-gram word features, then propose to overcome such limitations by utilizing the collaboration of machine learning based classifiers, each of which is trained to learn a semantically different aspect of the data. The parameter analysis for tuning each classifier is also reported. Data sets: Three data sets are used in this research. The first data set comprises of approximately 5000 hand-labeled tweets, and is used for cross validation of the classification models in the small scale experiment, and for training the classifiers in the real-world large scale experiment. The second data set is a random sample of real-world Twitter data in the US. The third data set is a random sample of real-world Facebook Timeline posts. Evaluations: Two sets of evaluations are conducted to investigate the proposed model's ability to discover health-related information in the social media domain: small scale and large scale evaluations. The small scale evaluation employs 10-fold cross validation on the labeled data, and aims to tune parameters of the proposed models, and to compare with the stage-of-the-art method. The large scale evaluation tests the trained classification models on the native, real-world data sets, and is needed to verify the ability of the proposed model to handle the massive heterogeneity in real-world social media. Findings: The small scale experiment reveals that the proposed method is able to mitigate the limitations in the well established techniques existing in the literature, resulting in performance improvement of 18.61% (F-measure). The large scale experiment further reveals that the baseline fails to perform well on larger data with higher degrees of heterogeneity, while the proposed method is able to yield reasonably good performance and outperform the baseline by 46.62% (F-Measure) on average.

General machine learning method (GMLM) classifiers perform fairly well at prediction if the training dataset is well prepared. However, a common problem in preparing the training dataset is the lack of a negative dataset. To address this problem, we proposed two methods that can help GMLM better select the negative training dataset from the test dataset. The prediction accuracy was improved with the training dataset from the proposed strategies. The classifier identified 1797 and 227 potential DT proteins, some of which were mentioned in previous research, which added correlative weight to the new method. Practically, these two sets of potential DT proteins or their homologues are worth considering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

During this time, about 500 works addressing MGR have been published, and at least 10 campaigns have been run to evaluate MGR systems. This makes MGR one of the most researched areas of MIR. So, where does MGR now lie? We show that in spite of this massive amount of work, MGR does not lie far from where it began, and the paramount reason for this is that most evaluation in MGR lacks validity. We perform a case study of all published research using the most-used benchmark dataset in MGR during the past decade: GTZAN. We show that none of the evaluations in these many works is valid to produce conclusions with respect to recognizing genre, i.e. that a system is using criteria relevant for recognizing genre. In fact, the problems of validity in evaluation also affect research in music emotion recognition and autotagging. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for MGR and MIR in the next ten years.

In particular, we train a classifier on the manual annotations of the corpus in order to investigate to which extent the encoding of emotions contribute to the prediction of the feedback functions of facial expressions. This work builds upon and extends previous research on (a) the annotation and analysis of emotions in the corpus in which it was suggested that emotions are related to specific communicative functions, and (b) the prediction of feedback head movements using multimodal information. The results of the experiments show that information on multimodal behaviours which co-occur with the facial expressions improve the classifier performance. The improvement of the F-measure with respect to the unimodal baseline is of 0.269 and this result is parallel to that obtained for head movements in the same corpus. The experiments also show that the annotations of emotions contribute further to the prediction of feedback facial expressions confirming their relation. The best results are obtained training the classifier on the shape of facial expressions and co-occurring head movements, emotion labels, the gesturer's and the interlocutor's speech and can be used in applied systems.

The design, implementation, testing and validation of a custom mobility classifier are also presented. Offline analysis was carried out to compare this custom classifier to de-facto machine learning algorithms, including C4.5, CART, SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Naive Bayes. A series of trials were carried out in Ireland, initially involving N = 6 individuals to test the feasibility of the system, before a final trial with N = 24 subjects took place in the Netherlands. The protocol used and analysis of 1165 mm of recorded activities from these trials are described in detail in this paper.

While these systems have good accuracy under benign settings, they suffer a severe decrease of their effectiveness when under attack by compromised nodes acting as insider attackers. Previous defenses mitigate such attacks by using machine learning techniques to differentiate good behavior (learned over time) from bad behavior. However, these defense schemes have been shown to be vulnerable to advanced attacks that make the schemes learn malicious behavior as good behavior. We present Newton, a decentralized VCS that is robust to a wide class of insider attacks. Newton uses an abstraction of a real-life physical system, similar to that of Vivaldi, but in addition uses safety invariants derived from Newton's laws of motion. As a result, Newton does not need to learn good behavior and can tolerate a significantly higher percentage of malicious nodes. We show through simulations and real-world experiments on the PlanetLab testbed that Newton is able to mitigate all known attacks against VCSs while providing better accuracy than Vivaldi, even in benign settings. Finally, we show how to design a VCS that better matches a real physical system, thus allowing for more intuitive and tighter system parameters that are even more difficult to exploit by attackers.

J	Kumar, JA; Ahmadyan, SN; Vasudevan, S				Kumar, Jayanand Asok; Ahmadyan, Seyed Nematollah; Vasudevan, Shobha			Efficient Statistical Model Checking of Hardware Circuits With Multiple Failure Regions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Importance sampling; multiple failure regions; statistical model checking (SMC); variational Bayesian inference	SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; EVENTS; DESIGN; YIELD	Statistical model checking (SMC) is a simulation-based approach for verifying the statistical properties of large, complex systems. If a large number of low-probability events (rare events) is required to be simulated, SMC is extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we present a methodology to accelerate the SMC of hardware circuits by generating rare events with a higher frequency. Unlike existing techniques, our methodology can be applied to circuits with multiple rare-event regions. We first sample the circuit uniformly to quickly generate a set of rare events. We employ variational Bayes, a variational inference technique used in machine learning, to infer the distribution of the rare events in the circuit. We then bias the statistical distribution toward these rare event regions. Finally, we employ the SMC using the biased distribution and adjust for the bias that we introduce. The use of variational Bayes enables our methodology to distinguish between multiple rare event regions in the circuit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our biasing approach on two real-world hardware circuits. We consider the analog (i.e., continuous-time) behavior of these circuits. For an SRAM memory cell, which has a single failure region, we show that our approach provides around 31x speedup over regular SMC while verifying whether the failure rate is less than 10(-4). For a successive approximation ADC circuit, which has multiple failure regions, we demonstrate a speedup of 42x while verifying whether the failure rate is less than 10(-5).

In general, a regularized estimation problem minimizes the sum of a loss function and a penalty term. The penalty term is usually weighted by a tuning parameter and encourages certain constraints on the parameters to be estimated. Particular choices of constraints lead to the popular lasso, fused-lasso, and other generalized l(1) penalized regression methods. In this article we follow a recent idea by Wu and propose an exact path solver based on ordinary differential equations (EPSODE) that works for any convex loss function and can deal with generalized l(1) penalties as well as more complicated regularization such as inequality constraints encountered in shape-restricted regressions and nonparametric density estimation. Nonasymptotic error bounds for the equality regularized estimates are derived. In practice, the EPSODE can be coupled with AIC, BIC, C-p or cross-validation to select an optimal tuning parameter, or provide a convenient model space for performing model averaging or aggregation. Our applications to generalized l(1) regularized generalized linear models, shape-restricted regressions, Gaussian graphical models, and nonparametric density estimation showcase the potential of the EPSODE algorithm.

Surprisingly, the choice probabilities arising from the family of generalized extreme value models of which the multinomial logit model is a special case can be obtained from this approach, despite the difference in assumptions on the underlying probability distributions. We use this connection to develop flexible and general choice models to incorporate consumer and product level heterogeneity in both partworths and scale parameters in the choice model. Furthermore, the extremal distributions obtained from the MDM can be used to approximate the Fisher's information matrix to obtain reliable standard error estimates of the partworth parameters, without having to bootstrap the method. We use simulated and empirical data sets to test the performance of this approach. We evaluate the performance against the classical multinomial logit, mixed logit, and a machine learning approach that accounts for partworth heterogeneity. Our numerical results indicate that MDM provides a practical semiparametric alternative to choice modeling.

The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias-variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules-the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable.

Coordination of Independent Loops in Self-Adaptive Systems	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Autonomic computing; autonomic manager; performance management	SOFTWARE; HEARTBEATS	Nowadays, the same piece of code should run on different architectures, providing performance guarantees in a variety of environments and situations. To this end, designers often integrate existing systems with ad-hoc adaptive strategies able to tune specific parameters that impact performance or energy-for example, frequency scaling. However, these strategies interfere with one another and unpredictable performance degradationmay occur due to the interaction between different entities. In this article, we propose a software approach to reconfiguration when different strategies, called loops, are encapsulated in the system and are available to be activated. Our solution to loop coordination is based on machine learning and it selects a policy for the activation of loops inside of a system without prior knowledge. We implemented our solution on top of GNU/Linux and evaluated it with a significant subset of the PARSEC benchmark suite.

Clinical evaluation is based on the visual detection of symptoms during epileptic seizures. This work aims at developing a fully automatic classifier of epileptic types and their localization using ictal symptoms and machine learning methods. Methods: We present the results achieved by using two machine learning methods. The first is an ontology-based classification that can directly incorporate human knowledge, while the second is a genetics-based data mining algorithm that learns or extracts the domain knowledge from medical data in implicit form. Results: The developed methods are tested on a clinical dataset of 129 patients. The performance of the methods is measured against the performance of seven clinicians, whose level of expertise is high/very high, in classifying two epilepsy types: temporal lobe epilepsy and extra-temporal lobe epilepsy. When comparing the performance of the algorithms with that of a single clinician, who is one of the seven clinicians, the algorithms show a slightly better performance than the clinician on three test sets generated randomly from 99 patients out of the 129 patients. The accuracy obtained for the two methods and the clinician is as follows: first test set 65.6% and 75% for the methods and 56.3% for the clinician, second test set 66.7% and 76.2% for the methods and 61.9% for the clinician, and third test set 77.8% for the methods and the clinician. When compared with the performance of the whole population of clinicians on the rest 30 patients out of the 129 patients, where the patients were selected by the clinicians themselves, the mean accuracy of the methods (60%) is slightly worse than the mean accuracy of the clinicians (61.6%). Results show that the methods perform at the level of experienced clinicians, when both the methods and the clinicians use the same information. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the developed methods form important ingredients for realizing a fully automatic classification of epilepsy types and can contribute to the definition of signs that are most important for the classification.

J	Oliva, J; Serrano, JI; del Castillo, MD; Iglesias, A				Oliva, Jesus; Ignacio Serrano, J.; Dolores del Castillo, M.; Iglesias, Angel			A methodology for the characterization and diagnosis of cognitive impairments-Application to specific language impairment	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Computational cognitive modeling; Machine learning; Specific language impairment; Automatic diagnosis	ENGLISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN; PAST TENSE; MORPHOLOGY; SPANISH; COMPREHENSION; DIFFICULTIES; DISORDER; DEFICIT; SPEECH; MEMORY	Objectives: The diagnosis of mental disorders is in most cases very difficult because of the high heterogeneity and overlap between associated cognitive impairments. Furthermore, early and individualized diagnosis is crucial. In this paper, we propose a methodology to support the individualized characterization and diagnosis of cognitive impairments. The methodology can also be used as a test platform for existing theories on the causes of the impairments. We use computational cognitive modeling to gather information on the cognitive mechanisms underlying normal and impaired behavior. We then use this information to feed machine-learning algorithms to individually characterize the impairment and to differentiate between normal and impaired behavior. We apply the methodology to the particular case of specific language impairment (SLI) in Spanish-speaking children. Methods and materials: The proposed methodology begins by defining a task in which normal and individuals with impairment present behavioral differences. Next we build a computational cognitive model of that task and individualize it: we build a cognitive model for each participant and optimize its parameter values to fit the behavior of each participant. Finally, we use the optimized parameter values to feed different machine learning algorithms. The methodology was applied to an existing database of 48 Spanish-speaking children (24 normal and 24 SLI children) using clustering techniques for the characterization, and different classifier techniques for the diagnosis. Results: The characterization results show three well-differentiated groups that can be associated with the three main theories on SLI. Using a leave-one-subject-out testing methodology, all the classifiers except the DT produced sensitivity, specificity and area under curve values above 90%, reaching 100% in some cases. Conclusions: The results show that our methodology is able to find relevant information on the underlying cognitive mechanisms and to use it appropriately to provide better diagnosis than existing techniques. It is also worth noting that the individualized characterization obtained using our methodology could be extremely helpful in designing individualized therapies. Moreover, the proposed methodology could be easily extended to other languages and even to other cognitive impairments not necessarily related to language. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A PCA-based automated finder for galaxy-scale strong lenses	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; techniques: image processing; methods: data analysis; dark matter; surveys; cosmological parameters	SPECTROSCOPICALLY SELECTED SAMPLE; COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; MASS DENSITY PROFILE; CFHT LEGACY SURVEY; GRAVITATIONAL LENSES; HIGH-REDSHIFT; STELLAR MASS; ACS SURVEY; SL2S; DARK	We present an algorithm using principal component analysis (PCA) to subtract galaxies from imaging data and also two algorithms to find strong, galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in the resulting residual image. The combined method is optimised to find full or partial Einstein rings. Starting from a pre-selection of potential massive galaxies, we first perform a PCA to build a set of basis vectors. The galaxy images are reconstructed using the PCA basis and subtracted from the data. We then filter the residual image with two different methods. The first uses a curvelet (curved wavelets) filter of the residual images to enhance any curved/ring feature. The resulting image is transformed in polar coordinates, centred on the lens galaxy. In these coordinates, a ring is turned into a line, allowing us to detect very faint rings by taking advantage of the integrated signal-to-noise in the ring (a line in polar coordinates). The second way of analysing the PCA-subtracted images identifies structures in the residual images and assesses whether they are lensed images according to their orientation, multiplicity, and elongation. We applied the two methods to a sample of simulated Einstein rings as they would be observed with the ESA Euclid satellite in the VIS band. The polar coordinate transform allowed us to reach a completeness of 90% for a purity of 86%, as soon as the signal-to-noise integrated in the ring was higher than 30 and almost independent of the size of the Einstein ring. Finally, we show with real data that our PCA-based galaxy subtraction scheme performs better than traditional subtraction based on model fitting to the data. Our algorithm can be developed and improved further using machine learning and dictionary learning methods, which would extend the capabilities of the method to more complex and diverse galaxy shapes.

In this paper, we present the first result of the classification of periodic variable stars in the EROS-2 LMC database. To classify these variables, we first built a training set by compiling known variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud area from the OGLE and MACHO surveys. We crossmatched these variables with the EROS-2 sources and extracted 22 variability features from 28 392 light curves of the corresponding EROS-2 sources. We then used the random forest method to classify the EROS-2 sources in the training set. We designed the model to separate not only delta Scuti stars, RR Lyraes, Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and long-period variables, the superclasses, but also their subclasses, such as RRab, RRc, RRd, and RRe for RR Lyraes, and similarly for the other variable types. The model trained using only the superclasses shows 99% recall and precision, while the model trained on all subclasses shows 87% recall and precision. We applied the trained model to the entire EROS-2 LMC database, which contains about 29 million sources, and found 117 234 periodic variable candidates. Out of these 117 234 periodic variables, 55 285 have not been discovered by either OGLE or MACHO variability studies. This set comprises 1906 delta Scuti stars, 6607 RR Lyraes, 638 Cepheids, 178 Type II Cepheids, 34 562 eclipsing binaries, and 11 394 long-period variables.	[Kim, Dae-Won; Bailer-Jones, Coryn A.

J	Lu, Y; Deng, JY; Rhodes, JC; Lu, H; Lu, LJ				Lu, Yao; Deng, Jingyuan; Rhodes, Judith C.; Lu, Hui; Lu, Long Jason			Predicting essential genes for identifying potential drug targets in Aspergillus fumigatus	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Aspergillus fumigatus; Fungi; Essential genes; Drug targets; Machine learning; Integrative	PROTEIN NETWORKS; EXPRESSION PROFILES; EFFECTIVE NUMBER; IDENTIFICATION; DATABASE; GENOMES; MUTAGENESIS; DEFICIENT; VIABILITY; DISCOVERY	Background: Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is a ubiquitous and opportunistic pathogen capable of causing acute, invasive pulmonary disease in susceptible hosts. Despite current therapeutic options, mortality associated with invasive Af infections remains unacceptably high, increasing 357% since 1980. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including more efficacious drugs acting on new targets. Thus, as noted in a recent review, "the identification of essential genes in fungi represents a crucial step in the development of new antifungal drugs". Expanding the target space by rapidly identifying new essential genes has thus been described as "the most important task of genomics-based target validation". Results: In previous research, we were the first to show that essential gene annotation can be reliably transferred between distantly related four Prokaryotic species. In this study, we extend our machine learning approach to the much more complex Eukaryotic fungal species. A compendium of essential genes is predicted in Af by transferring known essential gene annotations from another filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. This approach predicts essential genes by integrating diverse types of intrinsic and context-dependent genomic features encoded in microbial genomes. The predicted essential datasets contained 1674 genes. We validated our results by comparing our predictions with known essential genes in Af, comparing our predictions with those predicted by homology mapping, and conducting conditional expressed alleles. We applied several layers of filters and selected a set of potential drug targets from the predicted essential genes. Finally, we have conducted wet lab knockout experiments to verify our predictions, which further validates the accuracy and wide applicability of the machine learning approach. Conclusions: The approach presented here significantly extended our ability to predict essential genes beyond orthologs and made it possible to predict an inventory of essential genes in Eukaryotic fungal species, amongst which a preferred subset of suitable drug targets may be selected. By selecting the best new targets, we believe that resultant drugs would exhibit an unparalleled clinical impact against a naive pathogen population. Additional benefits that a compendium of essential genes can provide are important information on cell function and evolutionary biology. Furthermore, mapping essential genes to pathways may also reveal critical check points in the pathogen's metabolism. Finally, this approach is highly reproducible and portable, and can be easily applied to predict essential genes in many more pathogenic microbes, especially those unculturable.

We develop an automated fall detection system with wearable motion sensor units fitted to the subjects' body at six different positions. Each unit comprises three tri-axial devices (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer/compass). Fourteen volunteers perform a standardized set of movements including 20 voluntary falls and 16 activities of daily living (ADLs), resulting in a large dataset with 2520 trials. To reduce the computational complexity of training and testing the classifiers, we focus on the raw data for each sensor in a 4 s time window around the point of peak total acceleration of the waist sensor, and then perform feature extraction and reduction. Most earlier studies on fall detection employ rule-based approaches that rely on simple thresholding of the sensor outputs. We successfully distinguish falls from ADLs using six machine learning techniques (classifiers): the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, least squares method (LSM), support vector machines (SVM), Bayesian decision making (BDM), dynamic time warping (DTW), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). We compare the performance and the computational complexity of the classifiers and achieve the best results with the k-NN classifier and LSM, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy all above 99%. These classifiers also have acceptable computational requirements for training and testing. Our approach would be applicable in real-world scenarios where data records of indeterminate length, containing multiple activities in sequence, are recorded.

A Machine Learning Approach to Improving Dynamic Decision Making	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						dynamic decision making; process control; data mining; process mining; machine learning; simulation; healthcare	DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS; CLINICAL INERTIA; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; MODEL; CARE	Decision strategies in dynamic environments do not always succeed in producing desired outcomes, particularly in complex, ill-structured domains. Information systems often capture large amounts of data about such environments. We propose a domain-independent, iterative approach that (a) applies data mining classification techniques to the collected data in order to discover the conditions under which dynamic decision-making strategies produce undesired or suboptimal outcomes and (b) uses this information to improve the decision strategy under these conditions. In this paper, we formally develop this approach and illustrate it by providing detailed examples of its application to a chronic disease care problem in a healthcare management organization, specifically the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In particular, the proposed iterative approach is used to improve treatment strategies by predicting and eliminating treatment failures, i.e., insufficient or excessive treatment actions, based on information that is available in electronic medical record systems. We also apply the proposed approach to a manufacturing task, resulting in substantial decision strategy improvements, which further demonstrates the generality and flexibility of the proposed approach.

The use of modified proteins is increasingly widespread: their presence in food, commercial products, such as washing powder, and medical therapeutics and diagnostics, makes predicting and identifying potential allergens a crucial societal issue. The prediction of allergens has been explored widely using bioinformatics, with many tools being developed in the last decade; many of these are freely available online. Here, we report a set of novel models for allergen prediction utilizing amino acid E-descriptors, auto-and cross-covariance transformation, and several machine learning methods for classification, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and k nearest neighbours (kNN). The best performing method was kNN with 85.3 % accuracy at 5-fold cross-validation. The resulting model has been implemented in a revised version of the AllerTOP server (http://www. ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP).

Learning decision rules for energy efficient building control	JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL			English	Article						Model predictive control; Rule based control; Learning; Support vector machine (SVM); AdaBoost	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TUTORIAL	While rule based control (RBC) is current practice in most building automation systems that issue discrete control signals, recent simulation studies suggest that advanced, optimization based control methods such as hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) can potentially outperform RBC in terms of energy efficiency and occupancy comfort. However, HMPC requires a more complex IT infrastructure and numerical optimization in the loop, which makes commissioning, operation of the building, and error handling significantly more involved than in the rule based setting. In this paper, we suggest an automated RBC synthesis procedure for binary decisions that extracts prevalent information from simulation data with HMPC controllers. The result is a set of simple decision rules that preserves much of the control performance of HMPC. The methods are based on standard machine learning algorithms, in particular support vector machines (SVMs) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). We consider also the ranking and selection of measurements which are used for a decision and show that this feature selection is useful in both complexity reduction and reduction of investment costs by pruning unnecessary sensors. The suggested methods are evaluated in simulation for six different case studies and shown to maintain the performance of HMPC despite a tremendous reduction in complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Uhlmann, S; Kiranyaz, S; Gabbouj, M				Uhlmann, Stefan; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Gabbouj, Moncef			Semi-Supervised Learning for Ill-Posed Polarimetric SAR Classification	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						semi-supervised; machine learning; ensemble; SAR; superpixel	IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; SEMISUPERVISED SVM; SAMPLES; ENSEMBLE	In recent years, the interest in semi-supervised learning has increased, combining supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. This is especially valid for classification applications in remote sensing, while the data acquisition rate in current systems has become fairly large considering high-and very-high resolution data; yet on the other hand, the process of obtaining the ground truth data may be cumbersome for such large repositories. In this paper, we investigate the application of semi-supervised learning approaches and particularly focus on the small sample size problem. To that extend, we consider two basic unsupervised approaches by enlarging the initial labeled training set as well as an ensemble-based self-training method. We propose different strategies within self-training on how to select more reliable candidates from the pool of unlabeled samples to speed-up the learning process and to improve the classification performance of the underlying classifier ensemble. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised learning approach over polarimetric SAR data. Results show that the proposed self-training approach using an ensemble-based classifier that is initially trained over a small training set can achieve a similar performance level of a fully supervised learning approach where the training is performed over significantly larger labeled data. Considering the difficulties of the manual data labeling in such massive volumes of SAR repositories, this is indeed a promising accomplishment for semi-supervised SAR classification.

Crop discrimination via remote sensing is a complex task, especially if different crops have a similar spectral response and cropping pattern. In such cases, crop identification could be improved by combining object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods. In this investigation, we evaluated the C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network methods, both as single classifiers and combined in a hierarchical classification, for the mapping of nine major summer crops (both woody and herbaceous) from ASTER satellite images captured in two different dates. Each method was built with different combinations of spectral and textural features obtained after the segmentation of the remote images in an object-based framework. As single classifiers, MLP and SVM obtained maximum overall accuracy of 88%, slightly higher than LR (86%) and notably higher than C4.5 (79%). The SVM+SVM classifier (best method) improved these results to 89%. In most cases, the hierarchical classifiers considerably increased the accuracy of the most poorly classified class (minimum sensitivity). The SVM+SVM method offered a significant improvement in classification accuracy for all of the studied crops compared to the conventional decision tree classifier, ranging between 4% for safflower and 29% for corn, which suggests the application of object-based image analysis and advanced machine learning methods in complex crop classification tasks.

Ensemble algorithms for ecological niche modeling from presence-background and presence-only data	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						ecological niche model; ensemble methods; Gadopsis bispinosus; LOBAG; LOBAG-OC; machine learning; presence-only model; species distribution model; support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HABITAT-SUITABILITY; ABSENCE DATA; EXPLANATION; PREDICTION; BIAS	Ecological niche modeling is central to many problems in population dynamics, conservation biology, biogeography, and evolutionary ecology. Recently, methodological advances have been achieved by adopting modeling principles from statistical and machine learning. One such principle that has not been explored is that voted ensembles of weakly tuned (underfit) models often exhibit similar bias and lower variance than individual well-tuned models. A further contribution of machine learning is the one class support vector machine. One class support vector machines may be more suited to ecological niche modeling than classification algorithms because the "boundary estimation'' property of this class of models better represents the conception of the niche as the set of environments in which populations of a species persist. This paper brings together these approaches and applies them to a data set on the distribution two-spined blackfish (Gadopsis bispinosus) in southeastern Australia with the aim of improving performance and enriching the repertoire of methods for ecological niche modeling. First, a study of low-bias bagging (LOBAG) applied to conventional two-class support vector machines, an approach to presence-background modeling, found this method to be comparable to another widely used method, MAXENT. Next, I introduce a variant of LOBAG for one class classification, LOBAG-OC, to be used for ecological niche modeling with presence-only data. This method performed better than other presence-only methods (DOMAIN and BIOCLIM) and nearly as well as LOBAG and MAXENT, despite the fact that the presence-only problem is considerably more difficult than the corresponding presence-background problem. Results of these analyses suggest that LOBAG and LOBAG-OC may provide robust, high-performing solutions to the presence-background and presence-only modeling problems and point to ways in which ecological niche modeling may be simultaneously both improved and automated.

However, many scientists have not accepted the data deluge as an integral part of their research because the current scientific method is not scalable to large, complex datasets. Here, we explain how integrating a data-intensive, machine learning approach with a hypothesis-driven, mechanistic approach can lead to a novel knowledge, learning, analysis system (KLAS) for discovery and problem solving. Machine learning leads to more efficient, user-friendly analytics as the streams of data increase while hypothesis-driven decisions lead to the strategic design of experiments to fill knowledge gaps and to elucidate mechanisms. KLAS will transform ecology and environmental sciences by shortening the time lag between individual discoveries and leaps in knowledge by the scientific community, and will lead to paradigm shifts predicated on open access data and analytics in a machine learning environment.

Leon			Effective Active Learning Strategies for the Use of Large-Margin Classifiers in Semantic Annotation: An Optimal Parameter Discovery Perspective	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						active learning; machine learning; data mining; optimization; business intelligence	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CONDITIONAL RANDOM-FIELDS; CLASSIFICATION; WEB; ACQUISITION; EXTRACTION; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; VARIABLES; SEARCH	Classical supervised machine learning techniques have been explored for semantically annotating unstructured textual data such as consumers' comments archived at social media websites to extract business intelligence. However, these techniques often require a large number of manually labeled training examples to produce accurate annotations. Several active learning approaches that are designed based on probabilistic sequence models have been explored to minimize the number of labeled training examples for semantic annotation tasks. Recent research has shown that large-margin classifiers are viable alternatives to automated semantic annotation, given their strong generalization capabilities and the ability to process high-dimensional data. However, the existing active learning methods that are designed for probabilistic sequence models cannot be easily adapted and applied to large-margin classifiers. The main contribution of this paper is the development of novel active learning methods for large-margin classifiers to fill the aforementioned research gap. In particular, we propose an innovative perspective of taking active learning as a search of optimal parameters for large-margin classifiers. A rigorous evaluation involving two benchmark tests and an empirical test based on real-world data extracted from Amazon.com reveals that the proposed active learning methods can train effective classifiers with significantly fewer training examples while achieving similar annotation performance, compared to a typical state-of-the-art classifier that only uses several labeled training examples. More specifically, one of our proposed active learning methods can reduce the number of training examples by 19.74% at the 68% level of F 1 when compared to the best baseline method, as evaluated based on the Amazon data set. Our research opens the door to the application of intelligent semantic annotation techniques to support real-world applications such as automatically analyzing consumer comments for customer relationship management.

A determination of critical factors that influence performance in such courses is critical to designing class instructions. Instructors teaching these classes agonize over the fact that these courses are amongst the most difficult to teach as they encompass relatively harder concepts transformed into analytical skill sets with real applications to business operations that students struggle to grasp. This study employs a machine learning-based approach to determine critical success factors by analyzing the dataset of a focus course and provides some guidelines to educators for improving their teaching effectiveness. Information fusion-based sensitivity analyses on the data mining models provide an unbiased weighting scheme for the rank order of the variables that help predict the students' comprehension level.

Negative examples are required, however, for several of the most powerful machine learning methods for integrative protein function prediction. Most protein function prediction efforts have relied on a variety of heuristics for the choice of negative examples. Determining the accuracy of methods for negative example prediction is itself a non-trivial task, given that the Open World Assumption as applied to gene annotations rules out many traditional validation metrics. We present a rigorous comparison of these heuristics, utilizing a temporal holdout, and a novel evaluation strategy for negative examples. We add to this comparison several algorithms adapted from Positive-Unlabeled learning scenarios in text-classification, which are the current state of the art methods for generating negative examples in low-density annotation contexts. Lastly, we present two novel algorithms of our own construction, one based on empirical conditional probability, and the other using topic modeling applied to genes and annotations. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve significantly fewer incorrect negative example predictions than the current state of the art, using multiple benchmarks covering multiple organisms. Our methods may be applied to generate negative examples for any type of method that deals with protein function, and to this end we provide a database of negative examples in several well-studied organisms, for general use (The NoGO database, available at: bonneaulab.bio.nyu.edu/nogo.html).

An important yet challenging task in developing and applying default classification models is model evaluation and selection. This study proposes an evaluation approach for bank loan default classification models based on multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. A large real-life Chinese bank loan dataset is used to validate the proposed approach. Specifically, a set of performance metrics is utilized to measure a selection of statistical and machine-learning default models. The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a MCDM method, takes the performances of default classification models on multiple performance metrics as inputs to generate a ranking of default risk models. In addition, feature selection and sampling techniques are applied to the data pre-processing step to handle high dimensionality and class unbalancedness of bank loan default data. The results show that K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm has a good potential in bank loan default prediction.

Every year, data collected from biomedical and behavioral science is getting larger and more complicated. Thus, in medicine, we also need to be aware of this trend and understand the statistical tools that are available to analyze these datasets. Many statistical analyses that are aimed to analyze such big datasets have been introduced recently. However, given many different types of clinical, genomic, and environmental data, it is rather uncommon to see statistical methods that combine knowledge resulting from those different data types. To this extent, we will introduce big data in terms of clinical data, single nucleotide polymorphism and gene expression studies and their interactions with environment. In this article, we will introduce the concept of well-known regression analyses such as linear and logistic regressions that has been widely used in clinical data analyses and modern statistical models such as Bayesian networks that has been introduced to analyze more complicated data. Also we will discuss how to represent the interaction among clinical, genomic, and environmental data in using modern statistical models. We conclude this article with a promising modern statistical method called Bayesian networks that is suitable in analyzing big data sets that consists with different type of large data from clinical, genomic, and environmental data. Such statistical model form big data will provide us with more comprehensive understanding of human physiology and disease.

The second step involves the classification task using an efficient classifier. In this paper we use the three efficient machine learning classifiers such as Fast Support Vector Machine Learning (FSVML), Fast Extreme Learning Machine Learning (FELML) and Relevance Vector Machine Learning (RVMMLML). The investigational values are computed using three datasets namely Lymphoma, Leukemia and SRBCT. The results are interpreted in terms of Testing Accuracy and Training Time. From the investigational results, it is observed that the proposed RVMMLML machine learning approach gives better testing accuracy results for all the datasets considered.

It has a crucial role in linear discriminant analysis and has many other applications in computer vision and machine learning as well. In this short note, we first establish the classical first and second order optimality conditions for TRP. As a straightforward application of these optimality conditions, we contribute a simple proof for the property that TRP does not admit local non-global maximizer, which is first proved by Shen et al.

Multiparametric Analysis of Screening Data: Growing Beyond the Single Dimension to Infinity and Beyond	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Review						multiparametric data analysis; multiparametric visualization; high-content screening; machine learning; cell-based screening	DRUG DISCOVERY; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; DATA SETS; Z' FACTOR; MASS CYTOMETRY; VISUALIZATION; ASSAY; CELLS; RESPONSES; MICROSCOPY	Advances in instrumentation now allow the development of screening assays that are capable of monitoring multiple readouts such as transcript or protein levels, or even multiple parameters derived from images. Such advances in assay technologies highlight the complex nature of biology and disease. Harnessing this complexity requires integration of all the different parameters that can be measured rather than just monitoring a single dimension as is commonly used. Although some of the methods used to combine multiple measurements, such as principal component analysis, are commonly used for microarray analysis, biologists are not yet using many of the tools that have been developed in other fields to address such issues. Visualization of multiparametric data sets is one of the major challenges in this field, and a depiction of the results in a manner that can be readily interpreted is essential. This article describes a number of assay systems being used to generate such data sets en masse, and the methods being applied to their visualization and analysis. We also discuss some of the challenges of applying methods developed in other fields to biology.

Increasingly, high-content screens have come to rely on supervised machine learning (SML) to perform automatic phenotypic classification as an essential step of the analysis. However, this comes at a cost, namely, the labeled examples required to train the predictive model. Classification performance increases with the number of labeled examples, and because labeling examples demands time from an expert, the training process represents a significant time investment. Active learning strategies attempt to overcome this bottleneck by presenting the most relevant examples to the annotator, thereby achieving high accuracy while minimizing the cost of obtaining labeled data. In this article, we investigate the impact of active learning on single-cell-based phenotype recognition, using data from three large-scale RNA interference high-content screens representing diverse phenotypic profiling problems. We consider several combinations of active learning strategies and popular SML methods. Our results show that active learning significantly reduces the time cost and can be used to reveal the same phenotypic targets identified using SML. We also identify combinations of active learning strategies and SML methods which perform better than others on the phenotypic profiling problems we studied.

Existing sentiment analysis methods often assume that the comments of any single reviewer are independent of each other and so they do not take advantage of significant information that may be extracted from reviewers' comment histories. Using psychological findings and the theory of negativity bias, we propose a method for exploiting reviewers' comment histories to improve sentiment analysis. Furthermore, to use more fine-grained information about the content of a review, our method predicts the overall ratings by aggregating sentence-level scores. In the proposed system, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is utilized for score aggregation. The results from four large and diverse social Web datasets establish the superiority of our approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. In addition, the results show that the suggested method is robust to the size of training dataset.

Light-Power NUCA (LP-NUCA) is a working-set adaptive cache that depends on temporal-locality to save energy This work identifies the sources of energy waste in LP-NUCAs: parallel access to the tag and data arrays of the tiles and low locality phases with useless block migration. To counteract both issues, we prove that switching to serial access reduces energy without harming performance and propose a machine learning Adaptive Drop Rate (ADR) controller that minimizes the amount of replacement and migration when locality is low. This work demonstrates that these techniques efficiently adapt the cache drop and access policies to save energy They reduce LP-NUCA consumption 22.7% for 1SMT. With interthread cache contention in 2SMT, the savings rise to 29%. Versus a conventional organization, energy-delay improves 20.8% and 25% for 1- and 2SMT benchmarks, and, in 65% of the 2SMT mixes, gains are larger than 20%.

However, such SoC architectures can be very challenging to efficiently program for the vast majority of programmers, due to numerous programming approaches and languages. Libraries, on the other hand, provide a simple way to let programmers take advantage of complex architectures, which does not require programmers to acquire new accelerator-specific or domain-specific languages. Increasingly, library-based, also called algorithm-centric, programming approaches propose to generalize the usage of libraries and to compose programs around these libraries, instead of using libraries as mere complements. In this article, we present a software framework for achieving performance portability by leveraging a generalized library-based approach. Inspired by the notion of a component, as employed in software engineering and HW/SW codesign, we advocate nonexpert programmers to write simple wrapper code around existing libraries to provide simple but necessary semantic information to the runtime. To achieve performance portability, the runtime employs machine learning (simulated annealing) to select the most appropriate accelerator and its parameters for a given algorithm. This selection factors in the possibly complex composition of algorithms used in the application, the communication among the various accelerators, and the tradeoff between different objectives (i.e., accuracy, performance, and energy). Using a set of benchmarks run on a real heterogeneous SoC composed of a multicore processor and a GPU, we show that the runtime overhead is fairly small at 5.1% for the GPU and 6.4% for the multi-core. We then apply our accelerator selection approach to a simulated SoC platform containing multiple inexact accelerators. We show that accelerator selection together with hardware parameter tuning achieves an average 46.2% energy reduction and a speedup of 2.1 x while meeting the desired application error target.

Human beings perceive a larger association between causal than diagnostic relationships. This psychological principal can be used to orient the arcs within Bayesian networks by prohibiting the direction that is less predictive. The heuristic increased predictive accuracy by an average of 0.51 % percent, a small amount. It also increased total agreement between different network learning algorithms (Max Spanning Tree, Taboo, EQ, SopLeq, and Taboo Order) by 25 %. Prior to use of the heuristic, the multiple raters Kappa between the algorithms was 0.60 (95 % confidence interval, CI, from 0.53 to 0.67) indicating moderate agreement among the networks learned through different algorithms. After the use of the heuristic, the multiple raters Kappa was 0.85 (95% CI from 0.78 to 0.92). There was a statistically significant increase in agreement between the five algorithms (alpha < 0.05). These data suggest that the heuristic increased agreement between networks learned through use of different algorithms, without loss of predictive accuracy. Additional research is needed to see if findings persist in other data sets and to explain why a heuristic used by humans could improve construct validity of mathematical algorithms.

However, it has been known for some time that nonlinear spectral mixing effects can be a crucial component in many real-world scenarios, such as planetary remote sensing, intimate mineral mixtures, vegetation canopies, or urban scenes. While several nonlinear mixing models have been proposed decades ago, only recently there has been a proliferation of nonlinear unmixing models and techniques in the signal processing literature. This paper aims to give an historical overview of the majority of nonlinear mixing models and nonlinear unmixing methods, and to explain some of the more popular techniques in detail. The main models and techniques treated are bilinear models, models for intimate mineral mixtures, radiosity-based approaches, ray tracing, neural networks, kernel methods, support vector machine techniques, manifold learning methods, piece-wise linear techniques, and detection methods for nonlinearity. Furthermore, we provide an overview of several recent developments in the nonlinear unmixing literature that do not belong into any of these categories.

Jeffrey			Comparative Sensor Fusion Between Hyperspectral and Multispectral Satellite Sensors for Monitoring Microcystin Distribution in Lake Erie	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Harmful algal bloom; image fusion; machine learning; microcystin; remote sensing	LANDSAT SURFACE REFLECTANCE; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS	Urban growth and agricultural production have caused an influx of nutrients into Lake Erie, leading to eutrophication in the water body. These conditions result in the formation of algal blooms, some of which are toxic due to the presence of Microcystis (a cyanobacteria), which produces the hepatotoxin microcystin. The hepatotoxin microcystin threatens human health and the ecosystem, and it is a concern for water treatment plants using the lake water as a tap water source. This study demonstrates the prototype of a near real-time early warning system using integrated data fusion and mining (IDFM) techniques with the aid of both hyperspectral (MERIS) and multispectral (MODIS and Landsat) satellite sensors to determine spatiotemporal microcystin concentrations in Lake Erie. In the proposed IDFM, the MODIS images with high temporal resolution are fused with the MERIS and Landsat images with higher spatial resolution to create synthetic images on a daily basis. The spatiotemporal distributions of microcystin within western Lake Erie were then reconstructed using the band data from the fused products with machine learning or data mining techniques such as genetic programming (GP) models. The performance of the data mining models derived using fused hyperspectral and fused multispectral sensor data are quantified using four statistical indices. These data mining models were further compared with traditional two-band models in terms of microcystin prediction accuracy. This study confirmed that GP models outperformed traditional two-band models, and additional spectral reflectance data offered by hyperspectral sensors produces a noticeable increase in the prediction accuracy especially in the range of low microcystin concentrations.

Classification of Australian Native Forest Species Using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and Machine-Learning Classification Algorithms	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Forestry; remote sensing	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; EUCALYPT VEGETATION; LEAF REFLECTANCE; IMAGERY; RECOGNITION; PLANTS; TREES	Mapping forest species is highly relevant for many ecological and forestry applications. In Australia, the classification of native forest species using remote sensing data remains a particular challenge since there are many eucalyptus species that belong to the same genus and, thus, exhibit similar biophysical characteristics. This study assessed the potential of using hyperspectral remote sensing data and state-of-the-art machine-learning classification algorithms to classify Australian forest species at the leaf, canopy and community levels in Beecroft Peninsula, NSW, Australia. Spectral reflectance was acquired from an ASD spectrometer and airborne Hymap imagery for seven native forest species over an Australian eucalyptus forest. Three machine-learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost and Random Forest (RF) were applied to classify the species. A comparative study was carried out between machine-learning classification algorithms and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The classification results show that all machine-leaning classification algorithms significantly improve the results produced by LDA. At the leaf level, RF achieved the best classification accuracy (94.7%), and SVM outperformed the other algorithms at both the canopy (84.5%) and community levels (75.5%).

Despite their established use as a computationally efficient alternative to sampling-based methods, their practical application in mathematical psychology has so far been limited. In this tutorial we attempt to provide an introductory overview of the theoretical underpinnings that the variational Bayesian approach to latent stochastic time-series models rests on by discussing its application in the linear case.

A Survey on Class Imbalance Learning on Automatic Visual Inspection	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Spanish	Article						Automatic visual inspection; Class imbalance learning; Classifiers ensemble; Cost-sensitive learning; One Class Classification	VECTOR DATA DESCRIPTION; DEFECT DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; VISION; SMOTE	The supervised machine learning has been showing very useful for the automatic visual inspection task. However, little has been considered about use traditional machine learning techniques on a domain where the classes are imbalanced. This problem corresponds to dealing with the situation where one class outnumbers the other. Traditional machine learning algorithms trained with imbalance datasets can be biased towards the majority class, thus producing poor predictive accuracy over the minority class. In this paper, we present different approaches to address the class imbalance problem and how these approaches have been used in the context of automatic visual inspection. The literature shows there are few works that consider the class imbalance problem on automatic visual inspection task and it shows that the one class classification technique is the most used.

J	Sidhu, G; Caffo, B				Sidhu, Gagan; Caffo, Brian			MONEYBARL: EXPLOITING PITCHER DECISION-MAKING USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Markov; baseball; sports; simulation; algorithmic statistics	BASEBALL	This manuscript uses machine learning techniques to exploit baseball pitchers' decision making, so-called "Baseball IQ," by modeling the at-bat information, pitch selection and counts, as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Each state of the MDP models the pitcher's current pitch selection in a Markovian fashion, conditional on the information immediately prior to making the current pitch. This includes the count prior to the previous pitch, his ensuing pitch selection, the batter's ensuing action and the result of the pitch. The necessary Markovian probabilities can be estimated by the relevant observed conditional proportions in MLB pitch-by-pitch game data. These probabilities could be pitcher-specific, using only the data from one pitcher, or general, using the data from a collection of pitchers. Optimal batting strategies against these estimated conditional distributions of pitch selection can be ascertained by Value Iteration. Optimal batting strategies against a pitcher-specific conditional distribution can be contrasted to those calculated from the general conditional distributions associated with a collection of pitchers. In this manuscript, a single season of MLB data is used to calculate the conditional distributions to find optimal pitcher-specific and general (against a collection of pitchers) batting strategies. These strategies are subsequently evaluated by conditional distributions calculated from a different season for the same pitchers. Thus, the batting strategies are conceptually tested via a collection of simulated games, a "mock season," governed by distributions not used to create the strategies. (Simulation is not needed, as exact calculations are available.) Instances where the pitcher-specific batting strategy outperforms the general batting strategy suggests that the pitcher is exploitable-knowledge of the conditional distributions of their pitch-making decision process in a different season yielded a strategy that worked better in a new season than a general batting strategy built on a population of pitchers. A permutation-based test of exploitability of the collection of pitchers is given and evaluated under two sets of assumptions. To show the practical utility of the approach, we introduce a spatial component that classifies each pitcher's pitch-types using a batter-parameterized spatial trajectory for each pitch. We found that heuristically labeled "nonelite" batters benefit from using the exploited pitchers' pitcher-specific strategies, whereas (also heuristically labeled) "elite" players do not.

While much recent research has focused on developing automatic methods for filtering and summarizing these data streams, we explore a different trend called social curation. In contrast to automatic methods, social curation is characterized as a human-in-the-loop and sometimes crowd-sourced mechanism for exploiting social media as sensors. Although social curation web services like Togetter, Naver Matome and Storify are gaining popularity, little academic research has studied the phenomenon. In this paper, our goal is to investigate the phenomenon and potential of this new field of social curation. First, we perform an in-depth analysis of a large corpus of curated tnicroblog data. We seek to understand why and how people participate in this laborious curation process. We then explore new ways in which information retrieval and machine learning technologies can be used to assist curators. In particular, we propose a novel method based on a learning-to-rank framework that increases the curator's productivity and breadth of perspective by suggesting which novel microblogs should be added to the curated content.

However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.

Our model represents the probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each question's intrinsic difficulty. We estimate these factors given the graded responses to a collection of questions. The underlying estimation problem is ill-posed in general, especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts. Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution and a Bayesian solution to the resulting SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) problem. We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we make a connection between SPARFA and noisy, binary-valued (1-bit) dictionary learning that is of independent interest.

In terms of log likelihood on real-valued data they are comparable with the best performing techniques published, easily outperforming more advanced ones, such as deep belief networks. They can be applied to various image processing tasks, such as image denoising, deblurring and inpainting, where they improve on other generic prior methods, such as sparse coding and field of experts. Based on this we propose the use of another, even richer mixture model based image prior: the Student-t mixture model (STM). We demonstrate that it convincingly surpasses GMMs in terms of log likelihood, achieving performance competitive with the state of the art in image patch modeling. We apply both the GMM and STM to the task of lossy and lossless image compression, and propose efficient coding schemes that can easily be extended to other unsupervised machine learning models. Finally, we show that the suggested techniques outperform JPEG, with results comparable to or better than JPEG 2000.

In these applications, the test-time CPU cost must be budgeted and accounted for. In this paper, we examine two main components of the test-time CPU cost, classifier evaluation cost and feature extraction cost, and show how to balance these costs with the classifier accuracy. Since the computation required for feature extraction dominates the test-time cost of a classifier in these settings, we develop two algorithms to efficiently balance the performance with the test-time cost. Our first contribution describes how to construct and optimize a tree of classifiers, through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. Our second contribution is a natural reduction of the tree of classifiers into a cascade. The cascade is particularly useful for class-imbalanced data sets as the majority of instances can be early-exited out of the cascade when the algorithm is sufficiently confident in its prediction. Because both approaches only compute features for inputs that benefit from them the most, we find our trained classifiers lead to high accuracies at a small fraction of the computational cost.

We genotyped the above five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Han Chinese populations and performed thyroid cancer-risk predictions with nine machine learning methods. We found that four SNPs were significantly associated with thyroid cancer in Han Chinese population, while no polymorphism was observed for rs116909374. Small familial relative risks (1.02-1.05) and limited power to predict thyroid cancer (AUCs: 0.54-0.60) indicate limited clinical potential. Four significant SNPs have limited prediction ability for thyroid cancer.

A framework for imprecise robust one-class classification models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Machine learning; Novelty detection; Classification; Minimax strategy; Support vector machine; Quadratic programming	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NOVELTY DETECTION; ANOMALY DETECTION; REGULARIZATION	A framework for constructing robust one-class classification models is proposed in the paper. It is based on Walley's imprecise extensions of contaminated models which produce a set of probability distributions of data points instead of a single empirical distribution. The minimax and minimin strategies are used to choose an optimal probability distribution from the set and to construct optimal separating functions. It is shown that an algorithm for computing optimal parameters is determined by extreme points of the probability set and is reduced to a finite number of standard SVM tasks with weighted data points. Important special cases of the models, including pari-mutuel, constant odd-ratio, contaminated models and Kolmogorov-Smirnov bounds are studied. Experimental results with synthetic and real data illustrate the proposed models.

Such high-dimensional data is by its very nature often quite difficult to handle by conventional machine-learning algorithms. This is considered to be an aspect of the well known curse of dimensionality. Consequently, high-dimensional data needs to be processed with care, which is why the design of machine-learning algorithms needs to take these factors into account. Furthermore, it was observed that some of the arising high-dimensional properties could in fact be exploited in improving overall algorithm design. One such phenomenon, related to nearest-neighbor learning methods, is known as hubness and refers to the emergence of very influential nodes (hubs) in k-nearest neighbor graphs. A crisp weighted voting scheme for the k-nearest neighbor classifier has recently been proposed which exploits this notion. In this paper we go a step further by embracing the soft approach, and propose several fuzzy measures for k-nearest neighbor classification, all based on hubness, which express fuzziness of elements appearing in k-neighborhoods of other points. Experimental evaluation on real data from the UCI repository and the image domain suggests that the fuzzy approach provides a useful measure of confidence in the predicted labels, resulting in improvement over the crisp weighted method, as well as the standard kNN classifier.

This study used emotionally inflected standard-content speech segments expressing 11 emotions produced by 100 professional actors from 5 English-speaking cultures. Machine learning simulations were employed to classify expressions based on their acoustic features, using conditions where training and testing were conducted on stimuli coming from either the same or different cultures. A wide range of emotions were classified with above-chance accuracy in cross-cultural conditions, suggesting vocal expressions share important characteristics across cultures. However, classification showed an in-group advantage with higher accuracy in within-versus cross-cultural conditions. This finding demonstrates cultural differences in expressive vocal style, and supports the dialect theory of emotions according to which greater recognition of expressions from in-group members results from greater familiarity with culturally specific expressive styles.

However, user localization is by far one of the oldest and most difficult issues, due to its dynamism and to unavailability of some technologies in indoor environments. The enhanced localization solution (ELS) proposed in this paper is an innovative self adaptive solution that smartly combines standard location tracking techniques (e.g., GPS, GSM and WiFi localization), newly built-in technologies, as well as human mobility modelling and machine learning techniques. The main purposes of this solution are: to reduce the impact the service has, on the mobile device resources usage (mainly the battery consumption), when it is asked to provide a continuous localization; to help in preserving the privacy of the user, by running the whole system on the mobile device, without relying on a back-end server; and furthermore, to offer an ubiquitous coverage. The aspects mainly explored in this paper are: location prediction and mobility modelling, required to optimally estimate the current location with ELS. We are finding that people tend to move, for most of the time, among a limited set of places and that this can be modelled with a user prediction graph, which is further used to predict the next movement. Performing experiments on real users data, we show that the proposed prediction and the mobility model method of ELS are able to successfully predict the next location, even if we do not account for time features.

J	Stenetorp, P; Pyysalo, S; Ananiadou, S; Tsujii, J				Stenetorp, Pontus; Pyysalo, Sampo; Ananiadou, Sophia; Tsujii, Jun'ichi			Generalising semantic category disambiguation with large lexical resources for fun and profit	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS			English	Article						Semantic category disambiguation; Approximate string matching; Lexical resources; Named entity recognition; Domain adaptation; Freebase	INFORMATION EXTRACTION; BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE; CORPUS; SYSTEM; TEXT; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION; DICTIONARY; LANGUAGE; GENE	Background: Semantic Category Disambiguation (SCD) is the task of assigning the appropriate semantic category to given spans of text from a fixed set of candidate categories, for example PROTEIN to "Fibrin". SCD is relevant to Natural Language Processing tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, coreference resolution and coordination resolution. In this work, we study machine learning-based SCD methods using large lexical resources and approximate string matching, aiming to generalise these methods with regard to domains, lexical resources and the composition of data sets. We specifically consider the applicability of SCD for the purposes of supporting human annotators and acting as a pipeline component for other Natural Language Processing systems. Results: While previous research has mostly cast SCD purely as a classification task, we consider a task setting that allows for multiple semantic categories to be suggested, aiming to minimise the number of suggestions while maintaining high recall. We argue that this setting reflects aspects which are essential for both a pipeline component and when supporting human annotators. We introduce an SCD method based on a recently introduced machine learning-based system and evaluate it on 15 corpora covering biomedical, clinical and newswire texts and ranging in the number of semantic categories from 2 to 91. With appropriate settings, our system maintains an average recall of 99% while reducing the number of candidate semantic categories on average by 65% over all data sets. Conclusions: Machine learning-based SCD using large lexical resources and approximate string matching is sensitive to the selection and granularity of lexical resources, but generalises well to a wide range of text domains and data sets given appropriate resources and parameter settings. By substantially reducing the number of candidate categories while only very rarely excluding the correct one, our method is shown to be applicable to manual annotation support tasks and use as a high-recall component in text processing pipelines.

We propose Subsemble: a general subset ensemble prediction method, which can be used for small, moderate, or large data sets. Subsemble partitions the full data set into subsets of observations, fits a specified underlying algorithm on each subset, and uses a clever form of V-fold cross-validation to output a prediction function that combines the subset-specific fits. We give an oracle result that provides a theoretical performance guarantee for Subsemble. Through simulations, we demonstrate that Subsemble can be a beneficial tool for small- to moderate-sized data sets, and often has better prediction performance than the underlying algorithm fit just once on the full data set. We also describe how to include Subsemble as a candidate in a SuperLearner library, providing a practical way to evaluate the performance of Subsemble relative to the underlying algorithm fit just once on the full data set.

Classification of Spent Reactor Fuel for Nuclear Forensics	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							URANIUM; SCIENCE	In this paper we demonstrate the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to determine the reactor type from which spent reactor fuel has originated. This has been done using the isotopic and elemental measurements of the sample and proves to be very useful in the field of nuclear forensics. Nuclear materials contain many variables (impurities and isotopes) that are very difficult to consider individually. A method that considers all material parameters simultaneously is advantageous. Currently the field of nuclear forensics focuses on the analysis of key material properties to determine details about the materials processing history, for example, utilizing known half-lives of isotopes can determine when the material was last processed (Stanley, F. E. J. Anal. At. Spectrom. 2012, 27, 1821; Varga, Z.; Wallenius, M.; Mayer, K.; Keegan, E.; Millet, S. Anal. Chem. 2009, 81, 8327-8334). However, it has been demonstrated that multivariate statistical analysis of isotopic concentrations can complement these method and are able to make use of a greater level of information through dimensionality reduction techniques (Robel, M.; Kristo, M. J. J. Environ. Radioact. 2008, 99, 1789-1797; Robel, M.; Kristo, M. J.; Heller, M. A. Nuclear Forensic Inferences Using Iterative Multidimensional Statistics. In Proceedings of the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management 50th Annual Meeting, Tucson, AZ, July 2009; 12 pages; Nicolaou, G. J. Environ. Radioact. 2006, 86, 313-318; Pajo, L.; Mayer, K.; Koch, L. Fresenius' J. Anal. Chem. 2001, 371, 348-352). There has been some success in using such multidimensional statistical methods to determine details about the history of spent reactor fuel (Robel, M.; Kristo, M. J. J. Environ. Radioact. 2008, 99, 1789-1797). Here, we aim to expand on these findings by pursuing more robust dimensionality reduction techniques based on manifold embedding which are able to better capture the intrinsic data set information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a number of classification algorithms to reliably determine the reactor type in which a spent fuel material has been irradiated. A number of these classification techniques are novel applications in nuclear forensics and expand on the existing knowledge in this field by creating a reliable and robust classification model. The results from this analysis show that our techniques have been very successful and further ascertain the excellent potential of these techniques in the field of nuclear forensics at least with regard to spent reactor fuel.

Automatic Detection of Regions in Spinach Canopies Responding to Soil Moisture Deficit Using Combined Visible and Thermal Imagery	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY; PLANT STRESS; WATER-STRESS; TEMPERATURE; GRAPEVINE; THERMOMETRY; CLOSURE	Thermal imaging has been used in the past for remote detection of regions of canopy showing symptoms of stress, including water deficit stress. Stress indices derived from thermal images have been used as an indicator of canopy water status, but these depend on the choice of reference surfaces and environmental conditions and can be confounded by variations in complex canopy structure. Therefore, in this work, instead of using stress indices, information from thermal and visible light imagery was combined along with machine learning techniques to identify regions of canopy showing a response to soil water deficit. Thermal and visible light images of a spinach canopy with different levels of soil moisture were captured. Statistical measurements from these images were extracted and used to classify between canopies growing in well-watered soil or under soil moisture deficit using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Processes Classifier (GPC) and a combination of both the classifiers. The classification results show a high correlation with soil moisture. We demonstrate that regions of a spinach crop responding to soil water deficit can be identified by using machine learning techniques with a high accuracy of 97%. This method could, in principle, be applied to any crop at a range of scales.

The ability to objectively identify individuals with chronic pain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is important for the advancement of diagnosis, treatment, and theoretical knowledge of brain processes associated with chronic pain. The purpose of our research is to investigate specific neurological markers that could be used to diagnose individuals experiencing chronic pain by using multivariate pattern analysis with fMRI data. We hypothesize that individuals with chronic pain have different patterns of brain activity in response to induced pain. This pattern can be used to classify the presence or absence of chronic pain. The fMRI experiment consisted of alternating 14 seconds of painful electric stimulation (applied to the lower back) with 14 seconds of rest. We analyzed contrast fMRI images in stimulation versus rest in pain-related brain regions to distinguish between the groups of participants: 1) chronic pain and 2) normal controls. We employed supervised machine learning techniques, specifically sparse logistic regression, to train a classifier based on these contrast images using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. We correctly classified 92.3% of the chronic pain group (N = 13) and 92.3% of the normal control group (N = 13) by recognizing multivariate patterns of activity in the somatosensory and inferior parietal cortex. This technique demonstrates that differences in the pattern of brain activity to induced pain can be used as a neurological marker to distinguish between individuals with and without chronic pain. Medical, legal and business professionals have recognized the importance of this research topic and of developing objective measures of chronic pain.

Hence, there is a great need for algorithms and software tools that could scale up to the whole omic level, integrate different omic data, leverage rich structure information, and be easily accessible to nontechnical users. We present GenAMap, an interactive analytics software platform that 1) automates the execution of principled machine learning methods that detect genome- and phenome-wide associations among genotypes, gene expression data, and clinical or other macroscopic traits, and 2) provides new visualization tools specifically designed to aid in the exploration of association mapping results. Algorithmically, GenAMap is based on a new paradigm for GWAS and PheWAS analysis, termed structured association mapping, which leverages various structures in the omic data. We demonstrate the function of GenAMap via a case study of the Brem and Kruglyak yeast dataset, and then apply it on a comprehensive eQTL analysis of the NIH heterogeneous stock mice dataset and report some interesting findings. GenAMap is available from http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/genamap.

Predicting Epileptic Seizures in Advance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ACCUMULATED ENERGY; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; REAL-TIME; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; RELIEFF	Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting 0.6-0.8% of the world's population. In this neurological disorder, abnormal activity of the brain causes seizures, the nature of which tend to be sudden. Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) are used as long-term therapeutic solutions that control the condition. Of those treated with AEDs, 35% become resistant to medication. The unpredictable nature of seizures poses risks for the individual with epilepsy. It is clearly desirable to find more effective ways of preventing seizures for such patients. The automatic detection of oncoming seizures, before their actual onset, can facilitate timely intervention and hence minimize these risks. In addition, advance prediction of seizures can enrich our understanding of the epileptic brain. In this study, drawing on the body of work behind automatic seizure detection and prediction from digitised Invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) data, a prediction algorithm, ASPPR (Advance Seizure Prediction via Pre-ictal Relabeling), is described. ASPPR facilitates the learning of predictive models targeted at recognizing patterns in EEG activity that are in a specific time window in advance of a seizure. It then exploits advanced machine learning coupled with the design and selection of appropriate features from EEG signals. Results, from evaluating ASPPR independently on 21 different patients, suggest that seizures for many patients can be predicted up to 20 minutes in advance of their onset. Compared to benchmark performance represented by a mean S1-Score (harmonic mean of Sensitivity and Specificity) of 90.6% for predicting seizure onset between 0 and 5 minutes in advance, ASPPR achieves mean S1-Scores of: 96.30% for prediction between 1 and 6 minutes in advance, 96.13% for prediction between 8 and 13 minutes in advance, 94.5% for prediction between 14 and 19 minutes in advance, and 94.2% for prediction between 20 and 25 minutes in advance.

J	Bai, L; Liang, JY				Bai, Liang; Liang, Jiye			The k-modes type clustering plus between-cluster information for categorical data	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Categorical data; The k-modes type algorithms; Optimization objective function; The between-cluster information	DISSIMILARITY MEASURE; ALGORITHM; VALUES; SETS	The k-modes algorithm and its modified versions are widely used to cluster categorical data. However, in the iterative process of these algorithms, the updating formulae, such as the partition matrix, cluster centers and attribute weights, are computed based on within-cluster information only. The between-cluster information is not considered, which maybe result in the clustering results with weak separation among different clusters. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new term which is used to reflect the separation. Furthermore, the new optimization objective functions are developed by adding the proposed term to the objective functions of several existing k-modes algorithms. Under the optimization framework, the corresponding updating formulae and convergence of the iterative process is strictly derived. The above improvements are used to enhance the effectiveness of these existing k-modes algorithms whilst keeping them simple. The experimental studies on real data sets from the UCI (University of California Irvine) Machine Learning Repository illustrate that these improved algorithms outperform their original counterparts in clustering categorical data sets and are also scalable to large data sets for their linear time complexity with respect to either the number of data objects, attributes or clusters.

J	Xue, H; Chen, SC				Xue, Hui; Chen, Songcan			Discriminality-driven regularization framework for indefinite kernel machine	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Discriminality-driven regularization; Indefinite kernel machine; Semi-supervised learning; Machine learning	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FEATURE SPACE; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; REPRESENTATION	Indefinite kernel machines have attracted more and more interests in machine learning due to their better empirical classification performance than the common positive definite kernel machines in many applications. A key to implement effective kernel machine is how to use prior knowledge as sufficiently as possible to guide the appropriate construction of the kernels. However, most of existing indefinite kernel machines actually utilize the knowledge involved in data such as discriminative and structural information insufficiently and thus construct the indefinite kernels empirically. Discriminatively regularized least-squares classification (DRLSC) is a recently-proposed supervised classification method which provides a new discriminality-driven regularizer to encourage the discriminality of the classifier rather than the common smoothness. In this paper, we rigorously validate that the discriminative regularizer actually coincides with the definition on the inner product in Reproducing Kernel Krein Space (RKKS) naturally. As a result, we further present a new discriminality-driven regularization framework for indefinite kernel machine based on the discriminative regularizer. According to the framework, we firstly reintroduce the original DRLSC from the viewpoint of the proper indefinite kernelization rather than the empirical kernel mapping. Then a novel semi-supervised algorithm is proposed in terms of different definition on the regularizer. The experiments on both toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the two algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(2012) [3]. The enhanced algorithm merges the virtue of point comparison of the Graham scan algorithm into the visual-attention-imitation convex hull algorithm. In comparison with its previous edition, the proposed algorithm achieved a significant time saving. In view of machine learning, there are interesting situations where training data acquisition must take place over time. An incremental learning version is also proposed in this paper in order to compute convex hulls of point sets whose points are acquired over time. The incremental learning version reuses the prior results and computes the new convex hull without processing of previous points. Experimental results show that the incremental learning version is more flexible and more efficient for incremental learning tasks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The determination of the relatedness between tasks is usually the key to the formulation of a multi-task learning method. In this paper, we make the assumption that when tasks are related to each other, usually their models are close enough, that is, their models or their model parameters are close to a certain mean function. Following this task relatedness assumption, two multi-task learning formulations based on one-class support vector machines (one-class SVM) are presented. With the help of new kernel design, both multi-task learning methods can be solved by the optimization program of a single one-class SVM. Experiments conducted on both low-dimensional nonlinear toy dataset and high-dimensional textured images show that our approaches lead to very encouraging results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of negative training set size on machine learning-based virtual screening	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; CHEMISTRY; TOOL	Background: The paper presents a thorough analysis of the influence of the number of negative training examples on the performance of machine learning methods. Results: The impact of this rather neglected aspect of machine learning methods application was examined for sets containing a fixed number of positive and a varying number of negative examples randomly selected from the ZINC database. An increase in the ratio of positive to negative training instances was found to greatly influence most of the investigated evaluating parameters of ML methods in simulated virtual screening experiments. In a majority of cases, substantial increases in precision and MCC were observed in conjunction with some decreases in hit recall. The analysis of dynamics of those variations let us recommend an optimal composition of training data. The study was performed on several protein targets, 5 machine learning algorithms (SMO, Naive Bayes, Ibk, J48 and Random Forest) and 2 types of molecular fingerprints (MACCS and CDK FP). The most effective classification was provided by the combination of CDK FP with SMO or Random Forest algorithms. The Naive Bayes models appeared to be hardly sensitive to changes in the number of negative instances in the training set. Conclusions: In conclusion, the ratio of positive to negative training instances should be taken into account during the preparation of machine learning experiments, as it might significantly influence the performance of particular classifier. What is more, the optimization of negative training set size can be applied as a boosting-like approach in machine learning-based virtual screening.

The transmission coefficients of disordered systems were computed to provide training and test data sets to the machine. The system's representation encodes energetic as well as geometrical information to characterize similarities between disordered configurations, while the Euclidean norm is used as a measure of similarity. Errors for out-of-sample predictions systematically decrease with training set size, enabling the accurate and fast prediction of new transmission coefficients. The remarkable performance of our model to capture the complexity of interference phenomena lends further support to its viability in dealing with transport problems of undulatory nature.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) adopts a unique diagnostic method, namely 'bian zheng lun zhi' or syndrome differentiation, to diagnose the CF with a set of syndrome factors, which can be regarded as the Multi-Label Learning (MLL) problem in the machine learning literature. To obtain an effective and reliable diagnostic tool, we use Conformal Predictor (CP), Random Forest (RF) and Problem Transformation method (PT) for the syndrome differentiation of CF. Methods and Materials: In this work, using PT method, CP-RF is extended to handle MLL problem. CP-RF applies RF to measure the confidence level (p-value) of each label being the true label, and then selects multiple labels whose p-values are larger than the pre-defined significance level as the region prediction. In this paper, we compare the proposed CP-RF with typical CP-NBC(Naive Bayes Classifier), CP-KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) and ML-KNN on CF dataset, which consists of 736 cases. Specifically, 95 symptoms are used to identify CF, and four syndrome factors are employed in the syndrome differentiation, including 'spleen deficiency', 'heart deficiency', 'liver stagnation' and 'qi deficiency'. The Results: CP-RF demonstrates an outstanding performance beyond CP-NBC, CP-KNN and ML-KNN under the general metrics of subset accuracy, hamming loss, one-error, coverage, ranking loss and average precision. Furthermore, the performance of CP-RF remains steady at the large scale of confidence levels from 80% to 100%, which indicates its robustness to the threshold determination. In addition, the confidence evaluation provided by CP is valid and wellcalibrated. Conclusion: CP-RF not only offers outstanding performance but also provides valid confidence evaluation for the CF syndrome differentiation. It would be well applicable to TCM practitioners and facilitate the utilities of objective, effective and reliable computer-based diagnosis tool.

Data from 127 children with ASD (13.5 +/- 6.0 years) and 153 age- and gender-matched typically developing children (14.5 +/- 5.7 years) were selected from the multi-center Functional Connectome Project. Regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness increased, whereas white matter volume decreased in ASD compared to controls. Small-world network analysis of quantitative MRI data demonstrated decreased global efficiency based on gray matter cortical thickness but not with functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) or volumetry. An integrative model of 22 quantitative imaging features was used for classification and prediction of phenotypic features that included the autism diagnostic observation schedule, the revised autism diagnostic interview, and intelligence quotient scores. Among the 22 imaging features, four (caudate volume, caudate-cortical functional connectivity and inferior frontal gyrus functional connectivity) were found to be highly informative, markedly improving classification and prediction accuracy when compared with the single imaging features. This approach could potentially serve as a biomarker in prognosis, diagnosis, and monitoring disease progression.

J	Booth, A; Gerding, E; McGroarty, F				Booth, Ash; Gerding, Enrico; McGroarty, Frank			Automated trading with performance weighted random forests and seasonality	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Random forests; Ensemble learning; Stock price prediction; Machine learning; Algorithmic trading	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; STOCK RETURNS; MARKET; PRICES; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; HOLIDAYS; RULES; INDEX	Seasonality effects and empirical regularities in financial data have been well documented in the financial economics literature for over seven decades. This paper proposes an expert system that uses novel machine learning techniques to predict the price return over these seasonal events, and then uses these predictions to develop a profitable trading strategy. While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, PF suffers from two long-standing problems that are referred to as sample degeneracy and impoverishment. We are investigating methods that are particularly efficient at Particle Distribution Optimization (PDO) to fight sample degeneracy and impoverishment, with an emphasis on intelligence choices. These methods benefit from such methods as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, Mean-shift algorithms, artificial intelligence algorithms (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization), machine learning approaches (e.g., clustering, splitting and merging) and their hybrids, forming a coherent standpoint to enhance the particle filter. The working mechanism, interrelationship, pros and cons of these approaches are provided. In addition, approaches that are effective for dealing with high-dimensionality are reviewed. While improving the filter performance in terms of accuracy, robustness and convergence, it is noted that advanced techniques employed in PF often causes additional computational requirement that will in turn sacrifice improvement obtained in real life filtering. This fact, hidden in pure simulations, deserves the attention of the users and designers of new filters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Forecasting energy consumption of multi-family residential buildings using support vector regression: Investigating the impact of temporal and spatial monitoring granularity on performance accuracy	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Forecasting; Machine learning; Monitoring; Prediction; Residential building; Support vector regression	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; OCCUPANT BEHAVIOR; PREDICTION; MACHINES; SYSTEM; LOAD	Buildings are the dominant source of energy consumption and environmental emissions in urban areas. Therefore, the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop ''sensor based'' approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly, 10 min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit) granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model. Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In addition to implications for the development of residential energy forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices. Ultimately, accurate and cost effective wide-scale energy prediction is a vital step towards next-generation energy efficiency initiatives, which will require not only consideration of the methods, but the scales for which data can be distilled into meaningful information.

J	Cohen, JP; Ding, W				Cohen, Joseph Paul; Ding, Wei			Crater detection via genetic search methods to reduce image features	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Shrinking feature set cardinality; Machine learning; Genetic algorithms; Crater detection; Bayesian classifier; Simulated annealing	RESOLUTION PLANETARY IMAGES; FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; SHAPE	Recent approaches to crater detection have been inspired by face detection's use of gray-scale texture features. Using gray-scale texture features for supervised machine learning crater detection algorithms provides better classification of craters in planetary images than previous methods. When using Haar features it is typical to generate thousands of numerical values from each candidate crater image. This magnitude of image features to extract and consider can spell disaster when the application is an entire planetary surface. One solution is to reduce the number of features extracted and considered in order to increase accuracy as well as speed. Feature subset selection provides the operational classifiers with a concise and denoised set of features by reducing irrelevant and redundant features. Feature subset selection is known to be NP-hard. To provide an efficient suboptimal solution, four genetic algorithms are proposed to use greedy selection, weighted random selection, and simulated annealing to distinguish discriminate features from indiscriminate features. Inspired by analysis regarding the relationship between subset size and accuracy, a squeezing algorithm is presented to shrink the genetic algorithm's chromosome cardinality during the genetic iterations. A significant increase in the classification performance of a Bayesian classifier in crater detection using image texture features is observed. (C) 2013 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a random sample of 800 campers who used Wisconsin state parks and forests in 2010, it confirms that calculated, normative, and social motivations are all important determinants of firewood movement rule compliance, a context where regulatees have primarily sporadic short-term interests, and where costs of compliance and noncompliance are both low. The study uses bi-variate statistical tests and recursive partitioning (standard and conditional permutation random forests) for analysis, and discusses findings from the perspective of a natural resources regulator of activities in multiple domains (e.g., business and recreational uses of forests in both rural and urban settings). It demonstrates how knowledge of motivations for compliance can inform two integrative research and analysis frameworks - motivational postures and social marketing, and discusses how affect and social norms may be utilized to improve regulator effectiveness.

Learning algorithms and the prediction models they generate are typically evaluated on the basis of cross-validation error estimates in a few exemplary datasets. However, in most applications, the ultimate goal of prediction modeling is to provide accurate predictions for independent samples obtained in different settings. Cross-validation within exemplary datasets may not adequately reflect performance in the broader application context. Methods: We develop and implement a systematic approach to 'cross-study validation', to replace or supplement conventional cross-validation when evaluating high-dimensional prediction models in independent datasets. We illustrate it via simulations and in a collection of eight estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer microarray gene-expression datasets, where the objective is predicting distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We computed the C-index for all pairwise combinations of training and validation datasets. We evaluate several alternatives for summarizing the pairwise validation statistics, and compare these to conventional cross-validation. Results: Our data-driven simulations and our application to survival prediction with eight breast cancer microarray datasets, suggest that standard cross-validation produces inflated discrimination accuracy for all algorithms considered, when compared to cross-study validation. Furthermore, the ranking of learning algorithms differs, suggesting that algorithms performing best in cross-validation may be suboptimal when evaluated through independent validation.

Various computational methods have been proposed for the identification of metabolites from tandem mass spectra. Fragmentation tree methods explore the space of possible ways in which the metabolite can fragment, and base the metabolite identification on scoring of these fragmentation trees. Machine learning methods have been used to map mass spectra to molecular fingerprints; predicted fingerprints, in turn, can be used to score candidate molecular structures. Results: Here, we combine fragmentation tree computations with kernel-based machine learning to predict molecular fingerprints and identify molecular structures. We introduce a family of kernels capturing the similarity of fragmentation trees, and combine these kernels using recently proposed multiple kernel learning approaches. Experiments on two large reference datasets show that the new methods significantly improve molecular fingerprint prediction accuracy. These improvements result in better metabolite identification, doubling the number of metabolites ranked at the top position of the candidates list.

It seeks to give a representative picture of the research topics most explored in recent years, highlight common themes in the investigations of independent research teams and highlight the contributions of rising as well as established researchers both to the theory of robust optimization and its practice. With respect to the theory of robust optimization, this paper reviews recent results on the cases without and with recourse, i.e., the static and dynamic settings, as well as the connection with stochastic optimization and risk theory, the concept of distributionally robust optimization, and findings in robust nonlinear optimization. With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., "robustifying" stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good.

Machine learning classification of resting state functional connectivity predicts smoking status	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						biomarkers; fMRI; machine learning; nicotine addiction; support vector machines	DRUG-ADDICTION; BRAIN NETWORKS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; FMRI; NICOTINE; DISEASE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; IMPULSIVITY; DYSFUNCTION; ACTIVATION	Machine learning-based approaches are now able to examine functional magnetic resonance imaging data in a multivariate manner and extract features predictive of group membership. We applied support vector machine (SVM)-based classification to resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) data from nicotine-dependent smokers and healthy controls to identify brain-based features predictive of nicotine dependence. By employing a network-centered approach, we observed that within-network functional connectivity measures offered maximal information for predicting smoking status, as opposed to between-network connectivity, or the representativeness of each individual node with respect to its parent network. Further, our analysis suggests that connectivity measures within the executive control and frontoparietal networks are particularly informative in predicting smoking status. Our findings suggest that machine learning-based approaches to classifying rsFC data offer a valuable alternative technique to understanding large-scale differences in addiction-related neurobiology.

J	Wilhelm, T				Wilhelm, Thomas			Phenotype prediction based on genome-wide DNA methylation data	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Epigenetics; DNA methylation; Cancer; Feature selection; Machine learning; Classifier	TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GENES; EPIGENETIC CHANGES; OVARIAN-CANCER; STEM-CELLS; EXPRESSION; EPIGENOME; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSFORMATION; HERITABILITY; VARIABILITY	Background: DNA methylation (DNAm) has important regulatory roles in many biological processes and diseases. It is the only epigenetic mark with a clear mechanism of mitotic inheritance and the only one easily available on a genome scale. Aberrant cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation has been discussed in the context of disease aetiology, especially cancer. CpG hypermethylation of promoter regions is often associated with silencing of tumour suppressor genes and hypomethylation with activation of oncogenes. Supervised principal component analysis (SPCA) is a popular machine learning method. However, in a recent application to phenotype prediction from DNAm data SPCA was inferior to the specific method EVORA. Results: We present Model-Selection-SPCA (MS-SPCA), an enhanced version of SPCA. MS-SPCA applies several models that perform well in the training data to the test data and selects the very best models for final prediction based on parameters of the test data. We have applied MS-SPCA for phenotype prediction from genome-wide DNAm data. CpGs used for prediction are selected based on the quantification of three features of their methylation (average methylation difference, methylation variation difference and methylation-age-correlation). We analysed four independent case-control datasets that correspond to different stages of cervical cancer: (i) cases currently cytologically normal, but will later develop neoplastic transformations, (ii, iii) cases showing neoplastic transformations and (iv) cases with confirmed cancer. The first dataset was split into several smaller case-control datasets (samples either Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) positive or negative). We demonstrate that cytology normal HPV+ and HPV- samples contain DNAm patterns which are associated with later neoplastic transformations. We present evidence that DNAm patterns exist in cytology normal HPV- samples that (i) predispose to neoplastic transformations after HPV infection and (ii) predispose to HPV infection itself. MS-SPCA performs significantly better than EVORA. Conclusions: MS-SPCA can be applied to many classification problems. Additional improvements could include usage of more than one principal component (PC), with automatic selection of the optimal number of PCs. We expect that MS-SPCA will be useful for analysing recent larger DNAm data to predict future neoplastic transformations.

Efficient design of meganucleases using a machine learning approach	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ZINC-FINGER NUCLEASES; HOMING ENDONUCLEASE; I-CREI; CLEAVAGE SPECIFICITY; TARGET SITE; DNA-BINDING; REGULATORY NETWORKS; GENE-THERAPY; CONTEXT; CLASSIFICATION	Background: Meganucleases are important tools for genome engineering, providing an efficient way to generate DNA double-strand breaks at specific loci of interest. Numerous experimental efforts, ranging from in vivo selection to in silico modeling, have been made to re-engineer meganucleases to target relevant DNA sequences. Results: Here we present a novel in silico method for designing custom meganucleases that is based on the use of a machine learning approach. We compared it with existing in silico physical models and high-throughput experimental screening. The machine learning model was used to successfully predict active meganucleases for 53 new DNA targets. Conclusions: This new method shows competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art in silico physical models, with up to a fourfold increase in terms of the design success rate. Compared to experimental high-throughput screening methods, it reduces the number of screening experiments needed by a factor of more than 100 without affecting final performance.

Decision-makers need to know which of the remaining forests to prioritize for conservation, but the only spatial information on forest biodiversity has, until recently, come from a sparse network of ground-based plots. Here we explore whether airborne hyperspectral imagery can be used to predict the alpha diversity of upper canopy trees in a West African forest. The abundance of tree species were collected from 64 plots (each 1250 m(2) in size) within a Sierra Leonean national park, and Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated. An airborne spectrometer measured reflectances of 186 bands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range at 1 m(2) resolution. The standard deviations of these reflectance values and their first-order derivatives were calculated for each plot from the c. 1250 pixels of hyperspectral information within them. Shannon-Wiener indices were then predicted from these plot-based reflectance statistics using a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The regression model fitted the data well (pseudo-R-2 = 84.9%), and we show that standard deviations of green-band reflectances and infra-red region derivatives had the strongest explanatory powers. Our work shows that airborne hyperspectral sensing can be very effective at mapping canopy tree diversity, because its high spatial resolution allows within-plot heterogeneity in reflectance to be characterized, making it an effective tool for monitoring forest biodiversity over large geographic scales.

Most of discretization methods mainly concentrate on discretizing low-dimensional data. In this paper, we focus on discretizing high-dimensional data that frequently present the nonlinear structures. Firstly, we present a novel supervised dimension reduction algorithm to map high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space, which ensures to keep intrinsic correlation structure of the original data. This algorithm overcomes the deficiency that the geometric topology of the data is easily distorted when mapping data that present an uneven distribution in high-dimensional space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data discretization with a dimension reduction technique. Secondly, we propose a supervised area-based chi-square discretization algorithm to effectively discretize each continuous dimension in the low-dimensional space. This algorithm overcomes the deficiency that existing methods do not consider the possibility of being merged for each interval pair from the view of probability. Finally, we conduct the experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method achieves higher classification accuracy and yields a more concise knowledge of the data especially for high-dimensional datasets than existing discretization methods. In addition, our discretization method has also been successfully applied to computer vision and image classification. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The solution of KMSE is typically not sparse, which may be harmful for real time applications. Current proposed algorithms show hindrances when dealing with sample flow learning systems. A significant improvement utilizes incremental learning, namely IKMSE, to achieve better sparsity however it is not enough. We propose two additional adaptive incremental learning algorithms, viz. CRKMSE and PRKMSE. CRKMSE adopts a complete reduction strategy while PRKMSE uses the partial reduction. Generally, PRKMSE is superior to CRKMSE in terms of training time. And PRKMSE owns a better real time than CRKMSE in the testing phase due to fewer significant nodes. Finally, a lot of experiments are reported to confirm our viewpoints in this paper.

Identification of host-microbe interaction factors in the genomes of soft rot-associated pathogens Dickeya dadantii 3937 and Pectobacterium carotovorum WPP14 with supervised machine learning	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Data mining; Plant pathogen; Genome scale analysis; Enterobacteria	BACTERIUM ERWINIA-CHRYSANTHEMI; PROTEIN SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; HORIZONTAL GENE-TRANSFER; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; SUBSP CAROTOVORA; CODON USAGE; PHYSICOCHEMICAL FEATURES; FEATURE-SELECTION	Background: A wealth of genome sequences has provided thousands of genes of unknown function, but identification of functions for the large numbers of hypothetical genes in phytopathogens remains a challenge that impacts all research on plant-microbe interactions. Decades of research on the molecular basis of pathogenesis focused on a limited number of factors associated with long-known host-microbe interaction systems, providing limited direction into this challenge. Computational approaches to identify virulence genes often rely on two strategies: searching for sequence similarity to known host-microbe interaction factors from other organisms, and identifying islands of genes that discriminate between pathogens of one type and closely related non-pathogens or pathogens of a different type. The former is limited to known genes, excluding vast collections of genes of unknown function found in every genome. The latter lacks specificity, since many genes in genomic islands have little to do with host-interaction. Result: In this study, we developed a supervised machine learning approach that was designed to recognize patterns from large and disparate data types, in order to identify candidate host-microbe interaction factors. The soft rot Enterobacteriaceae strains Dickeya dadantii 3937 and Pectobacterium carotovorum WPP14 were used for development of this tool, because these pathogens are important on multiple high value crops in agriculture worldwide and more genomic and functional data is available for the Enterobacteriaceae than any other microbial family. Our approach achieved greater than 90% precision and a recall rate over 80% in 10-fold cross validation tests. Conclusion: Application of the learning scheme to the complete genome of these two organisms generated a list of roughly 200 candidates, many of which were previously not implicated in plant-microbe interaction and many of which are of completely unknown function. These lists provide new targets for experimental validation and further characterization, and our approach presents a promising pattern-learning scheme that can be generalized to create a resource to study host-microbe interactions in other bacterial phytopathogens.

J	Murakami, Y; Mizuguchi, K				Murakami, Yoichi; Mizuguchi, Kenji			Homology-based prediction of interactions between proteins using Averaged One-Dependence Estimators	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Prediction of protein-protein interactions; Homology; Machine learning; Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)	SHORT POLYPEPTIDE SEQUENCES; INTERACTION NETWORKS; NAIVE BAYES; DOMAIN; TOOL; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; INTEROLOGS; INFERENCE	Background: Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for a better understanding of biological processes, pathways and functions. However, experimental identification of the complete set of PPIs in a cell/organism ("an interactome") is still a difficult task. To circumvent limitations of current high-throughput experimental techniques, it is necessary to develop high-performance computational methods for predicting PPIs. Results: In this article, we propose a new computational method to predict interaction between a given pair of protein sequences using features derived from known homologous PPIs. The proposed method is capable of predicting interaction between two proteins (of unknown structure) using Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE) and three features calculated for the protein pair: (a) sequence similarities to a known interacting protein pair (F-Seq), (b) statistical propensities of domain pairs observed in interacting proteins (F-Dom) and (c) a sum of edge weights along the shortest path between homologous proteins in a PPI network (F-Net). Feature vectors were defined to lie in a half-space of the symmetrical high-dimensional feature space to make them independent of the protein order. The predictability of the method was assessed by a 10-fold cross validation on a recently created human PPI dataset with randomly sampled negative data, and the best model achieved an Area Under the Curve of 0.79 (pAUC(0.5%) = 0.16). In addition, the AODE trained on all three features (named PSOPIA) showed better prediction performance on a separate independent data set than a recently reported homology-based method. Conclusions: Our results suggest that FNet, a feature representing proximity in a known PPI network between two proteins that are homologous to a target protein pair, contributes to the prediction of whether the target proteins interact or not. PSOPIA will help identify novel PPIs and estimate complete PPI networks. The method proposed in this article is freely available on the web at http://mizuguchilab. org/PSOPIA.

In particular we focus our attention on two major interface types, namely protein-ligand and protein-peptide interfaces. As concerns protein-ligand binding site prediction, we classify the most interesting methods and approaches into four main categories: (a) shape-based methods, (b) alignment-based methods, (c) graph-theoretic approaches and (d) machine learning methods. Class (a) encompasses those methods which employ, in some way, geometric information about the protein surface. Methods falling into class (b) address the prediction problem as an alignment problem, i.e. finding protein-ligand atom pairs that occupy spatially equivalent positions. Graph theoretic approaches, class (c), are mainly based on the definition of a particular graph, known as the protein contact graph, and then apply some sophisticated methods from graph theory to discover subgraphs or score similarities for uncovering functional sites. The last class (d) contains those methods that are based on the learn-from-examples paradigm and that are able to take advantage of the large amount of data available on known protein-ligand pairs. As for protein-peptide interfaces, due to the often disordered nature of the regions involved in binding, shape similarity is no longer a determining factor. Then, in geometry-based methods, geometry is accounted for by providing the relative position of the atoms surrounding the peptide residues in known structures. Finally, also for protein-peptide interfaces, we present a classification of some successful machine learning methods. Indeed, they can be categorized in the way adopted to construct the learning examples. In particular, we envisage three main methods: distance functions, structure and potentials and structure alignment.

As a first step towards the high-throughput diagnosis of ultra-rare developmental diseases we introduce an automatic approach that implements recent developments in computer vision. This algorithm extracts phenotypic information from ordinary non-clinical photographs and, using machine learning, models human facial dysmorphisms in a multidimensional 'Clinical Face Phenotype Space'. The space locates patients in the context of known syndromes and thereby facilitates the generation of diagnostic hypotheses. Consequently, the approach will aid clinicians by greatly narrowing (by 27.6-fold) the search space of potential diagnoses for patients with suspected developmental disorders. Furthermore, this Clinical Face Phenotype Space allows the clustering of patients by phenotype even when no known syndrome diagnosis exists, thereby aiding disease identification. We demonstrate that this approach provides a novel method for inferring causative genetic variants from clinical sequencing data through functional genetic pathway comparisons.

J	Zhang, Z; Zhang, YN				Zhang, Zhen; Zhang, Yanning			Variable kernel density estimation based robust regression and its applications	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Robust regression; Kernel density estimation; Variable bandwidth	MLESAC	Robust estimation with high break down point is an important and fundamental topic in computer vision, machine learning and many other areas. Traditional robust estimator with a break down point more than 50%, for illustration, Random Sampling Consensus and its derivatives, needs a user specified scale of inliers such that inliers can be distinguished from outliers, but in many applications, we do not have any a priori of the scale of inliers, so an empirical value is usually specified. In recent years, a group of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based robust estimators has been proposed to solve this problem. However, as the most important parameter, bandwidth, for KDE is highly correlated to the scale of inliers, these methods turned out to be a scale estimator for inliers, and it is not an easy work to estimate the scale of inliers. Thus, the authors build up a robust estimator based on Variable Kernel Density Estimation (VKDE). Compared to KDE, VKDE estimates bandwidth out of local information of samples by using K-Nearest-Neighbor method instead of estimating bandwidth from the scale of inliers. Thus the estimation for the scale of inliers can be omitted. Furthermore, as variable bandwidth technique is applied, the proposed method uses smaller bandwidths for the areas where samples are more densely distributed. As inliers are much more densely distributed than outliers, the proposed method achieved a higher resolution for inliers, and then the peak of estimated density will be closer to the point near which samples are most densely distributed. At last, the proposed method is compared to two most widely used robust estimators, Random Sampling Consensus and Least Median Square. From the result we can see that it has higher precision than those two methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A novel evolving spiking neural network reservoir system (eSNNr) is proposed for the purpose. The system consists of spike-time encoding module of continuous value input information into spike trains; a recurrent 3D SNNr; eSNN as an evolving output classifier. Such system is generated for every new individual, using existing data of similar individuals. Subject to proper training and parameter optimisation, the system is capable of accurate spatio-temporal pattern recognition (STPR) and of early prediction of individual events. The method and the system are generic, applicable to various SSTD and classification and prediction problems. As a case study, the method is applied for early prediction of occurrence of stroke on an individual basis. Preliminary experiments demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy and time of event prediction when using the proposed method when compared with standard machine learning methods, such as MLR, SVM, and MLR Future development and applications are discussed.

It is inspired by data-driven and inference-based methods in machine learning. First, the three-dimensional characteristics of LiDAR data are considered in our algorithm. We design an adaptive morphological filter to classify the data into two classes, ground points and nonground points. Second, the elevation feature is used to extract the river. In this way, the search space can be greatly reduced. Third, the river is represented as a skeleton line by the morphological thinning algorithm. This concise representation makes the proposed approach more efficient to detect bridges. Finally, we propose the shortest distance rule based on the skeleton line. The fusion of the classification map and the rule is used to detect bridges. The flexibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments on several different scenes. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has good performance in detecting a bridge over water.

A neurochennical closed-loop controller for deep brain stimulation: toward individualized smart neuromodulation therapies	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep brain stimulation (DBS); feedback control systems; local field potentials (LFP); fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV); machine learning; individualized medicine	SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS STIMULATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; PILOCARPINE-INDUCED SEIZURES; ADVANCED PARKINSON-DISEASE; SCAN CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; LONG-TERM EFFICACY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION	Current strategies for optimizing deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy involve multiple postoperative visits. During each visit, stimulation parameters are adjusted until desired therapeutic effects are achieved and adverse effects are minimized. However, the efficacy of these therapeutic parameters may decline with time due at least in part to disease progression, interactions between the host environment and the electrode, and lead migration. As such, development of closed-loop control systems that can respond to changing neurochemical environments, tailoring DBS therapy to individual patients, is paramount for improving the therapeutic efficacy of DBS. Evidence obtained using electrophysiology and imaging techniques in both animals and humans suggests that DBS works by modulating neural network activity. Recently, animal studies have shown that stimulation-evoked changes in neurotransmitter release that mirror normal physiology are associated with the therapeutic benefits of DBS. Therefore, to fully understand the neurophysiology of DBS and optimize its efficacy, it may be necessary to look beyond conventional electrophysiological analyses and characterize the neurochemical effects of therapeutic and non-therapeutic stimulation. By combining electrochemical monitoring and mathematical modeling techniques, we can potentially replace the trial-and-error process used in clinical programming with deterministic approaches that help attain optimal and stable neurochemical profiles. In this manuscript, we summarize the current understanding of electrophysiological and electrochemical processing for control of neuromodulation therapies. Additionally, we describe a proof-of-principle closed-loop controller that characterizes DBS-evoked dopamine changes to adjust stimulation parameters in a rodent model of DBS. The work described herein represents the initial steps toward achieving a "smart" neuroprosthetic system for treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

The automated analysis of pulmonary acoustic signals can serve as a differential diagnosis tool for medical professionals, a learning tool for medical students, and a self-management tool for patients. In this context, we intend to evaluate and compare the performance of the support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbour (K-nn) classifiers in diagnosis respiratory pathologies using respiratory sounds from R.A.L.E database. Results: The pulmonary acoustic signals used in this study were obtained from the R.A.L.E lung sound database. The pulmonary acoustic signals were manually categorised into three different groups, namely normal, airway obstruction pathology, and parenchymal pathology. The mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features were extracted from the pre-processed pulmonary acoustic signals. The MFCC features were analysed by one-way ANOVA and then fed separately into the SVM and K-nn classifiers. The performances of the classifiers were analysed using the confusion matrix technique. The statistical analysis of the MFCC features using one-way ANOVA showed that the extracted MFCC features are significantly different (p < 0.001). The classification accuracies of the SVM and K-nn classifiers were found to be 92.19% and 98.26%, respectively. Conclusion: Although the data used to train and test the classifiers are limited, the classification accuracies found are satisfactory. The K-nn classifier was better than the SVM classifier for the discrimination of pulmonary acoustic signals from pathological and normal subjects obtained from the RALE database.

Because next-generation sequencing generates high-throughput data that allow us to detect genes, it is important to identify genes that drive functional and phenotypic changes of cells. However, conventional methods rely heavily on the assumption of normality and they often give incorrect results when the assumption is not true. To relax the Gaussian assumption in causal inference, we introduce the non-paranormal method to test conditional independence in the PC-algorithm. Then, we present the non-paranormal intervention-calculus when the directed acyclic graph (DAG) is absent (NPN-IDA), which incorporates the cumulative nature of effects through a cascaded pathway via causal inference for ranking causal genes against a phenotype with the non-paranormal method for estimating DAGs. Results: We demonstrate that causal inference with the non-paranormal method significantly improves the performance in estimating DAGs on synthetic data in comparison with the original PC-algorithm. Moreover, we show that NPN-IDA outperforms the conventional methods in exploring regulators of the flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana and regulators that control the browning of white adipocytes in mice. Our results show that performance improvement in estimating DAGs contributes to an accurate estimation of causal effects. Conclusions: Although the simplest alternative procedure was used, our proposed method enables us to design efficient intervention experiments and can be applied to a wide range of research purposes, including drug discovery, because of its generality.

Among these methods, a very popular type is semi-supervised support vector machines. However, parameter selection in heat kernel function during the learning process is troublesome and harms the performance improvement of the hypothesis. To solve this problem, a novel local behavioral searching strategy is proposed for semi-supervised learning in this paper. In detail, based on human behavioral learning theory, the support vector machine is regularized with the un-normalized graph Laplacian. After building local distribution of feature space, local behavioral paradigm considers the form of the underlying probability distribution in the neighborhood of a point. Validation of the proposed method is performed with extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that compared with traditional method, our method can more effectively and stably enhance the learning performance.

Part II-Multiple Echo Processing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Biosonar; fusion of estimates; sonar; threshold effect; time-of-flight (ToF) estimation	WIDE-BAND BIOSONAR; SONAR; ACCURACY; MODEL	The mean squared error of the classical maximum likelihood time-of-flight (ToF) estimator increases dramatically when the signal-to-noise ratio falls below a certain threshold. For narrow-band signals, this well-known threshold effect occurs largely due to the biased outliers which are induced by the local maxima of the source signal autocorrelation function. In our previous work (Part I), we have described a machine learning biosonar-inspired method for reducing the effect of the outlier bias on the accuracy of a single-echo estimate. In this paper, we extend this approach by introducing a method for combining multiple echo signals into a robust ToF estimator which is resilient to outliers. The individual bias-corrected estimates are combined together using the optimal weighted averaging (OWA) scheme which takes into account the uncertainties associated with inlier and outlier measurements. As in the single-echo case, a weak classifier and a bank of phase-shifted unmatched filters are used for estimating the probabilities of appearance of a specific outlier class in a single-echo estimate. Combined with the previously introduced single-echo bias-reduction method, the OWA scheme results in significant improvement in the ToF estimation accuracy.

ANA HEp-2 cells image classification using number, size, shape and localization of targeted cell regions	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Immunofluorescent images; HEp-2 cells; Antinuclear antibodies; Image classification	AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASE; IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE; AUTOANTIBODIES	The ANA HEp-2 medical test is a powerful tool in autoimmune disease diagnostics. The last step of this test, the interpretation of immunofluorescent images by trained experts, represents a potential source of errors and could theoretically be replaced by automated methods. Here we present a fully automatic method for recognition of types of immunofluorescent images produced by the ANA HEp-2 medical test. The proposed method makes use of the difference in number, size, shape and localization of cell regions that are targeted by the antinuclear antibodies - the humoral components of immune system that bind human antigens as a result of the immune system malfunction. The method extracts morphological properties of stained cell regions using a combination of thresholding-based and thresholding-less approaches and applies a conventional machine-learning algorithm for image classification.

A framework for cost-based feature selection	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Cost-based feature selection; Machine learning; Filter methods	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION	Over the last few years, the dimensionality of datasets involved in data mining applications has increased dramatically. In this situation, feature selection becomes indispensable as it allows for dimensionality reduction and relevance detection. The research proposed in this paper broadens the scope of feature selection by taking into consideration not only the relevance of the features but also their associated costs. A new general framework is proposed, which consists of adding a new term to the evaluation function of a filter feature selection method so that the cost is taken into account. Although the proposed methodology could be applied to any feature selection filter, in this paper the approach is applied to two representative filter methods: Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) and Minimal-Redundancy-Maximal-Relevance (mRMR), as an example of use. The behavior of the proposed framework is tested on 17 heterogeneous classification datasets, employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. The results of the experimental study show that the approach is sound and that it allows the user to reduce the cost without compromising the classification error. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, CH				Chen, Chien-Hsing			A hybrid intelligent model of analyzing clinical breast cancer data using clustering techniques with feature selection	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Breast cancer diagnoses; Feature selection; Cluster analysis; Filter model; Wrapper model	MUTUAL INFORMATION; SEPARATION; DIAGNOSIS	Models based on data mining and machine learning techniques have been developed to detect the disease early or assist in clinical breast cancer diagnoses. Feature selection is commonly applied to improve the performance of models. There are numerous studies on feature selection in the literature, and most of the studies focus on feature selection in supervised learning. When class labels are absent, feature selection methods in unsupervised learning are required. However, there are few studies on these methods in the literature. Our paper aims to present a hybrid intelligence model that uses the cluster analysis techniques with feature selection for analyzing clinical breast cancer diagnoses. Our model provides an option of selecting a subset of salient features for performing clustering and comprehensively considers the use of most existing models that use all the features to perform clustering. In particular, we study the methods by selecting salient features to identify clusters using a comparison of coincident quantitative measurements. When applied to benchmark breast cancer datasets, experimental results indicate that our method outperforms several benchmark filter- and wrapper-based methods in selecting features used to discover natural clusters, maximizing the between-cluster scatter and minimizing the within-cluster scatter toward a satisfactory clustering quality.

J	Han, XX				Han, Xiaoxu			Implicit feature selection for omics data phenotype discrimination	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Omics; Feature selection; Wavelet; Classification; Biomarker	MOLECULAR-PATTERN DISCOVERY; MATRIX FACTORIZATION; TUMOR CLASSIFICATION; BIOMARKER DISCOVERY; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PROFILES; NETWORKS	A novel feature selection method: meta-data approximation (MDA) is proposed for high dimensional omics data. Different from conventional approaches, MDA is an implicit feature selection algorithm that does not have an explicit feature number decrease or dimension reduction for input data. On the other hand, MDA calculates corresponding same dimensional meta-data to approximate original data through our proposed hierarchical feature decomposition. We demonstrate MDA's advantages in disease phenotype discrimination for different high dimensional omics profiles by comparing it with state-of-the-arts. Our results suggest that high dimensional omics data are actually linearly separable under meta-data approximation. Finally, a MDA-induced biomarker discovery algorithm is proposed to further demonstrate omics data' linear separability by identifying meaningful biomarkers. Our work not only suggests a new alternative to overcome the weaknesses of the traditional feature selection methods, but also provides new techniques and insights in translational bioinformatics. To the best of our knowledge, we firstly proposed the concept and method of implicit feature selection, which will also have positive impacts on machine learning fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier BY.

We approach the IQA field by focusing on a classification problem that maps different objective metrics into different categorical quality classes. To this end, we adopt a machine learning classification approach, where No Reference (NR) metrics are considered as features, while the assigned classes come from psycho-visual experiments. Eleven NR metrics have been considered: seven specific for blockiness and four general purpose. We evaluate the performance of single metrics and investigate if a pool of metrics can reach better performances than each of the single ones. Five as well as three quality classes are considered, and the corresponding classifiers are tested on two well known databases available in the literature (LIVE and MICT), and on a new database (IVL) presented in this paper.

J	Zhou, Y; Fenton, N; Neil, M				Zhou, Yun; Fenton, Norman; Neil, Martin			Bayesian network approach to multinomial parameter learning using data and expert judgments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Bayesian networks; Multinomial parameter learning; Expert judgments	CONSTRAINTS; PROBABILITIES; INFERENCE	One of the hardest challenges in building a realistic Bayesian Network (BN) model is to construct the node probability tables (NPTs). Even with a fixed predefined model structure and very large amounts of relevant data, machine learning methods do not consistently achieve great accuracy compared to the ground truth when learning the NPT entries (parameters). Hence, it is widely believed that incorporating expert judgments can improve the learning process. We present a multinomial parameter learning method, which can easily incorporate both expert judgments and data during the parameter learning process. This method uses an auxiliary BN model to learn the parameters of a given BN. The auxiliary BN contains continuous variables and the parameter estimation amounts to updating these variables using an iterative discretization technique. The expert judgments are provided in the form of constraints on parameters divided into two categories: linear inequality constraints and approximate equality constraints. The method is evaluated with experiments based on a number of well-known sample BN models (such as Asia, Alarm and Hailfinder) as well as a real-world software defects prediction BN model. Empirically, the new method achieves much greater learning accuracy (compared to both state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and directly competing methods) with much less data. For example, in the software defects BN for a sample size of 20 (which would be considered difficult to collect in practice) when a small number of real expert constraints are provided, our method achieves a level of accuracy in parameter estimation that can only be matched by other methods with much larger sample sizes (320 samples required for the standard machine learning method, and 105 for the directly competing method with constraints).

J	Galgani, F; Compton, P; Hoffmann, A				Galgani, Filippo; Compton, Paul; Hoffmann, Achim			HAUSS: Incrementally building a summarizer combining multiple techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Knowledge acquisition; Natural language processing; Automatic summarization; Legal documents	INFORMATION EXTRACTION SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; CLASSIFICATION; DOCUMENTS	The idea of automatic summarization dates back to 1958, when Luhn invented the "auto abstract" (Luhn, 1958). Since then, many diverse automatic summarization approaches have been proposed, but no single technique has solved the increasingly urgent need for automatic summarization. Rather than proposing one more such technique, we suggest that the best solution is likely a system able to combine multiple summarization techniques, as required by the type of documents being summarized. Thus, this paper presents HAUSS: a framework to quickly build specialized summarizers, integrating several base techniques into a single approach. To recognize relevant text fragments, rules are created that combine frequency, centrality, citation and linguistic information in a context-dependent way. An incremental knowledge acquisition framework strongly supports the creation of these rules, using a training corpus to guide rule acquisition, and produce a powerful knowledge base specific to the domain. Using HAUSS, we created a knowledge base for catchphrase extraction in legal text. The system outperforms existing state-of-the-art general-purpose summarizers and machine learning approaches. Legal experts rated the extracted summaries similar to the original catchphrases given by the court. Our investigation of knowledge acquisition methods for summarization therefore demonstrates that it is possible to quickly create effective special-purpose summarizers, which combine multiple techniques, into a single context-aware approach.

Among others, the number of retweets (RTs) and user types are the two important items of analysis for understanding the transmission of information on Twitter. To analyze this point, we applied text classification and feature extraction experiments using random forests machine learning with conventional stylistic and Twitter-specific features. We first collected tweets from 40 accounts with a high number of followers and created tweet texts from 28,756 tweets. We then conducted 15 types of classification experiments using a variety of combinations of features such as function words, speech terms, Twitter's descriptive grammar, and information roles. We deliberately observed the effects of features for classification performance. The results indicated that class classification per user indicated the best performance. Furthermore, we observed that certain features had a greater impact on classification. In the case of the experiments that assessed the level of RT quantity, information roles had an impact. In the case of user experiments, important features, such as the honorific postpositional particle and auxiliary verbs, such as "desu" and "masu," had an impact. This research clarifies the features that are useful for categorizing tweets according to the number of RTs and user types.

J	Cowen, AS; Chun, MM; Kuhl, BA				Cowen, Alan S.; Chun, Marvin M.; Kuhl, Brice A.			Neural portraits of perception: Reconstructing face images from evoked brain activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; TEMPORAL CORTEX; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; FACIAL IDENTITY; REPRESENTATIONS; NETWORK; AREA; REACTIVATION; ADAPTATION	Recent neuroimaging advances have allowed visual experience to be reconstructed from patterns of brain activity. While neural reconstructions have ranged in complexity, they have relied almost exclusively on retinotopic mappings between visual input and activity in early visual cortex. However, subjective perceptual information is tied more closely to higher-level cortical regions that have not yet been used as the primary basis for neural reconstructions. Furthermore, no reconstruction studies to date have reported reconstructions of face images, which activate a highly distributed cortical network. Thus, we investigated (a) whether individual face images could be accurately reconstructed from distributed patterns of neural activity, and (b) whether this could be achieved even when excluding activity within occipital cortex. Our approach involved four steps. (1) Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify components that efficiently represented a set of training faces. (2) The identified components were then mapped, using a machine learning algorithm, to fMRI activity collected during viewing of the training faces. (3) Based on activity elicited by a new set of test faces, the algorithm predicted associated component scores. (4) Finally, these scores were transformed into reconstructed images. Using both objective and subjective validation measures, we show that our methods yield strikingly accurate neural reconstructions of faces even when excluding occipital cortex. This methodology not only represents a novel and promising approach for investigating face perception, but also suggests avenues for reconstructing 'offline' visual experiences including dreams, memories, and imagination which are chiefly represented in higher-level cortical areas.

Ensemble forecasting with machine learning algorithms for ozone, nitrogen dioxide and PM10 on the Prev'Air platform	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Operational forecasting; Ensemble forecast; Sequential aggregation; Chemical transport models; Ozone; Nitrogen dioxide; Particulate matter; Threshold exceedance	CHEMICAL-TRANSPORT MODEL; GASEOUS DRY DEPOSITION; AIR-QUALITY MODELS; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; POLYPHEMUS SYSTEM; WESTERN-EUROPE; REGIONAL-SCALE; TO-DATA; AEROSOLS	This paper presents the application of an ensemble forecasting approach to the Prev'Air operational platform. This platform aims at forecasting maps, on a daily basis, for ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. It relies on several air quality models which differ by their physical parameterizations, their input data and numerical strategies, so that one model may perform better with respect to observations for a given pollutant, at a given time and location. We apply sequential aggregation methods to this ensemble of models, which has already proved good potential in previous research papers. Compared to these studies, the novelties of this paper are the variety of models, the real operational context, which requires robustness assessment, and the application to several pollutants. In this paper, we first introduce the ensemble forecasting methods and the operational platform Prev'Air along with its models. Then, the sequential aggregation performance and robustness are assessed using two different data sets. The results with the discounted ridge regression method show that the errors of the forecasts are respectively reduced by at least 29%, 35% and 19% for hourly, daily and peak O-3 concentrations, by 19%, 26% and 20% for hourly, daily and peak NO2 concentrations, and finally by 17%, 19% and 11% for hourly, daily and peak PM10 concentrations. At last, we give a first insight of the ensemble ability to forecast threshold exceedances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Technology Characterization Models and Their Use in Systems Design	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article							CONCEPT SELECTION	Prior research suggests that set-based design representations can be useful for facilitating collaboration among engineers in a design project. However, existing set-based methods are limited in terms of how the sets are constructed and in their representational capability. The focus of this article is on the problem of modeling the capabilities of a component technology in a way that can be communicated and used in support of system-level decision making. The context is the system definition phases of a systems engineering project, when engineers still are considering various technical concepts. The approach under investigation requires engineers familiar with the component-or subsystem-level technologies to generate a set-based model of their achievable technical attributes, called a technology characterization model (TCM). Systems engineers then use these models to explore system-level alternatives and choose the combination of technologies that are best suited to the design problem. Previously, this approach was shown to be theoretically sound from a decision making perspective under idealized circumstances. This article is an investigation into the practical effectiveness of different TCM representational methods under realistic conditions such as having limited data. A power plant systems engineering problem is used as an example, with TCMs generated for different technical concepts for the condenser component. Samples of valid condenser realizations are used as inputs to the TCM representation methods. Two TCM representation methods are compared based on their solution accuracy and computational effort required: a Kriging-based interpolation and a machine learning technique called support vector domain description (SVDD). The results from this example hold that the SVDD-based method provides the better combination of accuracy and efficiency.

Intrinsic dimension of data sets is a key parameter for dimensionality reduction. In this paper, a new intrinsic dimension estimation method based on geometrical relationship between manifold intrinsic dimension and data neighborhood geodesic distances is presented. The estimator is derived by manifold sampling assumption. On a densely sampled manifold, the number of samples that fall into a ball is equal to the volume times the density of the ball. The radius of the ball is calculated by graph distance which is approximation of geodesic distance on manifold. Then the intrinsic dimension is estimated on each sample. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real world data set show that the performance of our new method is robust and comparable to other works. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, researchers have formulated this task as supervised or unsupervised learning problems to leverage machine learning methods to improve detection accuracy. However, texture suppression, which is important for boundary detection, is not incorporated in this framework. To address this limitation, and also motivated by psychophysical and neurophysiological findings, we propose an orientation contrast model for boundary detection, which combines machine learning technique and texture suppression in a unified framework. Thus, the model is especially suited for detecting object boundaries surrounded by natural textures. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the improved boundary detection performance of the model. Specifically, its detection accuracy was improved by 10% on the Rug dataset compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised boundary detection algorithm, and its performance is also better or at least comparable with previous supervised boundary detection algorithms.

Ensemble of CoMFA models were build with excellent values of statistical matrices where genetic algorithm was applied in a conformation selection step on a dataset clustered over chemical space to ensure high degree of structural variability with correlation. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional descriptors were used vigorously to classify actives from inactives by extracting useful correlation among selected descriptors. Nevertheless, the entire hypothesis was pipelined sequentially in the pursuit of proposing probable actives from Maybridge database on the basis of docking, machine learning classification, and CoMFA studies. After ADME filtering, a set of 26 compounds from the Maybridge database were finally predicted to be plausible inhibitors of PfENR satisfying multiple computational validation models.

Amphibians over the edge: silent extinction risk of Data Deficient species	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Anura; Caudata; Gymnophiona; IUCN Redlist; machine learning; predictive model	SOUTHEAST-ASIAN BIODIVERSITY; RANDOM FORESTS; HABITAT LOSS; LAND-USE; CONSERVATION; DECLINES; MAMMALS; FROGS; VERTEBRATES; PRIORITIES	Aim To apply mathematical models to the task of predicting extinction risk for species currently listed as 'Data Deficient' (DD) by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We demonstrate this approach by applying it globally to amphibians, the vertebrate group recognized as being most extinction threatened and having the largest proportion of DD species. We combine model predictions with current extinction risk knowledge to highlight regions of greatest disparity between known and predicted risk, where potential species extinctions may be overlooked. Location Global. Methods Using global amphibian distribution data obtained from the IUCN and species trait data, we apply machine learning randomForest models to predict extinction risk of DD species from life history traits, environmental variables and habitat loss. These models are trained using data for species that have been assigned to an extinction risk category (other than DD) by the IUCN. We then combine predictions for DD species with IUCN assessment data in a GIS framework to highlight anomalies between current knowledge of amphibian extinction risk and our model predictions. Results We show that DD amphibian species are likely to be more threatened with extinction than their fully assessed counterparts. Regions in South America, central Africa and North Asia are particularly at risk due to lack of species knowledge and higher extinction risk than currently recognized. Main conclusions Application of predictive models ranking regions and species most in need of primary research allows prioritization of limited resources in an informed context, minimizing risk of unnoticed species' extinction.

Sparse optimization in feature selection: application in neuroimaging	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Sparse optimization; Feature selection; Machine learning; fMRI; Cognitive neuroscience; Regularization; Pattern classification	VENTRAL TEMPORAL CORTEX; MUTUAL INFORMATION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; REGRESSION; FMRI; CLASSIFICATION; REGULARIZATION; REPRESENTATIONS; OBJECTS; FACES	Feature selection plays an important role in the successful application of machine learning techniques to large real-world datasets. Avoiding model overfitting, especially when the number of features far exceeds the number of observations, requires selecting informative features and/or eliminating irrelevant ones. Searching for an optimal subset of features can be computationally expensive. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) produces datasets with such characteristics creating challenges for applying machine learning techniques to classify cognitive states based on fMRI data. In this study, we present an embedded feature selection framework that integrates sparse optimization for regularization (or sparse regularization) and classification. This optimization approach attempts to maximize training accuracy while simultaneously enforcing sparsity by penalizing the objective function for the coefficients of the features. This process allows many coefficients to become zero, which effectively eliminates their corresponding features from the classification model. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we apply our framework to three different real-world fMRI datasets. The results show that regularized classifiers yield better classification accuracy, especially when the number of initial features is large. The results further show that sparse regularization is key to achieving scientifically-relevant generalizability and functional localization of classifier features. The approach is thus highly suited for analysis of fMRI data.	[Kampa, K.; Chaovalitwongse, W. A.] Univ Washington, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kampa, K.; Chaovalitwongse, W.

Task arrival and execution processes are stochastic. How to adapt to the consequent uncertainties, as well as scheduling overhead and response time, are the main concern in dynamic scheduling. Based on the decision theory, scheduling is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). To address this problem, an approach from machine learning is used to learn task arrival and execution patterns online. The proposed algorithm can automatically acquire such knowledge without any aforehand modeling, and proactively allocate tasks on account of the forthcoming tasks and their execution dynamics. Under comparison with four classic algorithms such as Min-Min, Min-Max, Suffrage, and ECT, the proposed algorithm has much less scheduling overhead. The experiments over both synthetic and practical environments reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of the average response time. The smaller variance of average response time further validates the robustness of our algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Nearest-neighbor imputation; Plant community composition; Random forest; Species distribution modelling; Vegetation mapping; Western Oregon	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST INVENTORY; UNITED-STATES; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; OREGON; MUSEUM	Aim: Landscape management and conservation planning require maps of vegetation composition and structure over large regions. Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for individual species, but projects mapping multiple species are rarer. We compare maps of plant community composition assembled by stacking results from many SDMs with multivariate maps constructed using nearest-neighbor imputation. Location: Western Cascades ecoregion, Oregon and California, USA. Methods: We mapped distributions and abundances of 28 tree species over 4,007,110 ha at 30-m resolution using three approaches: SDMs using machine learning (random forest) to yield: (1) binary (RF_Bin); (2) basal area (abundance; RF_Abund) predictions; and (3) multi-species basal area predictions using a nearest-neighbor imputation variant based on random forest (RF_NN). We evaluated accuracy of binary predictions for all models, compared area mapped with plot-based areal estimates, assessed species abundance at two spatial scales and evaluated communities for species richness, problematic compositional errors and overall community composition. Results: RF_Bin yielded the strongest binary predictions (median True Skill Statistics; RF_Bin: 0.57, RF_NN: 0.38, RF_Abund: 0.27). Plot-scale predictions of abundance were poor for RF_Abund and RF_NN (median Agreement Coefficient (AC): -1.77 and -2.28), but strong when summarized over 50-km radius tessellated hexagons (median AC for both: 0.79). RF_Abund's strength with abundance and weakness with binary predictions stems from predicting small values instead of zeros. The number of zero value predictions from RF_NN was closest to counts of zeros in the plot data. Correspondingly, RF_NN's map-based species area estimates closely matched plot-based area estimates. RF_NN also performed best for community-level accuracy metrics. Conclusions: RF_NN was the best technique for building a broad-scale map of diversity and composition because the modelling framework maintained inter-species relationships from the input plot data. Re-assembling communities from single variable maps often yielded unrealistic communities. Although RF_NN rarely excelled at single species predictions of presence or abundance, it was often adequate to many (but not all) applications in both dimensions. We discuss our results in the context of map utility for applications in the fields of ecology, conservation and natural resource management planning. We highlight how RF_NN is well-suited for mapping current but not future vegetation.

We report on modeling of profiling experiments involving 429 potential inhibitors and a panel of 24 different kinases using support vector machine (SVM) techniques and naive Bayesian classification. The experimental matrix contained many different activity profiles. SVM predictions achieved overall high accuracy due to consistently low false-positive and consistently high true-negative rates. However, predictions for promiscuous inhibitors were affected by false-negative rates. Combined target-based SVM classifiers reached or exceeded the performance of SVM profile prediction methods and were superior to Bayesian classification. The classifiers displayed different prediction characteristics including diverse combinations of false-positive and true-negative rates. Predicted and experimentally observed compound activity profiles were compared in detail, revealing activity patterns modeled with different accuracy.

J	Wang, Q; Zhu, GK; Yuan, Y				Wang, Qi; Zhu, Guokang; Yuan, Yuan			Statistical quantization for similarity search	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						Machine learning; Computer vision; Similarity search; Hashing; Quantization; Binary code	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SEARCH; RETRIEVAL; CODES	Approximate nearest neighbor search has attracted much attention recently, which allows for fast query with a predictable sacrifice in search quality. Among the related works, k-means quantizers are possibly the most adaptive methods, and have shown the superiority on search accuracy than the others. However, a common problem shared by the traditional quantizers is that during the out-of-sample extension process, the naive strategy considers only the similarities in Euclidean space without taking into account the statistical and geometrical properties of the data. To cope with this problem, in this paper a novel approach is proposed by formulating a generalized likelihood ratio analysis. In particular, the proposed method takes a physically meaningful discrimination on the affiliations of the new samples with respect to the obtained Voronoi cells. This discrimination essentially imposes the measure of statistical consistency on out-of-sample extension. The experimental studies on two large data sets show that the proposed method is more effective than the benchmark algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It proposes the use of ML within the context of fire risk prediction, and more specifically, in the evaluation of human-induced wildfires in Spain. In this context, three ML algorithms Random Forest (RF), Boosting Regression Trees (BRT), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)-are implemented and compared with traditional methods like Logistic Regression (LR). Results suggest that the use of any of these ML algorithms leads to an improvement in the accuracy-in terms of the AUC (area under the curve) of the model when compared to LR outputs. According to the AUC values, RF and BRT seem to be the most adequate methods, reaching AUC values of 0.746 and 0.730 respectively. On the other hand, despite the fact that the SVM yields an AUC value higher than that from LR, the authors consider it inadequate for classifying wildfire occurrences because its calibration is extremely timeconsuming.

Holistic environmental soil-landscape modeling of soil organic carbon	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Environmental soil-landscape modeling; STEP-AWBH model; Soil organic carbon; Variable selection; Categorical variables; Data reduction	LAND-USE CHANGE; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; FEATURE-SELECTION; BIOTIC CONTROLS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STOCKS; DECOMPOSITION; GRASSLANDS; FEEDBACKS; TURNOVER	In environmental soil-landscape modeling (ESLM), the selection of predictive variables is commonly contingent on the researchers' domain expertise on soil environment processes. This variable selection strategy may suffer bias or even fail in regions where the process knowledge is insufficient. To overcome this problem, this study demonstrates a holistic ESLM framework which consists of five components: model conceptualization, data compilation, process identification, parsimonious model calibration, and model validation. Based on the STEP-AWBH conceptual model, a comprehensive pool of 210 potential environmental variables that exhaustively cover pedogenic and environmental factors was constructed. This was followed by strategic variable selection and development of parsimonious prediction models using machine learning techniques. The all-relevant variable selection successfully identified the major and minor factors relevant to the SOC variation, showing that the major factors important for explaining SOC variation in Florida were vegetation and soil water gradient. Topography and climate showed moderate effects on SOC variation. Parsimonious SOC models developed using four minimal-optimal variable selection techniques and simulated annealing yielded optimal predictive performance with minimal model complexity. The holistic ESLM framework not only provides a new view of selecting and utilizing variables for predicting soil properties but can also assist in identifying the underlying processes of soil-environment systems of interest. Due to the flexibility of the framework to incorporate various types of variable selection and modeling techniques, the holistic environmental modeling strategy can be generalized to other environmental modeling domains for both prediction and process identification.

Methods: The label and control images of ASL MRI were separated using a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM). The perfusion-weighted image was subsequently extracted from the multivariate (all voxels) SVM classifier. Using the same pre-processing steps, the proposed method was compared with standard ASL CBF quantification method using synthetic data and in-vivo ASL images. Results: As compared with the conventional univariate approach, the proposed ASL CBF quantification method significantly improved spatial signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and image appearance of ASL CBF images. Conclusion: the multivariate machine learning-based classification is useful for ASL CBF quantification. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2869-2875, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ADHD patients have consistent neurofunctional deficits in motor response inhibition. The aim of this study was to apply pattern classification to task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of inhibition, to accurately predict the diagnostic status of ADHD. Thirty adolescent ADHD and thirty age-matched healthy boys underwent fMRI while performing a Stop task. fMRI data were analyzed with Gaussian process classifiers (GPC), a machine learning approach, to predict individual ADHD diagnosis based on task-based activation patterns. Traditional univariate case-control analyses were also performed to replicate previous findings in a relatively large dataset. The pattern of brain activation correctly classified up to 90% of patients and 63% of controls, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 77%. The regions of the discriminative network most predictive of controls included later developing lateral prefrontal, striatal, and temporo-parietal areas that mediate inhibition, while regions most predictive of ADHD were in earlier developing ventromedial fronto-limbic regions, which furthermore correlated with symptom severity. Univariate analysis showed reduced activation in ADHD in bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal, striatal, and temporo-parietal regions that overlapped with areas predictive of controls, suggesting the latter are dysfunctional areas in ADHD. We show that significant individual classification of ADHD patients of 77% can be achieved using whole brain pattern analysis of task-based fMRI inhibition data, suggesting that multivariate pattern recognition analyses of inhibition networks can provide objective diagnostic neuroimaging biomarkers of ADHD.

The analysis pipeline included three stages, namely, clustering, glaucoma boundary limit detection, and glaucoma progression detection testing. First, cross-sectional visual field tests collected from each subject were clustered using a mixture of Gaussians and model parameters were estimated using expectation maximization. The visual field clusters were further estimated to recognize glaucomatous visual field defect patterns by decomposing each cluster into several axes. The glaucoma visual field defect patterns along each axis then were identified. To derive a definition of progression, the longitudinal visual fields of stable glaucoma eyes on the abnormal cluster axes were projected and the slope was approximated using linear regression (LR) to determine the confidence limit of each axis. For glaucoma progression detection, the longitudinal visual fields of each eye on the abnormal cluster axes were projected and the slope was approximated by LR. Progression was assigned if the progression rate was greater than the boundary limit of the stable eyes; otherwise, stability was assumed. The proposed method was compared to a recently developed progression detection method and to clinically available glaucoma progression detection software. The clinical accuracy of the proposed pipeline was as good as or better than the currently available methods.

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee and informed consent was signed. Structural, diffusion-and perfusion-weighted MRI was performed at 1.5-T preoperatively in 94 adult patients (49 males, 45 females, 23-82 years; mean 51 years) later diagnosed with a primary glioma. Patients were randomly assigned in training and test datasets and the resulting DSC-based survival associations by SVM were compared to traditional MRI features including contrast-agent enhancement, perfusion-and diffusion-weighted imaging, tumor size, and location. The results were adjusted for age, neurological status, and postoperative factors associated with survival, including surgery and adjuvant therapy. Results: For 1- (26/33 alive, 11/14 deceased), 2- (15/21, 21/26), 3- (12/16, 27/31) and 4- (12/15, 28/32) year survival associations in the test dataset (47 patients), the SVM routine was the only biomarker to consistently associate with survival (Cox; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The automatic machine learning routine presented in our study may provide the operator with a reliable instrument for assessing survival in patients with glioma.

Our objectives were to investigate the utility of boosted regression trees (BRTs) for predictive modeling of FHB epidemics in the United States, and to compare the predictive performances of the BRT models with those of logistic regression models we had developed previously. The data included 527 FHB observations from 15 states over 26 years. BRTs were fit to a training data set of 369 FHB observations, in which FHB epidemics were classified as either major (severity >= 10%) or non-major (severity < 10%), linked to a predictor matrix consisting of 350 weather-based variables and categorical variables for wheat type (spring or winter), presence or absence of corn residue, and cultivar resistance. Predictive performance was estimated on a test (holdout) data set consisting of the remaining 158 observations. BRTs had a misclassification rate of 0.23 on the test data, which was 31% lower than the average misclassification rate over 15 logistic regression models we had presented earlier. The strongest predictors were generally one of mean daily relative humidity, mean daily temperature, and the number of hours in which the temperature was between 9 and 30 degrees C and relative humidity >= 90% simultaneously. Moreover, the predicted risk of major epidemics increased substantially when mean daily relative humidity rose above 70%, which is a lower threshold than previously modeled for most plant pathosystems. BRTs led to novel insights into the weather-epidemic relationship.	[Shah, D. A.; De Wolf, E. D.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Plant Pathol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Paul, P. A.; Madden, L.

Unlike most existing machine learning binding site prediction methods, PAIRpred uses information from both proteins in a protein complex to predict pairs of interacting residues from the two proteins. PAIRpred captures sequence and structure information about residue pairs through pairwise kernels that are used for training a support vector machine classifier. As a result, PAIRpred presents a more detailed model of protein binding, and offers state of the art accuracy in predicting binding sites at the protein level as well as inter-protein residue contacts at the complex level. We demonstrate PAIRpred's performance on Docking Benchmark 4.0 and recent CAPRI targets. We present a detailed performance analysis outlining the contribution of different sequence and structure features, together with a comparison to a variety of existing interface prediction techniques. We have also studied the impact of binding-associated conformational change on prediction accuracy and found PAIRpred to be more robust to such structural changes than existing schemes. As an illustration of the potential applications of PAIRpred, we provide a case study in which PAIRpred is used to analyze the nature and specificity of the interface in the interaction of human ISG15 protein with NS1 protein from influenza A virus. Python code for PAIRpred is available at . Proteins 2014; 82:1142-1155. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Martin, J				Martin, Juliette			Benchmarking protein-protein interface predictions: Why you should care about protein size	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						benchmark; protein; interface; prediction; bias; machine learning; assessment; structure; protein-protein interaction	BINDING-SITES; RESIDUES; CURVES	A number of predictive methods have been developed to predict protein-protein binding sites. Each new method is traditionally benchmarked using sets of protein structures of various sizes, and global statistics are used to assess the quality of the prediction. Little attention has been paid to the potential bias due to protein size on these statistics. Indeed, small proteins involve proportionally more residues at interfaces than large ones. If a predictive method is biased toward small proteins, this can lead to an over-estimation of its performance. Here, we investigate the bias due to the size effect when benchmarking protein-protein interface prediction on the widely used docking benchmark 4.0. First, we simulate random scores that favor small proteins over large ones. Instead of the 0.5 AUC (Area Under the Curve) value expected by chance, these biased scores result in an AUC equal to 0.6 using hypergeometric distributions, and up to 0.65 using constant scores. We then use real prediction results to illustrate how to detect the size bias by shuffling, and subsequently correct it using a simple conversion of the scores into normalized ranks. In addition, we investigate the scores produced by eight published methods and show that they are all affected by the size effect, which can change their relative ranking. The size effect also has an impact on linear combination scores by modifying the relative contributions of each method. In the future, systematic corrections should be applied when benchmarking predictive methods using data sets with mixed protein sizes. Proteins 2014; 82:1444-1452. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Miscanthus spatial location as seen by farmers: A machine learning approach to model real criteria	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY			English	Article						Bioenergy crop; Land parcel identification system (LPIS); Landscape agronomy; Boosted regression trees (BRT); France; Marginal land	BOOSTED REGRESSION TREES; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; PERENNIAL ENERGY CROPS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SUS-SCROFA L.; LAND-USE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; BIOENERGY PRODUCTION; FEEDSTOCK PRODUCTION; BIOMASS PRODUCTION	Miscanthus is an emerging crop with high potential for bioenergy production. Its effective sustainability depends greatly on the spatial location of this crop, although few modelling approaches have been based on real maps. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially explicit method based on real location data. We mapped all of the miscanthus fields in the supply area of a transformation plant located in east-central France. Then, we used a boosted regression tree, machine learning method, to model miscanthus presence/absence at the level of the farmer's block as mapped in the French land parcel identification system. Each of these modelling spatial units was characterised on agronomical, morphological and contextual variables selected from in-depth spatially explicit farm surveys. The model fostered a two-fold aim: to assess the farmers' decision criteria and predict miscanthus location probability. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of possible legislative constraints, which could prevent the miscanthus to be planted in protected areas or in place of grasslands. The small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks that were predicted by our model to be planted with miscanthus were also characterised by their great distance from the farm and the roads. This kind of result could provide a different perspective on the definition of "marginal land" by integrating also the farm management criteria. In conclusion, our approach elicited real farmers' criteria regarding miscanthus location to capture local specificities and explore different miscanthus location probabilities at the farm and landscape levels.

Currently, opcode sequences are extracted using text-based methods, and the limitation of this method is that the extracted opcode sequences cannot represent the true behaviors of an executable. To solve this issue, we present a control flow-based method to extract executable opcode behaviors. The behaviors extracted by this method can fully represent the behavior characteristics of an executable. To verify the efficiency of control flow-based behaviors, we perform a comparative study of the two types of opcode behavior analysis methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed control flow-based method has a higher overall accuracy and a lower false positive rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The basic task is to classify network activities (in the network log as connection records) as normal or abnormal while minimizing misclassification. Although different classification models have been developed for network intrusion detection, each of them has its strengths and weaknesses, including the most commonly applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) method and the Clustering based on Self-Organized Ant Colony Network (CSOACN). Our new approach combines the SVM method with CSOACNs to take the advantages of both while avoiding their weaknesses. Our algorithm is implemented and evaluated using a standard benchmark KDD99 data set. Experiments show that CSVAC (Combining Support Vectors with Ant Colony) outperforms SVM alone or CSOACN alone in terms of both classification rate and run-time efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A Unifying Framework for Typical Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning Problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; optimization methods; pattern recognition; supervised learning; support vector machines (SVMs)	SUPPORT; SPARSITY	Over the past few years, multiple kernel learning (MKL) has received significant attention among data-driven feature selection techniques in the context of kernel-based learning. MKL formulations have been devised and solved for a broad spectrum of machine learning problems, including multitask learning (MTL). Solving different MKL formulations usually involves designing algorithms that are tailored to the problem at hand, which is, typically, a nontrivial accomplishment. In this paper we present a general multitask multiple kernel learning (MT-MKL) framework that subsumes well-known MT-MKL formulations, as well as several important MKL approaches on single-task problems. We then derive a simple algorithm that can solve the unifying framework. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed framework, we formulate a new learning problem, namely partially-shared common space MT-MKL, and demonstrate its merits through experimentation.

The EPM stems from nonlinear rescaling and augmented Lagrangian methods and allows iterates to approach the solution of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem from the exterior of the feasible set. Furthermore, the EPM produces and solves a well-conditioned system of linear equations at each iteration; thus, avoiding numerical inaccuracies that can occur when solving ill-conditioned systems. Therefore, the EPM may be an attractive alternative to existing quadratic programming solvers for training SVMs. We report numerical results for training the SVM with the EPM on data up to several thousand data points from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Though many available off-the-shelf metrics can be selected to achieve some learning tasks at hand such as for k-nearest neighbor classification and k-means clustering, such a selection is not necessarily always appropriate due to its independence on data itself. It has been proved that a task-dependent metric learned from the given data can yield more beneficial learning performance. Inspired by such success, we focus on learning an embedded metric specially for support vector regression and present a corresponding learning algorithm termed as SVRML, which both minimizes the error on the validation dataset and simultaneously enforces the sparsity on the learned metric matrix. Further taking the learned metric (positive semi-definite matrix) as a base learner, we develop a bagging-like effective ensemble metric learning framework in which the resampling mechanism of original bagging is specially modified for SVRML Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the single and bagging-based ensemble metric learnings for support vector regression.

A support vector machine is used to classify a group of subjects as either ADHD or non-ADHD and a classification accuracy of greater than 95% has been achieved.

If missed before birth, the early detection of Down syndrome is crucial for the management of patients and disease. However, the diagnostic accuracy for pediatricians prior to cytogenetic results is moderate and the access to specialists is limited in many social and low-economic areas. In this study, we propose a simple, non-invasive and automated framework for Down syndrome detection based on disease-specific facial patterns. Geometric and local texture features are extracted based on automatically detected anatomical landmarks to describe facial morphology and structure. To accurately locate the anatomical facial landmarks, a hierarchical constrained local model using independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed. We also introduce a data-driven ordering method for selecting dominant independent components in ICA. The hierarchical structure of the model increases the accuracy of landmark detection by fitting separate models to different groups. Then the most representative features are selected and we also demonstrate that they match clinical observations. Finally, a variety of classifiers are evaluated to discriminate between Down syndrome and healthy populations. The best performance achieved 0.967 accuracy and 0.956 F-1 score using combined features and linear discriminant analysis. The method was also validated on a dataset with mixed genetic syndromes and high performance (0.970 accuracy and 0.930 F-1 score) was also obtained. The promising results indicate that our method could assist in Down syndrome screening effectively in a simple, non-invasive way, and extensible to detection of other genetic syndromes.

In this paper, we propose to use a multiple instance learning (MIL) method in an application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our work, local intensity patches are extracted as features. However, not all the patches extracted from patients with dementia are equally affected by the disease and some of them may not be characteristic of morphology associated with the disease. Therefore, there is some ambiguity in assigning disease labels to these patches. The problem of the ambiguous training labels can be addressed by weakly supervised learning techniques such as MIL A graph is built for each image to exploit the relationships among the patches and then to solve the MIL problem. The constructed graphs contain information about the appearances of patches and the relationships among them, which can reflect the inherent structures of images and aids the classification. Using the baseline MR images of 834 subjects from the ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 89% between AD patients and healthy controls, and 70% between patients defined as stable MCI and progressive MCI in a leave-one-out cross validation. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods using the same dataset, the proposed method can achieve similar or improved results, providing an alternative framework for the detection and prediction of neurodegenerative diseases.

Inspired by previous work on crowdsourcing, we investigate the viability of using non-expert labels instead of gold standard annotations from experts for a machine learning approach to automatic readability prediction. In order to do so, we evaluate two different methodologies to assess the readability of a wide variety of text material: A more traditional setup in which expert readers make readability judgments and a crowdsourcing setup for users who are not necessarily experts. To this purpose two assessment tools were implemented: a tool where expert readers can rank a batch of texts based on readability, and a lightweight crowdsourcing tool, which invites users to provide pairwise comparisons. To validate this approach, readability assessments for a corpus of written Dutch generic texts were gathered. By collecting multiple assessments per text, we explicitly wanted to level out readers' background knowledge and attitude. Our findings show that the assessments collected through both methodologies are highly consistent and that crowdsourcing is a viable alternative to expert labeling. This is a good news as crowdsourcing is more lightweight to use and can have access to a much wider audience of potential annotators. By performing a set of basic machine learning experiments using a feature set that mainly encodes basic lexical and morpho-syntactic information, we further illustrate how the collected data can be used to perform text comparisons or to assign an absolute readability score to an individual text. We do not focus on optimising the algorithms to achieve the best possible results for the learning tasks, but carry them out to illustrate the various possibilities of our data sets. The results on different data sets, however, show that our system outperforms the readability formulas and a baseline language modelling approach. We conclude that readability assessment by comparing texts is a polyvalent methodology, which can be adapted to specific domains and target audiences if required.

We obtained a breakthrough in terms of the automatic extraction of definitions, by extensively and systematically experimenting with different sampling techniques and their combination, as well as a range of different types of classifiers. Performance consistently scored in the range of 0.95-0.99 of area under the receiver operating characteristics, with a notorious improvement between 17 and 22 percentage points regarding the baseline of 0.73-0.77, for datasets with different rates of imbalance. Thus, the present paper also represents a contribution to the seminal work in natural language processing that points toward the importance of exploring the research path of applying sampling techniques to mitigate the bias induced by highly imbalanced datasets, and thus greatly improving the performance of a large range of tools that rely on them.

We study a particular kind of reservoir computers called time-delay reservoirs that are constructed out of the sampling of the solution of a time-delay differential equation and show their good performance in the forecasting of the conditional covariances associated to multivariate discrete-time nonlinear stochastic processes of VEC-GARCH type as well as in the prediction of factual daily market realized volatilities computed with intraday quotes, using as training input daily fog-return series of moderate size. We tackle some problems associated to the lack of task-universality for individually operating reservoirs and propose a solution based on the use of parallel arrays of time-delay reservoirs.

However, it only uses labeled samples while neglecting unlabeled samples, which are abundant and can be easily obtained in the real world. In this paper, we propose a new dimension reduction method, called "SL-LDA", by using unlabeled samples to enhance the performance of LDA. The new method first propagates label information from the labeled set to the unlabeled set via a label propagation process, where the predicted labels of unlabeled samples, called "soft labels", can be obtained. It then incorporates the soft labels into the construction of scatter matrixes to find a transformed matrix for dimension reduction. In this way, the proposed method can preserve more discriminative information, which is preferable when solving the classification problem. We further propose an efficient approach for solving SL-LDA under a least squares framework, and a flexible method of SL-LDA (FSL-LDA) to better cope with datasets sampled from a nonlinear manifold. Extensive simulations are carried out on several datasets, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, Mingbo; Chow, Tommy W.

Comparison of classification algorithms to predict outcomes of feedlot cattle identified and treated for bovine respiratory disease	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Bovine respiratory disease; Machine learning; Cattle; Diagnosis	YOUDEN INDEX; PERFORMANCE; MORTALITY; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POINT; TESTS	Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) continues to be the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in feedyard cattle. Accurate identification of those animals that will not finish the production cycle normally following initial treatment for BRD would provide feedyard managers with opportunities to more effectively manage those animals. Our objectives were to assess the ability of different classification algorithms to accurately predict an individual calf's outcome based on data available at first identification of and treatment for BRD and also to identify characteristics of calves where predictive models performed well as gauged by accuracy. Data from 23 feedyards in multiple geographic locations within the U.S. from 2000 to 2009 representing over one million animals were analyzed to identify animals clinically diagnosed with BRD and treated with an antimicrobial. These data were analyzed both as a single dataset and as multiple datasets based on individual feedyards and partitioned into training, testing, and validation datasets. Classifiers were trained and optimized to identify calves that did not finish the production cycle with their cohort. Following classifier training, accuracy was evaluated using validation data. Analysis was also done to identify sub-groups of calves within populations where classifiers performed better compared to other sub-groups. Accuracy of individual classifiers varied by dataset. The accuracy of the best performing classifier by dataset ranged from a low of 63% in one dataset up to 95% in a different dataset. Sub-groups of calves were identified within some datasets where accuracy of a classifiers were greater than 98%; however these accuracies must be interpreted in relation to the prevalence of the class of interest within those populations. We found that by pairing the correct classifier with the data available, accurate predictions could be made that would provide feedlot managers with valuable information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we describe the design of an adaptable decision support system and its integration with a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN) to implement autonomous closed-loop zone-specific irrigation. Using an ontology for defining the application logic emphasizes system flexibility and adaptability and supports the application of automatic inferential and validation mechanisms. Furthermore, a machine learning process has been applied for inducing new rules by analyzing logged datasets for extracting new knowledge and extending the system ontology in order to cope, for example, with a sensor type failure or to improve the accuracy of a plant state diagnosis. A deployment of the system is presented for zone specific irrigation control in a greenhouse setting. Evaluation of the developed system was performed in terms of derivation of new rules by the machine learning process, WSN performance and mote lifetime. The effectiveness of the developed system was validated by comparing its agronomic performance to traditional agricultural practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, an effective method based on a combined image processing and machine learning was presented and evaluated for segmenting almond images with different classes such as normal almond, broken and split almond, shell of almond, wrinkled almond and doubles or twins almond. One of the major difficulties encountered in segmenting almonds was the existence of shadow on the background of the acquired images. Another difficulty was separating almonds with various shapes and colors from input images. To implement an effective algorithm, initially a suitable set of color features was extracted from the images. Then, sensitivity analysis was used to select the best features. Finally, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were adopted to classify the images into three categories, namely, object, shadow and background. The optimum ANN classifier had a 8-5-3 structure, i.e., it was consisted of an input layer with eight input variables, one hidden layer with five neurons and three neurons as output. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the results of our optimum ANN model were compared with Otsu, dynamic thresholding and watershed methods. The mean values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for object class (detected almonds from images) achieved by using the proposed method were 96.88, 99.21 and 98.82, respectively. It gave a better accuracy than the mentioned methods. In addition, the proposed method was able to separate the almonds from the background and shadows more efficiently. The processing time of the proposed method was 1.35 s which makes it possible for real time applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nicolaou, MA; Pavlovic, V; Pantic, M				Nicolaou, Mihalis A.; Pavlovic, Vladimir; Pantic, Maja			Dynamic Probabilistic CCA for Analysis of Affective Behavior and Fusion of Continuous Annotations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Fusion of continuous annotations; component analysis; temporal alignment; dimensional emotion; affect analysis		Fusing multiple continuous expert annotations is a crucial problem in machine learning and computer vision, particularly when dealing with uncertain and subjective tasks related to affective behavior. Inspired by the concept of inferring shared and individual latent spaces in Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (PCCA), we propose a novel, generative model that discovers temporal dependencies on the shared/individual spaces (Dynamic Probabilistic CCA, DPCCA). In order to accommodate for temporal lags, which are prominent amongst continuous annotations, we further introduce a latent warping process, leading to the DPCCA with Time Warpings (DPCTW) model. Finally, we propose two supervised variants of DPCCA/DPCTW which incorporate inputs (i.e. visual or audio features), both in a generative (SG-DPCCA) and discriminative manner (SD-DPCCA). We show that the resulting family of models (i) can be used as a unifying framework for solving the problems of temporal alignment and fusion of multiple annotations in time, (ii) can automatically rank and filter annotations based on latent posteriors or other model statistics, and (iii) that by incorporating dynamics, modeling annotation-specific biases, noise estimation, time warping and supervision, DPCTW outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both the aggregation of multiple, yet imperfect expert annotations as well as the alignment of affective behavior.

J	Liu, Q; Liu, Z				Liu, Qiong; Liu, Zhen			A comparison of improving multi-class imbalance for internet traffic classification	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						Multi-class imbalance; Resampling; Cost-sensitive learning; Internet traffic classification		Most research of class imbalance is focused on two class problem to date. A multi-class imbalance is so complicated that one has little knowledge and experience in Internet traffic classification. In this paper we study the challenges posed by Internet traffic classification using machine learning with multi-class unbalanced data and the ability of some adjusting methods, including resampling (random under-sampling, random over-sampling) and cost-sensitive learning. Then we empirically compare the effectiveness of these methods for Internet traffic classification and determine which produces better overall classifier and under what circumstances. Main works are as below. (1) Cost-sensitive learning is deduced with MetaCost that incorporates the misclassification costs into the learning algorithm for improving multi-class imbalance based on flow ratio. (2) A new resampling model is presented including under-sampling and over-sampling to make the multi-class training data more balanced. (3) The solution is presented to compare among three methods or to compare three methods with original case. Experiment results are shown on sixteen datasets that flow g-mean and byte g-mean are statistically increased by 8.6 % and 3.7 %; 4.4 % and 2.8 %; 11.1 % and 8.2 % when three methods are compared with original case. Cost-sensitive learning is as the first choice when the sample size is enough, but resampling is more practical in the rest.

Using active learning, we learn a model M (R) of reference implementation R, which serves as input for a model-based testing tool that checks conformance of implementation I to M (R) . In addition, we also explore an alternative approach in which we learn a model M (I) of implementation I, which is compared to model M (R) using an equivalence checker. Our work uses a unique combination of software tools for model construction (Uppaal), active learning (LearnLib, Tomte), model-based testing (JTorX, TorXakis) and verification (CADP, MRMC). We show how these tools can be used for learning models of and revealing errors in implementations, present the new notion of a conformance oracle, and demonstrate how conformance oracles can be used to speed up conformance checking.

J	Choi, SP; Lee, S; Jung, H; Song, SK				Choi, Sung-Pil; Lee, Seungwoo; Jung, Hanmin; Song, Sa-kwang			An intensive case study on kernel-based relation extraction	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Relation extraction; Kernel methods; Text mining; Information extraction; Machine learning	PERCEPTRON; TEXT; WEB	Relation extraction refers to a method of efficiently detecting and identifying predefined semantic relationships within a set of entities in text documents. Numerous relation extractionfc techniques have been developed thus far, owing to their innate importance in the domain of information extraction and text mining. The majority of the relation extraction methods proposed to date is based on a supervised learning method requiring the use of learning collections; such learning methods can be classified into feature-based, semi-supervised, and kernel-based techniques. Among these methods, a case analysis on a kernel-based relation extraction method, considered the most successful of the three approaches, is carried out in this paper. Although some previous survey papers on this topic have been published, they failed to select the most essential of the currently available kernel-based relation extraction approaches or provide an in-depth comparative analysis of them. Unlike existing case studies, the study described in this paper is based on a close analysis of the operation principles and individual characteristics of five vital representative kernel-based relation extraction methods. In addition, we present deep comparative analysis results of these methods. In addition, for further research on kernel-based relation extraction with an even higher performance and for general high-level kernel studies for linguistic processing and text mining, some additional approaches including feature-based methods based on various criteria are introduced.

Activity classification based on inertial and barometric pressure sensors at different anatomical locations	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						accelerometers; inertial measurement unit; wearable sensors; machine learning; activities of daily living; stair ascent; stair descent	DAILY PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; TRIAXIAL ACCELEROMETER; ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; MINIATURE GYROSCOPE; HUMAN MOVEMENT; REAL-TIME; LONG-TERM; POSTURE; IDENTIFICATION; RELIABILITY	Miniature, wearable sensor modules are a promising technology to monitor activities of daily living (ADL) over extended periods of time. To assure both user compliance and meaningful results, the selection and placement site of sensors requires careful consideration. We investigated these aspects for the classification of 16 ADL in 6 healthy subjects under laboratory conditions using ReSense, our custom-made inertial measurement unit enhanced with a barometric pressure sensor used to capture activity-related altitude changes. Subjects wore a module on each wrist and ankle, and one on the trunk. Activities comprised whole body movements as well as gross and dextrous upper-limb activities. Wrist-module data outperformed the other locations for the three activity groups. Specifically, overall classification accuracy rates of almost 93% and more than 95% were achieved for the repeated holdout and user-specific validation methods, respectively, for all 16 activities. Including the altitude profile resulted in a considerable improvement of up to 20% in the classification accuracy for stair ascent and descent. The gyroscopes provided no useful information for activity classification under this scheme. The proposed sensor setting could allow for robust long-term activity monitoring with high compliance in different patient populations.

Neurocognitive Pattern Analysis Reveals Classificatory Hierarchy of Attention Deficits in Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						focused attention; sustained attention; selective attention; alternating attention; divided attention; machine learning	CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE-TEST; CARD SORTING TEST; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; IMPAIRMENT; PARADIGMS; NETWORKS; MATRICS; ADULTS	Attention deficits, among other cognitive deficits, are frequently observed in schizophrenia. Although valid and reliable neurocognitive tasks have been established to assess attention deficits in schizophrenia, the hierarchical value of those tests as diagnostic discriminants on a single-subject level remains unclear. Thus, much research is devoted to attention deficits that are unlikely to be translated into clinical practice. On the other hand, a clear hierarchy of attention deficits in schizophrenia could considerably aid diagnostic decisions and may prove beneficial for longitudinal monitoring of therapeutic advances. To propose a diagnostic hierarchy of attention deficits in schizophrenia, we investigated several facets of attention in 86 schizophrenia patients and 86 healthy controls using a set of established attention tests. We applied state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to determine attentive test variables that enable an automated differentiation between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. After feature preranking, hypothesis building, and hypothesis validation, the polynomial support vector machine classifier achieved a classification accuracy of 90.70% +/- 2.9% using psychomotor speed and 3 different attention parameters derived from sustained and divided attention tasks. Our study proposes, to the best of our knowledge, the first hierarchy of attention deficits in schizophrenia by identifying the most discriminative attention parameters among a variety of attention deficits found in schizophrenia patients. Our results offer a starting point for hierarchy building of schizophrenia-associated attention deficits and contribute to translating these concepts into diagnostic and therapeutic practice on a single-subject level.

The hooded crane (Grus monacha) is a vulnerable (VU) species according to the IUCN Red List. Here, we present the first long-term Chinese legacy nest data for this species (1993-2010) with publicly available meta-data. Further, we provide the first study that reports findings on multivariate nest habitat preference using such long-term field data for this species. Our work was carried out in Northeastern China, where we found and measured 24 nests and 81 randomly selected control plots and their environmental parameters in a vast landscape. We used machine learning (stochastic boosted regression trees) to quantify nest selection. Our analysis further included varclust (R Hmisc) and (TreenNet) to address statistical correlations and two-way interactions. We found that from an initial list of 14 measured field variables, water area (+), water depth (+) and shrub coverage (-) were the main explanatory variables that contributed to hooded crane nest-site selection. Agricultural sites played a smaller role in the selection of these nests. Our results are important for the conservation management of cranes all over East Asia and constitute a defensible and quantitative basis for predictive models.

Root phenotyping by root tip detection and classification through statistical learning	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Root phenotyping; Zernike moments; Machine learning; Gaussian mixture models; Primary and lateral roots	SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; ZERNIKE MOMENTS; SOFTWARE; TOLERANCE; PLATFORM; TRAITS; BARLEY; GROWTH; PLANTS	Root branching is a fundamental phenotypic property of a root system. In this paper we present a system for the fully automated detection and classification of root tips in root images obtained either by 2D flat bed scanning or by 3D digital camera imaging. With our system we aim to provide a robust, efficient and accurate means of phenotyping of roots. Structural information derived from image features such as root ends and root branches is utilised for the detection and classification processes. A statistical analysis based on training data sets of root tips and non-root tips is used to assign image features to one of three different classes: non-root tips, primary root tips and lateral root tips. The automated procedure is optimised to ensure as high true detection rate and low false detection rate as possible. We apply the method to images of barley, rice, and corn roots taken either by 2D scanning of washed and cut roots or digital camera images of plant roots growing in a transparent medium. The results of our detection and classification procedure are validated by a comparison with manually labelled images for all three species. Our results are also compared to two established platforms, EZ-Rhizo and WinRHIZO. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the statistical learning approach by quantifying root phenotypic properties of barley double haploid lines. The method of statistical learning of characteristic features is an accurate means of not only counting root numbers, but also discriminating between primary and lateral roots. The fully-automated procedure presented in this paper can be used reliably in high throughput situations to characterise quantitative phenotypic variation.

In total, 100 heterogeneous soil samples collected from Southeast China were used as the dataset for the model calibration and independent validation. The determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), residual prediction deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range were used for the model evaluation. The results of this study show that both the PLSR and SVMR models were significantly improved by the absorbance transformation (LOG), standard normal variate with wavelet de-trending (SW), first derivative (FD), and mean centering (MC) spectral preprocessing methods and their combinations. SVMR obtained optimal models for both the DU and DG soil, with R-2, RMSE, and RPD values of 0.72, 2.48 g/kg, and 1.83 for DU soil and 0.86, 1.84 g/kg, and 2.60 for DG soil, respectively. Among all the PLSR and SVMR models, SVMR showed a more stable performance than PLSR, and it also outperformed PLSR, with a smaller mean RMSE of 0.69 g/kg for DU soil and 0.50 g/kg for DG soil. This study concludes that PLSR is an effective linear algorithm, but it might not be sufficient when dealing with a nonlinear relationship, and SVMR turned out to be a more suitable nonlinear regression method for SOC estimation. Effective SOC estimation was obtained based on the DG soil samples, but the accurate estimation of SOC with DU soil samples needs to be further explored. In addition, LOG, SW, FD, and MC are valuable spectral preprocessing methods for Vis-NIR optimization, and choosing two of them (except for FD + SW and LOG + FD) in a simple combination is a good way to get acceptable results.

J	Torres-Sospedra, J; Nebot, P				Torres-Sospedra, Joaquin; Nebot, Patricio			Two-stage procedure based on smoothed ensembles of neural networks applied to weed detection in orange groves	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Agricultural robotics; Agricultural sensing; Terrain classification	CLASSIFIER; VISION	The potential impacts of herbicide utilization compel producers to use new methods of weed control. The problem of how to reduce the amount of herbicide and yet maintain crop production has stimulated many researchers to study selective herbicide application. The key of selective herbicide application is how to discriminate the weed areas efficiently. We introduce a procedure for weed detection in orange groves which consists of two different stages. In the first stage, the main features in an image of the grove are determined (Trees, Trunks, Soil and Sky). In the second, the weeds are detected only in those areas which were determined as Soil in the first stage. Due to the characteristics of weed detection (changing weather and light conditions), we introduce a new training procedure with noisy patterns for ensembles of neural networks. In the experiments, a comparison of the new noisy learning was successfully performed with a set of well-known classification problems from the machine learning repository published by the University of California, Irvine. This first comparison was performed to determine the general behavior and performance of the noisy ensembles. Then, the new noisy ensembles were applied to images from orange groves to determine where weeds are located using the proposed two-stage procedure. Main results of this contribution show that the proposed system is suitable for weed detection in orange, and similar, groves. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The prevalent diagnosis method is based on the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test, which suffers from low specificity, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. In this work, untargeted metabolomic profiling of age-matched serum samples from prostate cancer patients and healthy individuals was performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and machine learning methods. A metabolite-based in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assay (IVDMIA) was developed to predict the presence of PCa in serum samples with high classification sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. A panel of 40 metabolic spectral features was found to be differential with 92.1% sensitivity, 94.3% specificity, and 93.0% accuracy. The performance of the IVDMIA was higher than the prevalent PSA test. Within the discriminant panel, 31 metabolites were identified by MS and MS/MS, with 10 further confirmed chromatographically by standards. Numerous discriminant metabolites were mapped in the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway. The identification of fatty acids, amino acids, lysophospholipids, and bile acids provided further insights into the metabolic alterations associated with the disease. With additional work, the results presented here show great potential toward implementation in clinical settings.

However, biases may occur if the model is misspecified. In contrast, outcome probabilities for individuals can be estimated consistently with machine learning approaches, including k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), bagged nearest neighbors (b-NN), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). Because machine learning methods are rarely used by applied biostatisticians, the primary goal of this paper is to explain the concept of probability estimation with these methods and to summarize recent theoretical findings. Probability estimation in k-NN, b-NN, and RF can be embedded into the class of nonparametric regression learning machines; therefore, we start with the construction of nonparametric regression estimates and review results on consistency and rates of convergence. In SVMs, outcome probabilities for individuals are estimated consistently by repeatedly solving classification problems. For SVMs we review classification problem and then dichotomous probability estimation. Next we extend the algorithms for estimating probabilities using k-NN, b-NN, and RF to multicategory outcomes and discuss approaches for the multicategory probability estimation problem using SVM. In simulation studies for dichotomous and multicategory dependent variables we demonstrate the general validity of the machine learning methods and compare it with logistic regression. However, each method fails in at least one simulation scenario. We conclude with a discussion of the failures and give recommendations for selecting and tuning the methods.

Specifically, we investigate k-nearest neighbors, bagged nearest neighbors, random forests for probability estimation trees, and support vector machines with the kernels of Bessel, linear, Laplacian, and radial basis type. Comparisons are made with logistic regression. The dataset from the German Stroke Study Collaboration with dichotomous and three-category outcome variables allows, in particular, for temporal and external validation. The other two datasets are freely available from the UCI learning repository and provide dichotomous outcome variables. One of them, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Heart Disease dataset, uses data from one clinic for training and from three clinics for external validation, while the other, the thyroid disease dataset, allows for temporal validation by separating data into training and test data by date of recruitment into study. For dichotomous outcome variables, we use receiver operating characteristics, areas under the curve values with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and Hosmer-Lemeshow-type figures as comparison criteria. For dichotomous and multicategory outcomes, we calculated bootstrap Brier scores with 95% confidence intervals and also compared them through bootstrapping. In a supplement, we provide R code for performing the analyses and for random forest analyses in Random Jungle, version 2.1.0. The learning machines show promising performance over all constructed models. They are simple to apply and serve as an alternative approach to logistic or multinomial logistic regression analysis.

Open-loop tomography with artificial neural networks on CANARY: on-sky results	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						atmospheric effects; instrumentation: adaptive optics	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEM; WAVE-FRONT-SENSOR; TURBULENCE; TELESCOPE; SLODAR	We present recent results from the initial testing of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based tomographic reconstructor Complex Atmospheric Reconstructor based on Machine lEarNing (CARMEN) on CANARY, an adaptive optics demonstrator operated on the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope, La Palma. The reconstructor was compared with contemporaneous data using the Learn and Apply (L&A) tomographic reconstructor. We find that the fully optimized L&A tomographic reconstructor outperforms CARMEN by approximately 5 per cent in Strehl ratio or 15 nm rms in wavefront error. We also present results for CANARY in Ground Layer Adaptive Optics mode to show that the reconstructors are tomographic. The results are comparable and this small deficit is attributed to limitations in the training data used to build the ANN. Laboratory bench tests show that the ANN can outperform L&A under certain conditions, e.g. if the higher layer of a model two layer atmosphere was to change in altitude by similar to 300 m (equivalent to a shift of approximately one tenth of a subaperture).

The Bass model is used to explain the diffusion process of products while statistical and machine learning algorithms are employed to predict two Bass model parameters prior to launch. Initially, two types of databases (DBs) are constructed: a product attribute DB and a product diffusion DB. Taking the former as inputs and the latter as outputs, single prediction models are developed using six regression algorithms, on the basis of which an ensemble prediction model is constructed in order to enhance predictive power. The experimental validation shows that most single prediction models outperform the conventional analogical method and that the ensemble model improves prediction accuracy further. Based on the developed models, an illustrative example of 3D TV is provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Artificial Neural Network Approach for Revealing Individuality, Group Membership and Age Information in Goat Kid Contact Calls	ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA			English	Article							SOURCE-FILTER THEORY; VOCAL REPERTOIRE; ALARM CALLS; CLASSIFICATION; VOCALIZATIONS; IDENTITY; CATEGORIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; PITFALLS; DOLPHINS	Machine learning techniques are becoming an important tool for studying animal vocal communication. The goat (Capra hircus) is a very social species, in which vocal communication and recognition are important. We tested the reliability of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (feed-forward Artificial Neural Network, ANN) to automate the process of classification of calls according to individual identity, group membership and maturation in this species. Vocalisations were obtained from 10 half-sibling (same father but different mothers) goat kids, belonging to 3 distinct social groups. We recorded 157 contact calls emitted during first week, and 164 additional calls recorded from the same individuals at 5 weeks. For each call, we measured 27 spectral and temporal acoustic parameters using a custom built program in Praat software. For each classification task we built stratified 10-fold cross-validated neural networks. The input nodes corresponded to the acoustic parameters measured on each signal. ANNs were trained with the error-back-propagation algorithm. The number of hidden units was set to the number of attributes + classes. Each model was trained for 350 epochs (learning rate 0.2; momentum 0.2). To estimate a reliable error for the models, we repeated 10-fold cross-validation iterations 10 times and calculated the average predictive performance. The accuracy was 71.13 +/- 1.16% for vocal individuality, 79.59 +/- 0.75% for social group and 91.37 +/- 0.76% for age of the vocalising animal. Our results demonstrate that ANNs are a powerful tool for studying vocal dues to individuality, group membership and maturation in contact calls. The performances we achieved were higher than those obtained for the same classification tasks using classical statistical methods such as Discriminant Function Analysis. Further studies, investigating the reliability of these algorithms for the real-time classification of contact calls and comparing ANNs with other machine learning techniques are important to develop technology to remotely monitor the vocalisations of domestic livestock.

Accurate detection of de novo mutations from sequencing data is a critical step in triobased genetic studies. Existing bioinformatic approaches usually yield high error rates due to sequencing artifacts and alignment issues, which may either miss true de novo mutations or call too many false ones, making downstream validation and analysis difficult. In particular, current approaches have much worse specificity than sensitivity, and developing effective filters to discriminate genuine from spurious de novo mutations remains an unsolved challenge. Results: In this article, we curated 59 sequence features in whole genome and exome alignment context which are considered to be relevant to discriminating true de novo mutations from artifacts, and then employed a machine-learning approach to classify candidates as true or false de novo mutations. Specifically, we built a classifier, named De Novo Mutation Filter (DNMFilter), using gradient boosting as the classification algorithm. We built the training set using experimentally validated true and false de novo mutations as well as collected false de novo mutations from an in-house large-scale exomesequencing project. We evaluated DNMFilter's theoretical performance and investigated relative importance of different sequence features on the classification accuracy. Finally, we applied DNMFilter on our in-house whole exome trios and one CEU trio from the 1000 Genomes Project and found that DNMFilter could be coupled with commonly used de novo mutation detection approaches as an effective filtering approach to significantly reduce false discovery rate without sacrificing sensitivity.

Results: We implemented a supervised machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, in an automated workflow to identify N-glycopeptides using spectral features derived from ion trap-based LC-MS 2 data. The workflow streamlined high-confident N-glycopeptide spectral data and enabled adaptive model optimization with respect to different sampling strategies, training sample size and feature set. A critical evaluation of the features important for glycopeptide identification further facilitated effective feature selection for model improvement. Using split sample testing method from 577 high-confident N-glycopeptide spectral data, we demonstrated that an optimal true-positive rate, precision and false-positive rate of 73, 88 and 10%, respectively, can be attained for overall N-glycopeptide identification Availability and implementation: The workflow developed in this work and the application suite, Sweet-Heart, that the workflow supports for N-glycopeptide identification are available for download at http://sweet-heart. glycoproteomics. proteome. bc. sinica. edu. tw/.

Here we tested the role of predator removal on the contemporary evolution of prey traits such as movement, reproduction and foraging. We use EcoSim simulation which allows complex intra- and inter-specific interactions, based on individual evolving behavioral models, as well as complex predator-prey dynamics and coevolution in spatially homogenous and heterogeneous worlds. We model organisms' behavior using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) that are coded in their genomes which has a clear semantics making reasoning about causality of any evolved behavior possible. We show that the contemporary evolution of prey behavior owing to predator removal is also accompanied by prey genetic change. We employed machine learning methods, now recognized as holding great promise for the advancement of our understanding and prediction of ecological phenomena. A classification algorithm was used to demonstrate the difference between genomes belonging to prey coevolving with predators and prey evolving in the absence of predation pressure. We argue that predator introductions to naive prey might be destabilizing if prey have evolved and adapted to the absence of predators. Our results suggest that both predator introductions and predator removal from an ecosystem have widespread effects on the survival and evolution of prey by altering their genomes and behavior, even after relatively short time intervals. Our study highlights the need to consider both ecological and evolutionary time scales, as well as the complex interplay of behaviors between trophic levels, in determining the outcomes of predator-prey interactions.

The analyzed sample includes 117 adults (67 ADHD, 50 controls). The measurements are taken for four different conditions: two resting conditions (eyes open and eyes closed) and two neuropsychological tasks (visual continuous performance test and emotional continuous performance test). We divide the sample into four data sets, one for each condition. Each data set is used for training of four different support vector machine classifiers, while the output of classifiers is combined using logical expression derived from the Karnaugh map. The results show that this approach improves the discrimination between ADHD and control groups, as well as between ADHD subtypes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Haque, MM; Skinner, MK; Holder, LB				Haque, M. Muksitul; Skinner, Michael K.; Holder, Lawrence B.			Imbalanced Class Learning in Epigenetics	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						biology; computational molecular biology; DNA; genomics; machine earning	TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE; SPERM EPIMUTATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; DISEASE; DIFFERENTIATION; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; DISCOVERY; TARGETS	In machine learning, one of the important criteria for higher classification accuracy is a balanced dataset. Datasets with a large ratio between minority and majority classes face hindrance in learning using any classifier. Datasets having a magnitude difference in number of instances between the target concept result in an imbalanced class distribution. Such datasets can range from biological data, sensor data, medical diagnostics, or any other domain where labeling any instances of the minority class can be time-consuming or costly or the data may not be easily available. The current study investigates a number of imbalanced class algorithms for solving the imbalanced class distribution present in epigenetic datasets. Epigenetic (DNA methylation) datasets inherently come with few differentially DNA methylated regions (DMR) and with a higher number of non-DMR sites. For this class imbalance problem, a number of algorithms are compared, including the TAN+AdaBoost algorithm. Experiments performed on four epigenetic datasets and several known datasets show that an imbalanced dataset can have similar accuracy as a regular learner on a balanced dataset.	[Haque, M.

J	Zhou, XB; Jiang, CJ				Zhou, Xiaobo; Jiang, Chang-Jun			Autonomic Performance and Power Control on Virtualized Servers: Survey, Practices, and Trends	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						autonomic computing; joint performance and power control; virtualized server; Internet application; sustainable computing	TIER INTERNET APPLICATIONS; SCALE DATA CENTERS; ADMISSION CONTROL; WEB SERVERS; SYSTEMS	Modern datacenter servers hosting popular Internet services face significant and multi-facet challenges in performance and power control. The user-perceived performance is the result of a complex interaction of complex workloads in a very complex underlying system. Highly dynamic and bursty workloads of Internet services fluctuate over multiple time scales, which has a significant impact on processing and power demands of datacenter servers. High-density servers apply virtualization technology for capacity planning and system manageability. Such virtualized computer systems are increasingly large and complex. This paper surveys representative approaches to autonomic performance and power control on virtualized servers, which control the quality of service provided by virtualized resources, improve the energy efficiency of the underlying system, and reduce the burden of complex system management from human operators. It then presents three designed self-adaptive resource management techniques based on machine learning and control for percentile-based response time assurance, non-intrusive energy-efficient performance isolation, and joint performance and power guarantee on virtualized servers. The techniques were implemented and evaluated in a testbed of virtualized servers hosting benchmark applications. Finally, two research trends are identified and discussed for sustainable cloud computing in green datacenters.

Methods: We implemented an automated classifier relying on surface-based features of FCD morphology and intensity, taking advantage of their covariance. The method was tested on 19 patients (15 with histologically confirmed FCD) scanned at 3.0T, and cross-validated using a leave-one-out strategy. We assessed specificity in 24 healthy controls and 11 disease controls with temporal lobe epilepsy. Cross-dataset classification performance was evaluated in 20 healthy controls and 14 patients with histologically verified FCD examined at 1.5T. Results: Sensitivity was 74%, with 100% specificity (i.e., no lesions detected in healthy or disease controls). In 50% of cases, a single cluster colocalized with the FCD lesion, while in the remaining cases a median of 1 extralesional cluster was found. Applying the classifier (trained on 3.0T data) to the 1.5T dataset yielded comparable performance (sensitivity 71%, specificity 95%). Conclusion: In patients initially diagnosed as MRI-negative, our fully automated multivariate approach offered a substantial gain in sensitivity over standard radiologic assessment. The proposed method showed generalizability across cohorts, scanners, and field strengths. Machine learning may assist presurgical decision-making by facilitating hypothesis formulation about the epileptogenic zone. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that automated machine learning of MRI patterns accurately identifies FCD among patients with extratemporal epilepsy initially diagnosed as MRI-negative.

Recent large-scale chromatin states mapping efforts have revealed characteristic chromatin modification signatures for various types of functional DNA elements. The conclusions drew in these studies have promoted the emergence of a series of supervised and unsupervised methods of DNA elements identification, some of which have been successfully applied to identify functional DNA elements in a number of genomes and have become the regular tools to decode an unknown genome. These methods are adept at different aspects of genomic studies, varied by the embedded algorithms and the identification strategies. In most cases users should consider joint application of different types of methods to obtain a balance between identification sensitivity and specificity. Despite the successful applications of current methods, each type of methods has its own disadvantages which users should scrupulously avoid. In this paper, we not only reviewed the main types of previous and current DNA elements identification methods, and comprehensively analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each type of methods, but also pointed out the next possible directions of method improvement. We anticipated the analysis and views put forward in this review could help readers to deepen the understanding of principles of DNA elements identification methods, thus better applied them in their own studies.

The growth and vitality condition of mangroves may be negatively influenced by various anthropogenic and natural disturbances and stresses, such as cold weather events. This paper represents the first attempt to map the cold damage to mangroves in the tropical zone of Southern China using high resolution multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, the spatial distribution of severity level of cold damage to mangroves imposed by a rare blizzard in Southern China during early 2008 has been mapped and analyzed using IKONOS image. An object-oriented classification applied to the images achieved an overall accuracy of 90.9% for classifying mangroves into three categories: undamaged, damaged, and dead. Of the total 287.30 ha of mapped mangroves, approximately 51.1% were damaged or died due to the cold stress of the blizzard. These results have been verified by more recent WorldView-II images. Furthermore, we explored the associations between the cold damage severity level of mangroves and climate and landscape factors, including elevation, surface slope, aspect, wind direction and velocity, wind shadow effect, and tree height. The surface topographical variables are derived from the ASTER Global DEM. The analysis results suggest that wind direction, terrain topography, and proximity to ocean are important local environmental factors controlling the vulnerability of mangroves to cold damage. Most damaged mangroves were located near the open sea, as a result of a possible edge exposure effect. The damage to the mangroves on the leeward side of a hill was also minimal. Such knowledge of climate and landscape controls can offer insight on how to better restore and protect the mangrove forest in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

A cross-sectional examination of marketing of electronic cigarettes on Twitter	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Article							TOBACCO CONTROL	Background Rapid increases in marketing of e-cigarettes coincide with growth in e-cigarette use in recent years; however, little is known about how e-cigarettes are marketed on social media platforms. Methods Keywords were used to collect tweets related to e-cigarettes from the Twitter Firehose between 1 May 2012 and 30 June 2012. Tweets were coded for smoking cessation mentions, as well as health and safety mentions, and were classified as commercial or non-commercial ('organic') tweets using a combination of Naive Bayes machine learning methods, keyword algorithms and human coding. Metadata associated with each tweet were used to examine the characteristics of accounts tweeting about e-cigarettes. Results 73 672 tweets related to e-cigarettes were captured in the study period, 90% of which were classified as commercial tweets. Accounts tweeting commercial e-cigarette content were associated with lower Klout scores, a measure of influence. Commercial tweeting was largely driven by a small group of highly active accounts, and 94% of commercial tweets included links to websites, many of which sell or promote e-cigarettes. Approximately 10% of commercial and organic tweets mentioned smoking cessation, and 34% of commercial tweets included mentions of prices or discounts for e-cigarettes. Conclusions Twitter appears to be an important marketing platform for e-cigarettes. Tweets related to e-cigarettes were overwhelmingly commercial, and a substantial proportion mentioned smoking cessation. E-cigarette marketing on Twitter may have public health implications. Continued surveillance of e-cigarette marketing on social media platforms is needed.

Urban activity pattern classification using topic models from online geo-location data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Activity pattern classification; Activity-based modeling; Social computing; Location-based data; Big data; Social media; Topic modeling; Machine learning	TRAVEL-ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR; SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS; RECOGNITION	Location-based check-in services in various social media applications have enabled individuals to share their activity-related choices providing a new source of human activity data. Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users' weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Performance of an Automatic Arrhythmia Classification Algorithm: Comparison to the ALTITUDE Electrophysiologist Panel Adjudications	PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						defibrillators; ICD; CRT; database; computing; electrocardiogram	IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR; RECIPIENTS	Introduction: Adjudication of thousands of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)-treated arrhythmia episodes is labor intensive and, as a result, is most often left undone. The objective of this study was to evaluate an automatic classification algorithm for adjudication of ICD-treated arrhythmia episodes. Methods: The algorithm uses a machine learning algorithm and was developed using 776 arrhythmia episodes. The algorithm was validated on 131 dual-chamber ICD shock episodes from 127 patients adjudicated by seven electrophysiologists (EPs). Episodes were classified by panel consensus as ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) or non-VT/VF, with the resulting classifications used as the reference. Subsequently, each episode electrogram (EGM) data was randomly assigned to three EPs without the atrial lead information, and to three EPs with the atrial lead information. Those episodes were also classified by the automatic algorithm with and without atrial information. Agreement with the reference was compared between the three EPs consensus group and the algorithm. Results: The overall agreement with the reference was similar between three-EP consensus and the algorithm for both with atrial EGM (94% vs 95%, P = 0.87) and without atrial EGM (90% vs 91%, P = 0.91). The odds of accurate adjudication, after adjusting for covariates, did not significantly differ between the algorithm and EP consensus (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.06). Conclusions: This algorithm performs at a level comparable to an EP panel in the adjudication of arrhythmia episodes treated by both dual-and single-chamber ICDs. This type of algorithm has the potential for automated analysis of clinical ICD episodes, and adjudication of EGMs for research studies and quality analyses.

We applied both methods for the mapping of organic carbon (C-org) in riparian forests due to their considerably high carbon storage capacity. Despite the importance of floodplains for carbon sequestration, a sufficient scientific foundation for creating large-scale maps showing the spatial C-org distribution is still missing. We estimated organic carbon in a test site in the Danube Floodplain based on RapidEye remote sensing data and additional geodata. Accordingly, carbon distribution maps of vegetation, soil, and total C-org stocks were derived. Results were compared and statistically evaluated with terrestrial survey data for outcomes with pure remote sensing data and for the combination with additional geodata using bias and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show that SOM and kNN approaches enable us to reproduce spatial patterns of riparian forest C-org stocks. While vegetation C-org has very high RMSEs, outcomes for soil and total C-org stocks are less biased with a lower RMSE, especially when remote sensing and additional geodata are conjointly applied. SOMs show similar percentages of RMSE to kNN estimations.

The key novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) the use of spatio-temporal video slices (tomographs) in the same way that visual keyframes are typically used in video concept detection schemes. These spatio-temporal slices capture in a compact way motion patterns that are useful for detecting semantic concepts and are used for training a number of base detectors. The latter augment the set of keyframebased base detectors that can be trained using different frame representations. 2) The introduction of a generic methodology, built upon a genetic algorithm, for controlling which subset of the available base detectors (consequently, which subset of the possible shot representations) should be combined for developing an optimal detector for each specific concept. This methodology is directly applicable to the learning of hundreds of diverse concepts, while diverging from the one-size-fits-all approach that is typically used in problems of this size. The proposed techniques are evaluated on the datasets of the 2011 and 2012 Semantic Indexing Task of TRECVID, each comprising several hundred hours of heterogeneous video clips and ground-truth annotations for tens of concepts that exhibit significant variation in terms of generality, complexity, and human participation. The experimental results manifest the merit of the proposed techniques.

However, junk mail also, known as spam has increasingly become a part of life for users as well as internet service providers. To address this problem, many solutions have been proposed in the last decade. Currently, content-based anti-spam filtering methods are an important issue; the spam filtering is considered as a special case of binary text categorization. Many machine learning techniques have been developed and applied to classify email as spam or non-spam. In this paper, we proposed an enhanced K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) method called Cellular Automaton Combined with KNN (CA-KNN) for spam filtering. In our proposed method, a cellular automaton is used to identify which instances in training set should be selected to classify a new e-mail; CA-KNN selects the nearest neighbours not from the whole training set, but only from a reduced subset selected by a cellular automaton.

Face biometrics is noteworthy one because of its simple accessibility, easy usage and the ability of better acceptance by persons. The process of facial recognition includes these phases: Pre-processing of images, extracting important properties of the face, and finally, the classification of these properties. There are many researches carried out in this area, each of which employed different methods for mentioned phases. According to the previous applications of the methods, which have been done by artificial immune network, and to its relatively good results in optimization problems, machine learning, pattern recognition, data search, data clustering and so on, in this research facial verification through classification by artificial immune Network (aiNET) has been surveyed. In this article, databank Yale has been used and the statistical properties such as maximum, minimum, variance and energy of wavelet coefficients in different compositions have been examined. In order to validation, we have used the Cross Validation method that its best results in the case of using the ten-fold or leave one out method, were FAR=2.1 %, FRR=0.9%, and EER=1.8%.

Using Information from Historical High-Throughput Screens to Predict Active Compounds	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							SELECTION; FINGERPRINTS; SIMILARITY; MOLECULES; FUSION; DRUGS	Modern high-throughput screening (HTS) is a well-established approach for hit finding in drug discovery that is routinely employed in the pharmaceutical industry to screen more than a million compounds within a few weeks. However, as the industry shifts to more disease-relevant but more complex phenotypic screens, the focus has moved to piloting smaller but smarter chemically/biologically diverse subsets followed by an expansion around hit compounds. One standard method for doing this is to train a machine-learning (ML) model with the chemical fingerprints of the tested subset of molecules and then select the next compounds based on the predictions of this model. An alternative approach would be to take advantage of the wealth of bioactivity information contained in older (full-deck) screens using so-called HTS fingerprints, where each element of the fingerprint corresponds to the outcome of a particular assay, as input to machine-learning algorithms. We constructed HTS fingerprints using two collections of data: 93 in-house assays and 95 publicly available assays from Pub Chem. For each source, an additional set of 51 and 46 assays, respectively, was collected for testing. Three different ML methods, random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and naive Bayes (NB), were investigated for both the HTS fingerprint and a chemical fingerprint, Morgan2. RF was found to be best suited for learning from HTS fingerprints yielding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values >0.8 for 78% of the internal assays and enrichment factors at 5% (EF(5%)) >10 for 55% of the assays. The RF(HTS-fp) generally outperformed the LR trained with Morgan2, which was the best ML method for the chemical fingerprint, for the majority of assays. In addition, HTS fingerprints were found to retrieve more diverse chemotypes. Combining the two models through heterogeneous classifier fusion led to a similar or better performance than the best individual model for all assays. Further validation using a pair of in-house assays and data from a confirmatory screen including a prospective set of around 2000 compounds selected based on our approach confirmed the good performance. Thus, the combination of machine-learning with HTS fingerprints and chemical fingerprints utilizes information from both domains and presents a very promising approach for hit expansion, leading to more hits. The source code used with the public data is provided.

Enrichment of Chemical Libraries Docked to Protein Conformational Ensembles and Application to Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; EMPIRICAL SCORING FUNCTION; VIRTUAL SCREENING ENRICHMENTS; LIGAND INTERACTIONS; FORCE-FIELD; KINASE INHIBITORS; BINDING-AFFINITY; RECEPTOR FLEXIBILITY; FINGERPRINT METHODS; GENETIC ALGORITHM	Molecular recognition is a complex process that involves a large ensemble of structures of the receptor and ligand. Yet, most structure-based virtual screening is carried out on a single structure typically from X-ray crystallography. Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer an opportunity to sample multiple conformational states of a protein. Here we evaluate our recently developed scoring method SVMSP in its ability to enrich chemical libraries docked to MD structures of seven proteins from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). SVMSP is a target-specific rescoring method that combines machine learning with statistical potentials. We find that enrichment power as measured by the area under the ROC curve (ROC-AUC) is not affected by increasing the number of MD structures. Among individual MD snapshots, many exhibited enrichment that was significantly better than the crystal structure, but no correlation between enrichment and structural deviation from crystal structure was found. We followed an innovative approach by training SVMSP scoring models using MD structures (SVMSPMD). The resulting models were applied to two difficult cases (p38 and CDK2) for which enrichment was not better than random. We found remarkable increase in enrichment power, particularly for p38, where the ROC-AUC increased by 0.30 to 0.85. Finally, we explored approaches for a priori identification of MD snapshots with high enrichment power from an MD simulation in the absence of active compounds. We found that the use of randomly selected compounds docked to the target of interest using SVMSP led to notable enrichment for EGFR and Src MD snapshots. SVMSP rescoring of protein-compound MD structures was applied for the search of small-molecule inhibitors of the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). Rank-ordering of a commercial library of 50 000 compounds docked to MD structures of ALDH2 led to five small-molecule inhibitors. Four compounds had ICSOs below 5 mu M. These compounds serve as leads for the design and synthesis of more potent and selective ALDH2 inhibitors.

Fusing Single-Point and Dual-Event Dose Response Data for Mycobacterium tuberculosis	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							DRUG DISCOVERY; BAYESIAN MODELS; CHEMISTRY DATABASES; PHENOTYPIC SCREENS; LEAD OPTIMIZATION; BIOLOGY; METABOLISM; ABSORPTION; CANDIDATES; CHALLENGES	Tuberculosis is a major, neglected disease for which the quest to find new treatments continues. There is an abundance of data from large phenotypic screens in the public domain against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Since machine learning methods can learn from past data, we were interested in addressing whether more data builds better models. We now describe using Bayesian machine learning to assess whether we can improve our models by combining the large quantities of single-point data with the much smaller (higher quality) dual-event data sets, which use both dose response data for both whole-cell antitubercular activity and Vero cell cytotoxicity. We have evaluated 12 models ranging from different single-point, dual-event dose response, single-point and dual-event dose response as well as combined data sets for three distinct data sets from the same laboratory. We used a fourth data set of active and inactive compounds from the same group as well as a smaller set of 177 active compounds from GlaxoSmithKline as test sets. Our data suggest combining single-point with dual-event dose response data does not diminish the internal or external predictive ability of the models based on the receiver operator curve (ROC) for these models (internal ROC range 0.83-0.91, external ROC range 0.62-0.83) compared to the orders of magnitude smaller dual-event models (internal ROC range 0.6-0.83 and external ROC 0.54-0.83). In conclusion, models developed with 1200-5000 compounds appear to be as predictive as those generated with 25 000-350 000 molecules. Our results have implications for justifying further high-throughput screening versus focused testing based on model predictions.

Spherical tensor multipolar electrostatics and smooth particle mesh Ewald summation: a theoretical study	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING			English	Article						Force field; Molecular dynamics; Multipole moments; Electrostatics; Ewald summation; Spherical harmonics; Smooth particle mesh Ewald	MOLECULAR CHARGE-DISTRIBUTION; BIOMOLECULAR SIMULATIONS; LIQUID WATER; PERSPECTIVE; POTENTIALS; ATOMS; FIELD; CONVERGENCE; EXPANSION; DYNAMICS	The point-charge approximation, typically used by classical molecular mechanics force-fields, can be overcome by a multipolar expansion. For decades multipole moments were only used in the context of the rigid body approximation but recently it has become possible to combine multipolar electrostatics with molecular flexibility. The program DL_MULTI, which is derived from DL_POLY_2, includes efficient multipolar Ewald functionality up to the hexadecapole moment but the code is restricted to rigid bodies. The incorporation of flexibility into DL_MULTI would cause too large an impact on its architecture whereas the package DL_POLY_4 offers a more attractive and sustainable route to handle multipolar electrostatics. This package inherently handles molecular flexibility, which warrants sufficiently transferable atoms or atoms that are "knowledgeable" about their chemical environment (as made possible by quantum chemical topology and machine learning). DL_MULTI uses the spherical multipole formalism, which is mathematically more involved than the Cartesian one but which is more compact. DL_POLY_4 uses the computationally efficient method of smooth particle mesh Ewald (SPME) summation, which has also been parallellized by others. Therefore, combining the strengths of DL_POLY_4 and DL_MULTI poses the challenge of merging SPME with multipolar electrostatics by spherical multipole. In an effort to recast as clearly as possible the principles behind DL_MULTI, its key equations have been reformulated by the more streamlined route involving the algebra of complex numbers, and some of these equations' peculiarities clarified. This article explores theoretically the repercussions of the merging of SPME with spherical multipole electrostatics (as implemented in DL_MULTI). Difficulties in design and implementation of possible future code are discussed.	[Zielinski, Francois; Popelier, Paul L.

However, functional and structural MRI data reveal a multivariate nature, since neighboring voxels are highly correlated and different localized brain regions activate interdependently. Multivariate pattern classification techniques are capable of overcoming shortcomings of univariate statistics. A rising interest in such approaches on neuroimaging data leads to an increasing demand of appropriate software and tools in this field. Here, we introduce and release MANIA-Machine learning Application for NeuroImaging Analyses. MANIA is a Matlab based software toolbox enabling easy pattern classification of neuroimaging data and offering a broad assortment of machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods. Between groups classifications are the main scope of this software, for instance the differentiation between patients and controls. A special emphasis was placed on an intuitive and easy to use graphical user interface allowing quick implementation and guidance also for clinically oriented researchers. MANIA is free and open source, published under GPL3 license. This work will give an overview regarding the functionality and the modular software architecture as well as a comparison between other software packages.

Here, we report the availability of LocTree3 as a public web server. The server includes the machine learning-based LocTree2 and improves over it through the addition of homology-based inference. Assessed on sequence-unique data, LocTree3 reached an 18-state accuracy Q18 = 80 +/- 3% for eukaryotes and a six-state accuracy Q6 = 89 +/- 4% for bacteria. The server accepts submissions ranging from single protein sequences to entire proteomes. Response time of the unloaded server is about 90 s for a 300-residue eukaryotic protein and a few hours for an entire eukaryotic proteome not considering the generation of the alignments. For over 1000 entirely sequenced organisms, the predictions are directly available as downloads. The web server is available at http://www.rostlab.org/services/loctree3.

NPs act by activating signaling cascades governing broad functions such as metabolism, sensation and behavior throughout the animal kingdom. NPs are the products of multistep processing of longer proteins, the NP precursors (NPPs). We present NeuroPID (Neuropeptide Precursor Identifier), an online machine-learning tool that identifies metazoan NPPs. NeuroPID was trained on 1418 NPPs annotated as such by UniProtKB. A large number of sequence-based features were extracted for each sequence with the goal of capturing the biophysical and informational-statistical properties that distinguish NPPs from other proteins. Training several machine-learning models, including support vector machines and ensemble decision trees, led to high accuracy (89-94%) and precision (90-93%) in cross-validation tests. For inputs of thousands of unseen sequences, the tool provides a ranked list of high quality predictions based on the results of four machine-learning classifiers. The output reveals many uncharacterized NPPs and secreted cell modulators that are rich in potential cleavage sites. NeuroPID is a discovery and a prediction tool that can be used to identify NPPs from unannotated transcriptomes and mass spectrometry experiments. NeuroPID predicted sequences are attractive targets for investigating behavior, physiology and cell modulation. The NeuroPID web tool is available at http:// neuropid.cs.huji.ac.il.

ToppMiR: ranking microRNAs and their mRNA targets based on biological functions and context	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							CANDIDATE GENE PRIORITIZATION; ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS; EXPRESSION; MIRNA; ENVIRONMENT; NETWORKS; RESOURCE; DATABASE; BODYMAP; SITES	Identifying functionally significant microRNAs (miRs) and their correspondingly most important messenger RNA targets (mRNAs) in specific biological contexts is a critical task to improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying organismal development, physiology and disease. However, current miR-mRNA target prediction platforms rank miR targets based on estimated strength of physical interactions and lack the ability to rank interactants as a function of their potential to impact a given biological system. To address this, we have developed ToppMiR (http://toppmir.cchmc.org), a web-based analytical workbench that allows miRs and mRNAs to be co-analyzed via biologically centered approaches in which gene function associated annotations are used to train a machine learning-based analysis engine. ToppMiR learns about biological contexts based on gene associated information from expression data or from a user-specified set of genes that relate to context-relevant knowledge or hypotheses. Within the biological framework established by the genes in the training set, its associated information content is then used to calculate a features association matrix composed of biological functions, protein interactions and other features. This scoring matrix is then used to jointly rank both the test/candidate miRs and mRNAs. Results of these analyses are provided as downloadable tables or network file formats usable in Cytoscape.

The originality of DINIES lies in prediction with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, in the integration of heterogeneous biological data and in compatibility with the KEGG database. The DINIES server accepts any 'profiles' or precalculated similarity matrices (or 'kernels') of drugs and target proteins in tab-delimited file format. When a training data set is submitted to learn a predictive model, users can select either known interaction information in the KEGG DRUG database or their own interaction data. The user can also select an algorithm for supervised network inference, select various parameters in the method and specify weights for heterogeneous data integration. The server can provide integrative analyses with useful components in KEGG, such as biological pathways, functional hierarchy and human diseases.

For example, in recent years, representations based on both phonotactic and acoustic features have proven their effectiveness for LID. Although advances in machine learning have led to significant improvements, LID performance is still lacking, especially for short duration speech utterances. With the hypothesis that language information is weak and represented only latently in speech, and is largely dependent on the statistical properties of the speech content, existing representations may be insufficient. Furthermore they may be susceptible to the variations caused by different speakers, specific content of the speech segments, and background noise. To address this, we propose using Deep Bottleneck Features (DBF) for spoken LID, motivated by the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in speech recognition. We show that DBFs can form a low-dimensional compact representation of the original inputs with a powerful descriptive and discriminative capability. To evaluate the effectiveness of this, we design two acoustic models, termed DBF-TV and parallel DBF-TV (PDBF-TV), using a DBF based i-vector representation for each speech utterance. Results on NIST language recognition evaluation 2009 (LRE09) show significant improvements over state-of-the-art systems. By fusing the output of phonotactic and acoustic approaches, we achieve an EER of 1.08%, 1.89% and 7.01% for 30 s, 10 s and 3 s test utterances respectively. Furthermore, various DBF configurations have been extensively evaluated, and an optimal system proposed.

We use hybrid classification-regression forests to learn how to map from near infrared intensity images to absolute, metric depth in real-time. We demonstrate a variety of human-computer interaction and capture scenarios. Experiments show an accuracy that outperforms a conventional light fall-off baseline, and is comparable to high-quality consumer depth cameras, but with a dramatically reduced cost, power consumption, and form-factor.

It is recently demonstrated that differences in the acute phase of the LLR, also known as the visual motor response (VMR), can be utilized to evaluate new eye drugs. However, most of the previous studies focused on the average LLR activity of a particular genotype, which left information that could address differences in individual zebrafish development unattended. In this study, machine learning techniques were employed to distinguish not only zebrafish larvae of different genotypes, but also different batches, based on their response to light stimuli. This approach allows us to perform efficient high-throughput zebrafish screening with relatively simple preparations. Following the general machine learning framework, some discriminative features were first extracted from the behavioral data. Both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms were implemented for the classification of zebrafish of different genotypes and batches. The accuracy of the classification in genotype was over 80 percent and could achieve up to 95 percent in some cases. The results obtained shed light on the potential of using machine learning techniques for analyzing behavioral data of zebrafish, which may enhance the reliability of high-throughput drug screening.

Although more genome-sequence data are becoming available, a large fraction of it remains functionally uncharacterized. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the mapping of poorly annotated proteins to original pathway models. Results: We have developed a Relational Learning-based Extension (RLE) system to investigate pathway membership through a function prediction approach that mainly relies on combinations of simple properties attributed to each protein. RLE searches for proteins with molecular similarities to specific pathway components. Using RLE, we associated 383 uncharacterized proteins to 28 pre-defined human Reactome pathways, demonstrating relative confidence after proper evaluation. Indeed, in specific cases manual inspection of the database annotations and the related literature supported the proposed classifications. Examples of possible additional components of the Electron transport system, Telomere maintenance and Integrin cell surface interactions pathways are discussed in detail.

Many machine learning methods have been used to construct classifiers based on mass spectrometry data, for discrimination between cancer stages. However, the classifiers generated by machine learning such as SVM techniques typically lack biological interpretability. We present an innovative technique for automated discovery of signatures optimized to characterize various cancer stages. We validate our signature discovery algorithm on one new colorectal cancer MALDI-TOF data set, and two well-known ovarian cancer SELDI-TOF data sets. In all of these cases, our signature based classifiers performed either better or at least as well as four benchmark machine learning algorithms including SVM and KNN.

Gait events were detected using a uniaxial gyro that measured the foot instep angular velocity in the sagittal plane to feed a four-state left-right hidden Markov model (HMM). The short-time Viterbi algorithm was used to overcome the limitation of the standard Viterbi algorithm, which does not allow the online decoding of hidden state sequences. Supervised learning of the HMM structure and validation with the leave-one-subject-out validation method were performed using treadmill gait reference data from an optical motion capture system. The four gait events were foot strike, flat foot (FF), heel off (HO), and toe off. The accuracy ranged, on average, from 45 ms (early detection, FF) to 35 ms (late detection, HO); the latency of detection was less than 100 ms for all gait events but the HO, where the probability that it was greater than 100 ms was 25%. Overground walking tests of the HMM-based gait event detector were also successfully performed.

Most current systems require sensors which intrusively touch the user's skin. Recent advances in contact-free physiological signals open the door to many new types of applications. This technology promises to measure heart rate (HR) and respiration using video only. The effectiveness of this technology, its limitations, and ways of overcoming them deserves particular attention. In this paper, we evaluate this technique for measuring HR in a controlled situation, in a naturalistic computer interaction session, and in an exercise situation. For comparison, HR was measured simultaneously using an electrocardiography device during all sessions. The results replicated the published results in controlled situations, but show that they cannot yet be considered as a valid measure of HR in naturalistic human-computer interaction. We propose a machine learning approach to improve the accuracy of HR detection in naturalistic measurements. The results demonstrate that the root mean squared error is reduced from 43.76 to 3.64 beats/min using the proposed method.

Its diagnosis can be achieved by analyzing the interference patterns of the tear film lipid layer and by classifying them into one of the Guillon categories. The manual process done by experts is not only affected by subjective factors but is also very time consuming. In this paper we propose a general methodology to the automatic classification of tear film lipid layer, using color and texture information to characterize the image and feature selection methods to reduce the processing time. The adequacy of the proposed methodology was demonstrated since it achieves classification rates over 97% while maintaining robustness and provides unbiased results. Also, it can be applied in real time, and so allows important time savings for the experts.

Swarm-based models consider knowledge entities as particles that move in the space to reach the higher quality. Fuzzy Systems following SI-PSO for knowledge acquisition are categorized in this work as Swarm Fuzzy Systems (SFSs). Specifically, two learning methodologies, KASIA (using rule bases as particles in PSO) and KARP (using rules as particles in PSO) are introduced. SFSs performance is studied in a problem of practical importance nowadays with data sets, the learning of fuzzy meta-schedulers in computational grids. Fuzzy meta-schedulers are Fuzzy Systems doing intelligent allocation of jobs to improve the performance of the grid, such as the reduction of the execution time of workload. The scheduling decisions are taken based on the knowledge of the Fuzzy System and in this way, the relevance of their learning process are critical. In this work, compared results of the performance of the different SFSs and a comparison between SFSs and Genetic Fuzzy Systems are presented. Simulations results show that SFSs can achieve a faster convergence and higher quality with a reduced number of control parameters what makes them a good alternative to Genetic Fuzzy Systems.

The problem is exacerbated by the difficulty of selecting the proper modulation and coding scheme when using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper presents a data-driven approach to link adaptation for multiuser multiple input mulitple output (MIMO) OFDM systems. A machine learning classifier is used to select the modulation and coding scheme, taking as input the SNR values in the different subcarriers and spatial streams. A new approximation is developed to estimate the unknown interuser interference due to the use of limited feedback. This approximation allows to obtain SNR information at the transmitter with a minimum communication overhead. A greedy algorithm is used to perform spatial mode and user selection with affordable complexity, without resorting to an exhaustive search. The proposed adaptation is studied in the context of the IEEE 802.11ac standard, and is shown to schedule users and adjust the transmission parameters to the channel conditions as well as to the rate of the feedback channel.

We used a machine learning approach, gradient boosting machine (GBM) modeling, to determine whether the comorbid conditions present at the time of fracture and those that arose subsequently could, in aggregate, identify patients at the greatest increased risk of death. During 21,867 person-years of follow-up, 1245 deaths were observed when 1061 were expected (standardized mortality ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.2). Patients presented with a median history of 26 comorbid conditions each as assessed by the Clinical Classification Software system and 57 each over the total duration of follow-up. Using all available information, the excess deaths could be predicted with good accuracy (c-index >= 0.80) in 89% of the GBM models built for patients with different types of fracture; in one-third of the models, the c-index was >= 0.90. The conditions most prominent in the GBM prediction models were also reflected in the specific causes of death that were elevated, suggesting the influence of confounding on the relationship. However, the predominant comorbid conditions were mainly those responsible for mortality in the general population, rather than the specific diseases most closely associated with secondary osteoporosis. To reduce long-term deaths in the fracture population as a whole, a more general approach to the fracture patient is indicated. (C) 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.	[Melton, L.

We evaluated five advanced regression algorithms combined with synthetically mixed training data for quantifying urban land cover from HyMap data at 3.6 and 9 m spatial resolution. Methods included support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), artificial neural networks (NN), random forest regression (RFR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Our experiments demonstrate that both kernel methods SVR and KRR yield high accuracies for mapping complex urban surface types, i.e., rooftops, pavements, grass-and tree-covered areas. SVR and KRR models proved to be stable with regard to the spatial and spectral differences between both images and effectively utilized the higher complexity of the synthetic training mixtures for improving estimates for coarser resolution data. Observed deficiencies mainly relate to known problems arising from spectral similarities or shadowing. The remaining regressors either revealed erratic (NN) or limited (RFR and PLSR) performances when comprehensively mapping urban land cover. Our findings suggest that the combination of kernel-based regression methods, such as SVR and KRR, with synthetically mixed training data is well suited for quantifying urban land cover from imaging spectrometer data at multiple scales.

Spatial distribution models for this species traditionally employ either climatic data or remotely sensed data, or a combination of both. Until now, however, no studies compared the accuracies of C. imicola distribution models based on climatic versus remote sensing data, even though remotely sensed datasets may offer advantages over climatic datasets with respect to spatial and temporal resolution. This study performs such an analysis for datasets over the peninsula of Calabria, Italy. Spatial distribution modelling based on climatic data using the random forests machine learning technique resulted in a percentage of correctly classified C. imicola trapping sites of nearly 88%, thereby outperforming the linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression modelling techniques. When replacing climatic data by remote sensing data, random forests modelling accuracies decreased only slightly. Assessment of the different variables' importance showed that precipitation during late spring was the most important amongst 48 climatic variables. The dominant remotely sensed variables could be linked to climatic variables. Notwithstanding the slight decrease in predictive performance in this study, remotely sensed datasets could be preferred over climatic datasets for the modelling of C. imicola. Unlike climatic observations, remote sensing provides an equally high spatial resolution globally. Additionally, its high temporal resolution allows for investigating changes in species' presence and changing environment.	[Van Doninck, Jasper; Verhoest, Niko E.

Until now, several studies have been conducted to estimate fruit yield using image-processing technologies. However, most of these techniques require thresholds for features such as color, shape and size. In addition, their performance strongly depends on the thresholds used, although optimal thresholds tend to vary with images. Furthermore, most of these techniques have attempted to detect only mature and immature fruits, although the number of young fruits is more important for the prediction of long-term fluctuations in yield. In this study, we aimed to develop a method to accurately detect individual intact tomato fruits including mature, immature and young fruits on a plant using a conventional RGB digital camera in conjunction with machine learning approaches. The developed method did not require an adjustment of threshold values for fruit detection from each image because image segmentation was conducted based on classification models generated in accordance with the color, shape, texture and size of the images. The results of fruit detection in the test images showed that the developed method achieved a recall of 0.80, while the precision was 0.88. The recall values of mature, immature and young fruits were 1.00, 0.80 and 0.78, respectively.

More than one-third of home-dwelling people aged 65 or above and two-thirds of those in residential care fall once or more each year. Reliable fall detection, as well as prevention, is an important research topic for monitoring elderly living alone in residential or hospital units. The aim of this study is to review the existing fall detection systems and some of the key research challenges faced by the research community in this field. We categorize the existing platforms into two groups: wearable and ambient devices; the classification methods are divided into rule-based and machine learning techniques. The relative merit and potential drawbacks are discussed, and we also outline some of the outstanding research challenges that emerging new platforms need to address.

J	Dackermann, U; Skinner, B; Li, JC				Dackermann, Ulrike; Skinner, Bradley; Li, Jianchun			Guided wave-based condition assessment of in situ timber utility poles using machine learning algorithms	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Structural health monitoring; non-destructive testing; timber poles; machine learning; support vector machine; guided waves		This paper presents a machine-learning-based approach for the structural health monitoring (SHM) of in-situ timber utility poles based on guided wave (GW) propagation. The proposed non-destructive testing method combines a new multi-sensor testing system with advanced statistical signal processing techniques and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for the condition assessment of timber utility poles. Currently used pole inspection techniques have critical limitations including the inability to assess the underground section. GW methods, on the other hand, are techniques potentially capable of evaluating non-accessible areas and of detecting internal damage. However, due to the lack of solid understanding on the GW propagation in timber poles, most methods fail to fully interpret wave patterns from field measurements. The proposed method utilises an innovative multi-sensor testing system that captures wave signals along a sensor array and it applies machine learning algorithms to evaluate the soundness of a pole. To validate the new method, it was tested on eight in-situ timber poles. After the testing, the poles were dismembered to determine their actual health states. Various state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with advanced data pre-processing were applied to classify the poles based on the wave measurements. It was found that using a support vector machine classifier, with the GW signals transformed into autoregressive coefficients, achieved a very promising maximum classification accuracy of 95.7 +/- 3.1% using 10-fold cross validation on multiple training and testing instances. Using leave-one-out cross validation, a classification accuracy of 93.3 +/- 6.0% for bending wave and 85.7 +/- 10.8% for longitudinal wave excitation was achieved.

This work is part of the efforts which have applied structural health monitoring to the Sydney Harbour Bridge - one of Australia's iconic structures. It combines dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition techniques to accurately and efficiently distinguish faulty components from well-functioning ones. Specifically, random projection is used for dimensionality reduction on the vibration feature data. Then, healthy and damaged patterns of bridge components are learned in the lower dimensional projected space using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, namely, support vector machine and one-class support vector machine. The experimental results using data from a laboratory-based building structure and the Sydney Harbour Bridge showed high feasibility of applying machine learning techniques to dimensionality reduction and damage detection in structural health monitoring. Random projection combined with support vector machine significantly reduces the computational time while maintaining the detection accuracy. The proposed method also outperformed popular dimensionality reduction techniques. The computational time of the method using random projection can be more than 200 times faster than that without using dimensionality reduction while still achieving similar detection accuracy.

A parieto-frontal network (the mirror neuron system) matches visually presented biological motion information onto observers' motor representations. This process of matching the actions of others onto our own sensorimotor repertoire is thought to be important for action recognition, providing a non-mediated "motor perception" based on a bidirectional flow of information along the mirror parieto-frontal circuits. State-of-the-art machine learning strategies for hand action identification have shown better performances when sensorimotor data, as opposed to visual information only, are available during learning. As speech is a particular type of action (with acoustic targets), it is expected to activate a mirror neuron mechanism. Indeed, in speech perception, motor centers have been shown to be causally involved in the discrimination of speech sounds. In this paper, we review recent neurophysiological and machine learning-based studies showing (a) the specific contribution of the motor system to speech perception and (b) that automatic phone recognition is significantly improved when motor data are used during training of classifiers (as opposed to learning from purely auditory data).

Although genome-wide association studies have discovered thousands of well-replicated polymorphisms associated with a broad spectrum of complex traits, the combined predictive power of these associations for any given trait is generally too low to be of clinical relevance. We propose a novel systems approach to complex trait prediction, which leverages and integrates similarity in genetic, transcriptomic, or other omics-level data. We translate the omic similarity into phenotypic similarity using a method called Kriging, commonly used in geostatistics and machine learning. Our method called OmicKriging emphasizes the use of a wide variety of systems-level data, such as those increasingly made available by comprehensive surveys of the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, for complex trait prediction. Furthermore, our OmicKriging framework allows easy integration of prior information on the function of subsets of omics-level data from heterogeneous sources without the sometimes heavy computational burden of Bayesian approaches. Using seven disease datasets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), we show that OmicKriging allows simple integration of sparse and highly polygenic components yielding comparable performance at a fraction of the computing time of a recently published Bayesian sparse linear mixed model method. Using a cellular growth phenotype, we show that integrating mRNA and microRNA expression data substantially increases performance over either dataset alone. Using clinical statin response, we show improved prediction over existing methods. We provide an R package to implement OmicKriging (http://www.scandb.org/newinterface/tools/OmicKriging.html).

Aims: The aim is to discover novel noninvasive specific serum biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of HBV-related HCC and LC. Methods: With a highly optimized peptide extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometric approach, we investigated serum peptide profiles of 80 HCC and 67 LC patients. Three supervised machine learning methods were employed to construct classifiers. Receiver operator curves were plotted to evaluate the performance of classifiers. Results: With a support vector machine-based strategy, we picked nine peaks with m/z ratios of 819.49, 1076.14, 1341.72, 2551.44, 3156.44, 3812.88, 4184.26, 4465.92, and 4776.41 to construct the classifier. We proposed a novel method for distinguishing HCC from cirrhosis, based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) method. We obtained a sensitivity of 90.0%, specificity of 79.4%, and overall accuracy of 85.1% on an independent test set. The combination of the MLP model and serum AFP level outperformed serum AFP marker alone in distinguishing HCC patients from LC patients. In this experience, sensitivity increased from 62.5% to 87.5%, and specificity increased from 79.4% to 88.2%. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the MLP model is a novel and useful serum peptide pattern for distinguishing HCC and LC. The peptidome signature alone or together with serum AFP determination may be a more effective method for early diagnosis of HCC in patients with HBV-related LC.

Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ALGORITHM; BOSON; NETS; LHC	Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine-learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on 'shallow' machine-learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions of the inputs, and rely on a painstaking search through manually constructed nonlinear features. Progress on this problem has slowed, as a variety of techniques have shown equivalent performance. Recent advances in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions and better discriminate between signal and background classes. Here, using benchmark data sets, we show that deep-learning methods need no manually constructed inputs and yet improve the classification metric by as much as 8% over the best current approaches. This demonstrates that deep-learning approaches can improve the power of collider searches for exotic particles.

Chrysanthemum morifolium as herbs has a long planting history in China, culturing high quality ones and different varieties. Different chrysanthemum varieties differ in quality, chemical composition, functions, and application. Therefore, chrysanthemum varieties in the market demands precise identification to provide reference for reasonable and correct application as genuine medicinal material. Materials and Methods: A total of 244 batches of chrysanthemum samples were randomly divided into calibration set (160 batches) and prediction set (84 batches). The near infrared diffuses reflectance spectra of chrysanthemum varieties were preprocessed by first order derivative (D1) and autoscaling and was built model with partial least squares (PLS). Results: In this study of four chrysanthemum varieties identification, the accuracy rates in calibration sets of Boju, Chuju, Hangju, and Gongju are respectively 100, 100, 98.65, and 96.67%; while the accuracy rates in prediction sets are 100% except for 99.1% of Hangju. Conclusion: The research results demonstrate that the qualitative analysis can be conducted by machine learning combined with near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), which provides a new method for rapid and noninvasive identification of chrysanthemum varieties.

The hypothesis underlying this approach is that cancers have characteristic biochemical fingerprints that can be captured using spectroscopy. To relate complex multivariate spectra to disease state, machine-learning methods are typically used to recognize diagnostic spectral patterns. This article provides an extensive review of this field. The average diagnostic performance of the reviewed studies is impressive (>90% sensitivity and specificity) but most studies were small (<40 samples). Furthermore, diagnostic performance has often been calculated using methods now known to be overoptimistic. We conclude that, if the combination of spectroscopy and machine learning is to translate into clinical pract ice, larger studies are needed and researchers should routinely provide spectral data in support of their publications so that the data can be reanalyzed by other groups.

Such contests offer an opportunity to bring the excitement and challenges of protocol design-one of the core intellectual elements of research and practice in networked systems-to a broader group of potential contributors, whose ideas may prove important. Moreover, it may lead to an increase in the number of students, especially undergraduates or those learning via online courses, interested in pursuing a career in the field. We describe the creation of the infrastructure and our experience with a protocol design contest conducted in MIT's graduate Computer Networks class. This contest involved the design and evaluation of a congestion-control protocol for paths traversing cellular wireless networks. One key to the success of a design contest is an unambiguous, measurable objective to compare protocols. In practice, protocol design is the art of trading off conflicting goals with each other, but in this contest, we specified that the goal was to maximize log (throughput = delay). This goal is a good match for applications such as video streaming or videoconferencing that care about high throughput and low interactive delays. Some students produced protocols whose performance was better than published protocols tackling similar goals. Furthermore, the convex hull of the set of all student protocols traced out a trade-off curve in the throughput-delay space, providing useful insights into the entire space of possible protocols. We found that student protocols diverged in performance between the training and testing traces, indicating that some students had overtrained ("overfitted") their protocols to the training trace. Our conclusion is that, if designed properly, such contests could benefit networking research by making new proposals more easily reproducible and amenable to such "gamification," improve networked systems, and provide an avenue for outreach.

Applications of TAS range from online self-optimization of in-production applications to the automatic generation of QoS/cost-driven elastic scaling policies, as well as to support for what-if analysis on the scalability of transactional applications. In this article, we present the key innovation at the core of TAS, namely, a novel performance forecasting methodology that relies on the joint usage of analytical modeling and machine learning. By exploiting these two classically competing approaches in a synergic fashion, TAS achieves the best of the two worlds, namely, high extrapolation power and good accuracy, even when faced with complex workloads deployed over public cloud infrastructures. We demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of TAS's performance forecasting methodology via an extensive experimental study based on a fully fledged prototype implementation integrated with a popular open-source in-memory transactional data grid (Red Hat's Infinispan) and industry-standard benchmarks generating a breadth of heterogeneous workloads.

Functionally diverse dendritic mRNAs rapidly associate with ribosomes following a novel experience	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							LOCAL PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; TRANSLATIONAL PROFILING APPROACH; MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN; LARGE GENE LISTS; CNS CELL-TYPES; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXPRESSION	The subcellular localization and translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) supports functional differentiation between cellular compartments. In neuronal dendrites, local translation of mRNA provides a rapid and specific mechanism for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and might be involved in the pathophysiology of certain brain disorders. Despite the importance of dendritic mRNA translation, little is known about which mRNAs can be translated in dendrites in vivo and when their translation occurs. Here we collect ribosome-bound mRNA from the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus. We find that dendritic mRNA rapidly associates with ribosomes following a novel experience consisting of a contextual fear conditioning trial. High throughput RNA sequencing followed by machine learning classification reveals an unexpected breadth of ribosome-bound dendritic mRNAs, including mRNAs expected to be entirely somatic. Our findings are in agreement with a mechanism of synaptic plasticity that engages the acute local translation of functionally diverse dendritic mRNAs.

One of the most used method is digital mammography in medical diagnosis for breast cancer. Mammogram images are important for detecting breast cancer in early stages. Scientiests works on computer aided detection systems for developing second reader systems for radiologists and for reducing detection and diagnose error rates. The complexity and difficulty of microcalcification detection is one of the initial problem in mamogram analysis. In this paper, it is proposed a new feature extraction method called multi-window based statiscal analysis (MWBSA) for detection of microcilcification clusters which are early signs of breast cancer and two stage software framework as a computer aided detection and diagnosis system is proposed. The artifical neural network (ANN) is used as a classifier. Results show that multi window based approach is as applicable as other well known methos (GLCM and Wavelet) and also the computer detection system is applicable as a second reader. As a result of the ROC analysis high sensitivity values 1,00 by using MIAS database is obtained.

J	Kremer, J; Pedersen, KS; Igel, C				Kremer, Jan; Pedersen, Kim Steenstrup; Igel, Christian			Active learning with support vector machines	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Review							TEXT CLASSIFICATION; ONLINE	In machine learning, active learning refers to algorithms that autonomously select the data points from which they will learn. There are many data mining applications in which large amounts of unlabeled data are readily available, but labels (e. g., human annotations or results coming from complex experiments) are costly to obtain. In such scenarios, an active learning algorithm aims at identifying data points that, if labeled and used for training, would most improve the learned model. Labels are then obtained only for the most promising data points. This speeds up learning and reduces labeling costs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are particularly well-suited for active learning due to their convenient mathematical properties. They perform linear classification, typically in a kernel-induced feature space, which makes expressing the distance of a data point from the decision boundary straightforward. Furthermore, heuristics can efficiently help estimate how strongly learning from a data point influences the current model. This information can be used to actively select training samples. After a brief introduction to the active learning problem, we discuss different query strategies for selecting informative data points and review how these strategies give rise to different variants of active learning with SVMs. (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Treatment outcomes are determined by complex interactions between cancer genetics, treatment regimens, and patient-related variables. A key component of modern radiation oncology research is to predict at the time of treatment planning or during the course of fractionated radiation treatment, the probability of tumor eradication and normal tissue risks for the type of treatment being considered for the individual patient. A typical radiotherapy treatment scenario can generate a large pool of panomics data that may comprise 3D/4D anatomical and functional imaging information (noted as radiomics), in addition to biological markers (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) derived from peripheral blood and tissue specimens. Radiotherapy data informatics constitutes a unique interface between physical and biological processes. It can benefit from the general advances in biomedical informatics research while still requires the development of its own technologies within this framework to address specific issues related to its unique physics-biology interface. We review recent advances and discuss current challenges to interrogate panomics data in radiotherapy using bioinformatics tools for data aggregation, sharing, visualization, and outcomes modeling. We provide examples based on our and others experiences using systems radiobiology and machine learning to develop predictive models of outcomes in radiotherapy. We also highlight the potential opportunities in this field for evidence-based personalized medicine research for bioinformaticians and clinical decision-makers. (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It is typically not possible to write a single application that can run efficiently in different environments, leading to multiple versions and increased complexity. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are a promising avenue to enable programmers to use high-level abstractions and still achieve good performance on a variety of hardware. This is possible because DSLs have higher-level semantics and restrictions than general-purpose languages, so DSL compilers can perform higher-level optimization and translation. However, the cost of developing performance-oriented DSLs is a substantial roadblock to their development and adoption. In this article, we present an overview of the Delite compiler framework and the DSLs that have been developed with it. Delite simplifies the process of DSL development by providing common components, like parallel patterns, optimizations, and code generators, that can be reused in DSL implementations. Delite DSLs are embedded in Scala, a general-purpose programming language, but use metaprogramming to construct an Intermediate Representation (IR) of user programs and compile to multiple languages (including C++, CUDA, and OpenCL). DSL programs are automatically parallelized and different parts of the application can run simultaneously on CPUs and GPUs. We present Delite DSLs for machine learning, data querying, graph analysis, and scientific computing and show that they all achieve performance competitive to or exceeding C++ code.

These monitoring tasks provide insight into relevant biogeochemical processes as well as anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) enable scientists to nondestructively identify structural and biophysical characteristics of forests. This study quantified forest biomass and carbon stock at the plot level from small-footprint full-waveform LiDAR data collected over a montane mixed forest in September 2011, using seven modeling methods: ordinary least squares, generalized additive model, Cubist, bagging, random forest, boosted regression trees, and support vector regression (SVR). Results showed that higher percentiles of canopy height and intensity made significant contributions to the predictions, while other explanatory variables related to canopy geometric volume, structure, and canopy coverage were generally not as important. Boosted regression trees provided the highest accuracy for model calibration, whereas SVR and ordinary least squares performed slightly better than the other models in model validation. In this study, the simple ordinary least squares approach performed just as well as any advanced machine learning method.

The Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) ESO Public Survey is a variability survey of the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the disk carried out from 2010 on ESO Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA). The VVV survey will eventually deliver a deep near-IR atlas with photometry and positions in five passbands (ZYJHK(s)) and a catalogue of 1-10 million variable point sources - mostly unknown - that require classifications. Aims. The main goal of the VVV Templates Project, which we introduce in this work, is to develop and test the machine-learning algorithms for the automated classification of the VVV light-curves. As VVV is the first massive, multi-epoch survey of stellar variability in the near-IR, the template light-curves that are required for training the classification algorithms are not available. In the first paper of the series we describe the construction of this comprehensive database of infrared stellar variability. Methods. First, we performed a systematic search in the literature and public data archives; second, we coordinated a worldwide observational campaign; and third, we exploited the VVV variability database itself on (optically) well-known stars to gather high-quality infrared light-curves of several hundreds of variable stars. Results. We have now collected a significant (and still increasing) number of infrared template light-curves. This database will be used as a training-set for the machine-learning algorithms that will automatically classify the light-curves produced by VVV. The results of such an automated classification will be covered in forthcoming papers of the series.

J	Zhu, GK; Wang, Q; Yuan, Y				Zhu, Guokang; Wang, Qi; Yuan, Yuan			NATAS: Neural Activity Trace Aware Saliency	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Computer vision; global contrast; machine learning; neural activity trace; preactivation; saliency detection; visual attention	REGION DETECTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; COLOR; MEMORY; SEGMENTATION; PERCEPTION; IMAGES; MODEL	Saliency detection has raised much interest in computer vision recently. Many visual saliency models have been developed for individual images, video clips, and image pairs. However, image sequence, one most general occasion in the real world, is not explored yet. A general image sequence is different from video clips whose temporal continuity is maintained and image pairs where common objects exist. It might contain some similar low-level properties while completely distinct contents. Traditional saliency detection methods will fail on these general sequences. Based on this consideration, this paper investigates the shortcomings of the classical saliency detection methods, which significantly limit their advantages: 1) inability to capture the natural connections among sequential images, 2) over-reliance on motion cues, and 3) restriction to image pairs/videos with common objects. In order to address these problems, we propose a framework that performs the following contributions: 1) construct an image data set as benchmark through a rigorously designed behavioral experiment, 2) propose a neural activity trace aware saliency model to capture the general connections among images, and 3) design a novel measure to handle the low-level clues contained among sequential images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed saliency model is associated with a tremendous advancement compared with traditional methods when dealing with the general image sequence.

Machine Learning Source Separation Using Maximum A Posteriori Nonnegative Matrix Factorization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Blind signal separation; Itakura-Saito divergence; non-negative matrix factorization; single channel; signal processing	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; CONVOLUTIVE MIXTURE; SIGNAL SEPARATION; MODEL	A novel unsupervised machine learning algorithm for single channel source separation is presented. The proposed method is based on nonnegative matrix factorization, which is optimized under the framework of maximum a posteriori probability and Itakura-Saito divergence. The method enables a generalized criterion for variable sparseness to be imposed onto the solution and prior information to be explicitly incorporated through the basis vectors. In addition, the method is scale invariant where both low and high energy components of a signal are treated with equal importance. The proposed algorithm is a more complete and efficient approach for matrix factorization of signals that exhibit temporal dependency of the frequency patterns. Experimental tests have been conducted and compared with other algorithms to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.

In this work, we present a large-scale benchmark evaluation on the second iteration of the publicly released NinaPro database, which contains surface electromyography data for 6 DOF force activations as well as for 40 discrete hand movements. The evaluation involves a modern kernel method and compares performance of three feature representations and three kernel functions. Both the force regression and movement classification problems can be learned successfully when using a nonlinear kernel function, while the exp-kernel outperforms the more popular radial basis function kernel in all cases. Furthermore, combining surface electromyography and accelerometry in a multimodal classifier results in significant increases in accuracy as compared to when either modality is used individually. Since window-based classification accuracy should not be considered in isolation to estimate prosthetic controllability, we also provide results in terms of classification mistakes and prediction delay. To this extent, we propose the movement error rate as an alternative to the standard window-based accuracy. This error rate is insensitive to prediction delays and it allows us therefore to quantify mistakes and delays as independent performance characteristics. This type of analysis confirms that the inclusion of accelerometry is superior, as it results in fewer mistakes while at the same time reducing prediction delay.

This technique uses sequential function approximation, a method that has been used to analyze and solve a variety of dynamic aerospace systems, to develop a multiple-input/single-output neural map. Sequential function approximation, which has previously been used for direct function approximation and solving systems of governing equations meshlessly, uses the error between a set of current and desired system output objectives (in this case, future state vectors) based upon current system inputs: here, the thrust profile of an engine burn, to improve the accuracy of the inputs. A preliminary test case of a lunar flyby in the circular restricted three-body problem is presented as a proof of concept for sequential function approximation as an autonomous navigation and mission-management technique.

J	Sundaramoorthy, S; Shantharajah, SP				Sundaramoorthy, Suriya; Shantharajah, S. P.			AN IMPROVED ANT COLONY ALGORITHM FOR EFFECTIVE MINING OF FREQUENT ITEMS	JOURNAL OF WEB ENGINEERING			English	Article						association rule mining; support; confidence; biologically inspiration; stigmergic communication; pheromone updation; transition probability		Data Mining involves discovery of required potentially qualified content from a heavy collection of heterogeneous data sources. Two decades passed, still it remains the interested area for researchers. It has become a flexible platform for mining engineers to analyse and visualize the hidden relationships among the data sources. Association rules have a strong place in representing those relationships by framing suitable rules. It has two powerful parameters namely support and confidence which helps to carry out framing of such rules. Frequent itemset mining is also termed to be frequent pattern mining. When the combination of items increases rapidly, we term it to be a pattern. The ultimate goal is to design rules over such frequent patterns in an effective manner i.e in terms of time complexity and space complexity. The count of evolutionary algorithms to achieve this goal is increasing day by day. Bio Inspired algorithms holds a strong place in machine learning, mining, evolutionary computing and so on. Ant Colony Algorithm is one such algorithm which is designed based on behaviour of biological inspired ants. This algorithm is adopted for its characteristic of parallel search and dynamic memory allocation. It works comparatively faster than basic Apriori algorithm, AIS, FP Growth algorithm. The two major parameters of this algorithm are pheromone updating rule and transition probability. The basic ant colony algorithm is improved by modifying the pheromone updating rule in such way to reduce multiple scan over data storage and reduced count of candidate sets. The proposed approach was tested using MATLAB along with WEKA toolkit. The experimental results prove that the stigmeric communication of improved ant colony algorithm helps in mining the frequent items faster and effectively than the above stated existing algorithms.

Here, we present a publicly available, large-scale transcription start site (TSS) data set in plants using a high-resolution method for analysis of 5' ends of mRNA transcripts. Our data set is produced using the paired-end analysis of transcription start sites (PEAT) protocol, providing millions of TSS locations from wild-type Columbia-0 Arabidopsis thaliana whole root samples. Using this data set, we grouped TSS reads into "TSS tag clusters" and categorized clusters into three spatial initiation patterns: narrow peak, broad with peak, and weak peak. We then designed a machine learning model that predicts the presence of TSS tag clusters with outstanding sensitivity and specificity for all three initiation patterns. We used this model to analyze the transcription factor binding site content of promoters exhibiting these initiation patterns. In contrast to the canonical notions of TATA-containing and more broad "TATA-less" promoters, the model shows that, in plants, the vast majority of transcription start sites are TATA free and are defined by a large compendium of known DNA sequence binding elements. We present results on the usage of these elements and provide our Plant PEAT Peaks (3PEAT) model that predicts the presence of TSSs directly from sequence.

The interpretation of touch modalities indeed represents a crucial component for the future development of robots that can properly interact with humans. Independently of the specific employed transducer, one of the key issues is how to process the massively complex and high-dimensional tactile data. In this paper, machine learning technologies (namely, support vector machines and extreme learning machines) support a pattern-recognition framework that can fully exploit the tensor morphology of the tactile signal. Furthermore, a practical strategy is provided to address the intricacies of the training procedure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

J	Cheng, MY; Hoang, ND				Cheng, Min-Yuan; Nhat-Duc Hoang			A novel groutability estimation model for ground improvement projects in sandy silt soil based on Bayesian framework	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Groutability prediction; Microfine cement; Bayesian framework; K-nearest neighbor; Machine learning	BEHAVIOR	In construction engineering, permeation grouting with microfine cement is a widely utilized approach for soil improvement. Hence, estimating groutability is a very important task that should be carried out in the planning phase of any grouting project. This research aims at establishing a novel method for groutability prediction with the utilization of microfine cement in sandy silt soil. The newly proposed approach integrates the Bayesian framework and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) density estimation technique. The Bayesian framework is used to achieve probabilistic groutability estimations. Meanwhile, the K-NN method is employed to approximate the conditional probability density functions. Moreover, to establish the new approach, 240 in-situ grouting cases have been recorded during the progress of Mass Rapid Transit and highway projects in Taiwan.

In this paper we present SUNNY: a simple and flexible algorithm that takes advantage of a portfolio of constraint solvers in order to compute - without learning an explicit model - a schedule of them for solving a given Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Motivated by the performance reached by SUNNY vs. different simulations of other state of the art approaches, we developed sunny-csp, an effective portfolio solver that exploits the underlying SUNNY algorithm in order to solve a given CSP. Empirical tests conducted on exhaustive benchmarks of MiniZinc models show that the actual performance of sunny-csp conforms to the predictions. This is encouraging both for improving the power of CSP portfolio solvers and for trying to export them to fields such as Answer Set Programming and Constraint Logic Programming.

For the construction of the adequate models, several authors has been explored complex heuristic like the recurrent neural networks, multi-layer support vector machines, bio-inspired algorithms or the combination of classifiers, but all these efforts are not enough. In the current manuscript the structure prediction methods based on machine learning are discussed. These methods are classified in different taxonomies and also a detailed description of each paradigm is provided, highlighting its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the current tendencies and the last advances in the research of protein structure prediction are showed.

A useful indicator for evaluating roughness is the weighted longitudinal profile (wLP). In this paper, three machine learning models are compared for estimating the wLP when vehicle response information, i.e., accelerometer and wheel speed data is collected from common in-vehicle sensors. A multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest were applied for testing their effectiveness in estimating the key indices of wLP, namely, range and standard deviation. These models were trained from a set of features extracted from vehicle response simulations on accurate replications of roads with various roughness problems. In contrast to other research, the authors validated models with measurements collected with a probe vehicle. The results show that roughness phenomena can be accurately detected. The SVM produced the best results, although the models achieved rather similar performance. However, differences were found regarding the model robustness when reducing the size of the training feature set. The proposed method enables road network monitoring to be achieved by conventional passenger cars, which can be seen as a practical supplement to the prevalent road measurements with cost-intensive mobile devices.

This paper aims to study the characteristics of online depression communities (CLINICAL) in comparison with those joining other online communities (CONTROL). We use machine learning and statistical methods to discriminate online messages between depression and control communities using mood, psycholinguistic processes and content topics extracted from the posts generated by members of these communities. All aspects including mood, the written content and writing style are found to be significantly different between two types of communities. Sentiment analysis shows the clinical group have lower valence than people in the control group. For language styles and topics, statistical tests reject the hypothesis of equality on psycholinguistic processes and topics between two groups. We show good predictive validity in depression classification using topics and psycholinguistic clues as features. Clear discrimination between writing styles and contents, with good predictive power is an important step in understanding social media and its use in mental health.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						Affect annotation; affect modelling; ratings; ranks; preference learning; classification; computer games; sensitive artificial listener (SAL) corpus	MODELS; RECOGNITION; EMOTIONS	How should affect be appropriately annotated and how should machine learning best be employed to map manifestations of affect to affect annotations? What is the use of ratings of affect for the study of affective computing and how should we treat them? These are the key questions this paper attempts to address by investigating the impact of dissimilar representations of annotated affect on the efficacy of affect modelling. In particular, we compare several different binary-class and pairwise preference representations for automatically learning from ratings of affect. The representations are compared and tested on three datasets: one synthetic dataset (testing "in vitro") and two affective datasets (testing "in vivo"). The synthetic dataset couples a number of attributes with generated rating values. The two affective datasets contain physiological and contextual user attributes, and speech attributes, respectively; these attributes are coupled with ratings of various affective and cognitive states. The main results of the paper suggest that ratings (when used) should be naturally transformed to ordinal (ranked) representations for obtaining more reliable and generalisable models of affect. The findings of this paper have a direct impact on affect annotation and modelling research but, most importantly, challenge the traditional state-of-practice in affective computing and psychometrics at large.

Many methods for feature extraction have been studied and the selection of both appropriate features and electrode locations is usually based on neuro-scientific findings. Their suitability for emotion recognition, however, has been tested using a small amount of distinct feature sets and on different, usually small data sets. A major limitation is that no systematic comparison of features exists. Therefore, we review feature extraction methods for emotion recognition from EEG based on 33 studies. An experiment is conducted comparing these features using machine learning techniques for feature selection on a self recorded data set. Results are presented with respect to performance of different feature selection methods, usage of selected feature types, and selection of electrode locations. Features selected by multivariate methods slightly outperform univariate methods. Advanced feature extraction techniques are found to have advantages over commonly used spectral power bands. Results also suggest preference to locations over parietal and centro-parietal lobes.

This work examines a layered architecture that operates on different temporal granularities to infer complex patterns of user preferences. Classical hidden Markov models (HMM), conditioned HMM (CHMM) and fuzzy CI-IMM (FCHMM) are compared to find the best configuration in the lower architecture Layers. In the uppermost layer, a Markov logic network (MLN) is applied to infer the user preference in a probabilistic rule-based manner. For each layer a comprehensive evaluation is given. We provide empirical evidence showing that the layered architecture using FCHMM and MLN is well-suited to recognize patterns on different layers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, how well such models correspond to in vivo brain has not been evaluated in an unbiased, comprehensive manner. We used transcriptomic analyses to compare in vitro systems to developing human fetal brain and observed strong conservation of in vivo gene expression and network architecture in differentiating primary human neural progenitor cells (phNPCs). Conserved modules are enriched in genes associated with ASD, supporting the utility of phNPCs for studying neuropsychiatric disease. We also developed and validated a machine learning approach called CoNTExT that identifies the developmental maturity and regional identity of in vitro models. We observed strong differences between in vitro models, including hiPSC-derived neural progenitors from multiple laboratories. This work provides a systems biology framework for evaluating in vitro systems and supports their value in studying the molecular mechanisms of human neurodevelopmental disease.

The etiology of severe liver disease affects treatment options and priorities for liver transplantation and organ allocation. Thus we compared physiologically similar NAFLD and ALD patients to detect biochemical differences for improved separation of these mechanistically overlapping etiologies. Methods: In a cohort of 31 NAFLD patients with BMI below 30 and a cohort of ALD patient with (ALDC n = 51) or without cirrhosis (ALDNC n = 51) serum transaminases, cell death markers and (adipo-) cytokines were assessed. Groups were compared with One-way ANOVA and Tukey's correction. Predictive models were built by machine learning techniques. Results: NAFLD, ALDNC or ALDC patients did not differ in demographic parameters. The ratio of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase - common serum parameters for liver damage - was significantly higher in the NAFLD group compared to both ALD groups (each p<0.0001). Adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-alpha were significantly lower in NAFLD than in ALDNC (p<0.05) or ALDC patients (p<0.0001). Significantly higher serum concentrations of cell death markers, hyaluronic acid, adiponectin, and TNF-alpha (each p<0.0001) were found in ALDC compared to ALDNC. Using machine learning techniques we were able to discern NAFLD and ALDNC (up to an AUC of 0.9118+/-0.0056) or ALDC and ALDNC (up to an AUC of 0.9846+/-0.0018), respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning techniques relying on ALT/AST ratio, adipokines and cytokines distinguish NAFLD and ALD. In addition, severity of ALD may be non-invasively diagnosed via serum cytokine concentrations.

This paper discusses the crucial issues related to the application of different up-to-date machine learning classifiers: classification trees (CT), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF). The analysis of the statistical significance of the differences between the performance of these algorithms, as well as sensitivity to data set size reduction and noise were also analysed. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land cover categories in south Spain. Overall, statistically similar accuracies of over 91% were obtained for ANN, SVM and RF. However, the findings of this study show differences in the accuracy of the classifiers, being RF the most accurate classifier with a very simple parameterization. SVM, followed by RF, was the most robust classifier to noise and data reduction. Significant differences in their performances were only reached for thresholds of noise and data reduction greater than 20% (noise, SVM) and 25% (noise, RF), and 80% (reduction, SVM) and 50% (reduction, RF), respectively.

Some ideas, like the cost-sensitive learning approach, are proposed to face this problem. In this paper, we propose two greedy wrapper forward cost-sensitive selective naive Bayes approaches. Both approaches readjust the probability thresholds of each class to select the class with the minimum-expected cost. The first algorithm (CS-SNB-Accuracy) considers adding each variable to the model and measures the performance of the resulting model on the training data. The variable that most improves the accuracy, that is, the percentage of well classified instances between the readjusted class and actual class, is permanently added to the model. In contrast, the second algorithm (CS-SNB-Cost) considers adding variables that reduce the misclassification cost, that is, the distance between the readjusted class and actual class. We have tested our algorithms on the bibliometric indices prediction area. Considering the popularity of the well-known h-index, we have researched and built several prediction models to forecast the annual increase of the h-index for Neurosciences journals in a four-year time horizon. Results show that our approaches, particularly CS-SNB-Accuracy, achieved higher accuracy values than the analyzed cost-sensitive classifiers and Bayesian classifiers. Furthermore, we also noted that the CS-SNB-Cost always achieved a lower average cost than all analyzed cost-sensitive and cost-insensitive classifiers. These cost-sensitive selective naive Bayes approaches outperform the selective naive Bayes in terms of accuracy and average cost, so the cost-sensitive learning approach could be also applied in different probabilistic classification approaches.

Many such companies rely on information extractors to integrate information that is buried into semi-structured web documents into automatic business processes. Many information extractors build on extraction rules, which can be handcrafted or learned using supervised or unsupervised techniques. The literature provides a variety of techniques to learn information extraction rules that build on ad hoc machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that explores the use of standard machine-learning techniques to extract web information. We have specifically explored using neural networks; our results show that our proposal outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques in the literature, which opens up quite a new approach to information extraction.

Machine learning, medical diagnosis, and biomedical engineering research - commentary	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; Classifiers; Image processing; Machine learning; Support vector machine	SIMULATION	A large number of papers are appearing in the biomedical engineering literature that describe the use of machine learning techniques to develop classifiers for detection or diagnosis of disease. However, the usefulness of this approach in developing clinically validated diagnostic techniques so far has been limited and the methods are prone to overfitting and other problems which may not be immediately apparent to the investigators. This commentary is intended to help sensitize investigators as well as readers and reviewers of papers to some potential pitfalls in the development of classifiers, and suggests steps that researchers can take to help avoid these problems. Building classifiers should be viewed not simply as an add-on statistical analysis, but as part and parcel of the experimental process. Validation of classifiers for diagnostic applications should be considered as part of a much larger process of establishing the clinical validity of the diagnostic technique.

However, these findings vary across studies and between regions. Therefore, in this study, we used tract-based spatial statistics along with machine learning approaches to investigate the whole-brain white matter changes between 17 left mTLE patients and 15 right mTLE patients and 34 matched healthy controls. The results showed that the three groups could be distinguished from each other with promising accuracy. Compared with controls, the FA value of the most discriminating voxels was decreased in the ipsilateral limbic system, corpus callosum, and temporal white matter in both patient groups. Compared with right mTLE, left mTLE had decreased FA in the left temporal white matter, whereas right mTLE had decreased FA in the right frontal and temporal white matter, and right posterior corona radiata. These findings not only provide useful information for lateralization of the seizure focus but can also be used as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of the mTLE. This may be helpful in assessment of patients with mTLE when no lesion is detected on visual evaluation.

The Bone Scan Index (BSI) measures the tumor burden on the skeleton, expressed as a percentage of the total skeletal mass. Previous studies have shown that BSI is associated with survival of prostate cancer patients. The objective in this study was to investigate to what extent regional BSI measurements, as obtained by an automated method, can improve the survival analysis for advanced prostate cancer. Methods: The automated method for analyzing bone scan images computed BSI values for twelve skeletal regions, in a study population consisting of 1013 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. In the survival analysis we used the standard Cox proportional hazards model and a more advanced non-linear method based on artificial neural networks. The concordance index (C-index) was used to measure the performance of the models. Results: A Cox model with age and total BSI obtained a C-index of 70.4%. The best Cox model with regional measurements from Costae, Pelvis, Scapula and the Spine, together with age, got a similar C-index (70.5%). The overall best single skeletal localisation, as measured by the C-index, was Costae. The non-linear model performed equally well as the Cox model, ruling out any significant non-linear interactions among the regional BSI measurements. Conclusion: The present study showed that the localisation of bone metastases obtained from the bone scans in prostate cancer patients does not improve the performance of the survival models compared to models using the total BSI. However a ranking procedure indicated that some regions are more important than others.

In practice, boosting techniques are among the most widely used machine learning for various reasons. This is mainly due to low false positive rate of the cascade structure offering the possibility to be trained by different classes of object. However, it is especially used for face detection since it is the most popular sub-problem within object detection. The challenges of Adaboost based face detector include the selection of the most relevant features from a large feature set which are considered as weak classifiers. In many scenarios, however, selection of features based on lowering classification errors leads to computation complexity and excess of memory use. In this work, we propose a new method to train an effective detector by discarding redundant weak classifiers while achieving the pre-determined learning objective. To achieve this, on the one hand, we modify AdaBoost training so that the feature selection process is not based any more on the weak learner's training error. This is by incorporating the Genetic Algorithm (GA) on the training process. On the other hand, we make use of the Joint Integral Histogram in order to extract more powerful features. Experimental performance on human faces show that our proposed method requires smaller number of weak classifiers than the conventional learning algorithm, resulting in higher learning and faster classification rates. So, our method outperforms significantly state-of-the-art cascade methods in terms of detection rate and false positive rate and especially in reducing the number of weak classifiers per stage.

The method uses a quantum-classical hybrid simulator, where a 'quantum student' is being taught by a 'classical teacher'. In other words, in our method, the learning system is supposed to evolve into a quantum algorithm for a given problem, assisted by a classical main-feedback system. Our method is applicable for designing quantum oracle-based algorithms. We chose, as a case study, an oracle decision problem, called a Deutsch-Jozsa problem. We showed by using Monte Carlo simulations that our simulator can faithfully learn a quantum algorithm for solving the problem for a given oracle. Remarkably, the learning time is proportional to the square root of the total number of parameters, rather than showing the exponential dependence found in the classical machine learning-based method.

Computational models of liver fibrosis progression for hepatitis C virus chronic infection	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							RECURRENT HEPATITIS; TRANSPLANTATION; GENOTYPES; COMBINATION; STEATOSIS; CIRRHOSIS; NETWORKS	Background: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a risk factor for liver diseases such as fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV genetic heterogeneity was hypothesized to be associated with severity of liver disease. However, no reliable viral markers predicting disease severity have been identified. Here, we report the utility of sequences from 3 HCV 1b genomic regions, Core, NS3 and NS5b, to identify viral genetic markers associated with fast and slow rate of fibrosis progression (RFP) among patients with and without liver transplantation (n = 42). Methods: A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method was used to detect and identify RFP-relevant viral markers. Machine-learning techniques, linear projection (LP) and Bayesian Networks (BN), were used to assess and identify associations between the HCV sequences and RFP. Results: Both clustering of HCV sequences in LP graphs using physicochemical properties of nucleotides and BN analysis using polymorphic sites showed similarities among HCV variants sampled from patients with a similar RFP, while distinct HCV genetic properties were found associated with fast or slow RFP. Several RFP-relevant HCV sites were identified. Computational models parameterized using the identified sites accurately associated HCV strains with RFP in 70/30 split cross-validation (90-95% accuracy) and in validation tests (85-90% accuracy). Validation tests of the models constructed for patients with or without liver transplantation suggest that the RFP-relevant genetic markers identified in the HCV Core, NS3 and NS5b genomic regions may be useful for the prediction of RFP regardless of transplant status of patients. Conclusions: The apparent strong genetic association to RFP suggests that HCV genetic heterogeneity has a quantifiable effect on severity of liver disease, thus presenting opportunity for developing genetic assays for measuring virulence of HCV strains in clinical and public health settings.

Several models exist to predict specific PTMs, from manually detected patterns to machine learning methods. On one hand, the manual detection of patterns does not provide the most efficient classifiers and requires an important workload, and on the other hand, models built by machine learning methods are hard to interpret and do not increase biological knowledge. Therefore, we developed a novel method based on patterns discovery and decision trees to predict PTMs. The proposed algorithm builds a decision tree, by coupling the C4.5 algorithm with genetic algorithms, producing high-performance white box classifiers. Our method was tested on the initiator methionine cleavage (IMC) and N-alpha-terminal acetylation (N-Ac), two of the most common PTMs. Results: The resulting classifiers perform well when compared with existing models. On a set of eukaryotic proteins, they display a cross-validated Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.83 (IMC) and 0.65 (N-Ac). When used to predict potential substrates of N-terminal acetyltransferaseB and N-terminal acetyltransferaseC, our classifiers display better performance than the state of the art. Moreover, we present an analysis of the model predicting IMC for Homo sapiens proteins and demonstrate that we are able to extract experimentally known facts without prior knowledge. Those results validate the fact that our method produces white box models.

However, they lack haptic feedback. This is dangerous near e. g. nerve tissue, which has to be preserved during surgery. One solution to this problem is to train an algorithm that analyzes the reflected light spectra during surgery and can classify these spectra into different tissue types, in order to ultimately send a warning or temporarily switch off the laser when critical tissue is about to be ablated. Various machine learning algorithms are available for this task, but a detailed analysis is needed to assess the most appropriate algorithm. Methods: In this study, a small data set is used to simulate many larger data sets according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Various machine learning algorithms are then trained and evaluated on these data sets. The algorithms' performance is subsequently evaluated and compared by averaged confusion matrices and ultimately by boxplots of misclassification rates. The results are validated on the smaller, experimental data set. Results: Most classifiers have a median misclassification rate below 0.25 in the simulated data. The most notable performance was observed for the Penalized Discriminant Analysis, with a misclassifiaction rate of 0.00 in the simulated data, and an average misclassification rate of 0.02 in a 10-fold cross validation on the original data. Conclusion: The results suggest a Penalized Discriminant Analysis is the most promising approach, most probably because it considers the functional, correlated nature of the reflectance spectra. The results of this study improve the accuracy of real-time tissue discrimination and are an essential step towards improving the safety of oral laser surgery.

Semi-Supervised Morphosyntactic Classification of Old Icelandic	PLOS ONE			English	Article								We present IceMorph, a semi-supervised morphosyntactic analyzer of Old Icelandic. In addition to machine-read corpora and dictionaries, it applies a small set of declension prototypes to map corpus words to dictionary entries. A web-based GUI allows expert users to modify and augment data through an online process. A machine learning module incorporates prototype data, edit-distance metrics, and expert feedback to continuously update part-of-speech and morphosyntactic classification. An advantage of the analyzer is its ability to achieve competitive classification accuracy with minimum training data.

Some features of HAND resemble those of age-associated cognitive decline in the absence of HIV, suggesting that overlapping mechanisms may contribute to neurocognitive impairment. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 100 individuals (46 HIV-positive patients and 54 HIV-negative controls). Methods: Untargeted CSF metabolite profiling was performed using liquid/gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Cytokine profiling was performed by Bioplex. Bioinformatic analyses were performed in Metaboanalyst and R. Results: Alterations in the CSF metabolome of HIV patients on ART mapped to pathways associated with neurotransmitter production, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and metabolic waste. Many CSF metabolites altered in HIV overlapped with those altered with advanced age in HIV-negative controls, suggesting a pattern indicative of accelerated aging. Machine learning models identified neurotransmitters (glutamate, N-acetylaspartate), markers of glial activation (myo-inositol), and ketone bodies (betahydroxybutyric acid, 1,2-propanediol) as top-ranked classifiers of HAND. These CSF metabolites correlated with worse neurocognitive test scores, plasma inflammatory biomarkers [interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-2Ra], and intrathecal IFN responses (IFN-gamma and kynurenine : tryptophan ratio), suggesting inter-relationships between systemic and intrathecal inflammation and metabolic alterations in CSF. Conclusions: Alterations in the CSF metabolome of HIV patients on ART suggest that persistent inflammation, glial responses, glutamate neurotoxicity, and altered brain waste disposal systems contribute to mechanisms involved in HAND that may be augmented with aging.

J	Kamath, U; De Jong, K; Shehu, A				Kamath, Uday; De Jong, Kenneth; Shehu, Amarda			Effective Automated Feature Construction and Selection for Classification of Biological Sequences	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPLICE-SITE PREDICTION; FACTOR-BINDING SITES; I-HYPERSENSITIVE SITE; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DNASE-I; REGULATORY MODULES; ACCURATE RECOGNITION; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; MUTUAL INFORMATION	Background: Many open problems in bioinformatics involve elucidating underlying functional signals in biological sequences. DNA sequences, in particular, are characterized by rich architectures in which functional signals are increasingly found to combine local and distal interactions at the nucleotide level. Problems of interest include detection of regulatory regions, splice sites, exons, hypersensitive sites, and more. These problems naturally lend themselves to formulation as classification problems in machine learning. When classification is based on features extracted from the sequences under investigation, success is critically dependent on the chosen set of features. Methodology: We present an algorithmic framework (EFFECT) for automated detection of functional signals in biological sequences. We focus here on classification problems involving DNA sequences which state-of-the-art work in machine learning shows to be challenging and involve complex combinations of local and distal features. EFFECT uses a two-stage process to first construct a set of candidate sequence-based features and then select a most effective subset for the classification task at hand. Both stages make heavy use of evolutionary algorithms to efficiently guide the search towards informative features capable of discriminating between sequences that contain a particular functional signal and those that do not. Results: To demonstrate its generality, EFFECT is applied to three separate problems of importance in DNA research: the recognition of hypersensitive sites, splice sites, and ALU sites. Comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms show that the framework is both general and powerful. In addition, a detailed analysis of the constructed features shows that they contain valuable biological information about DNA architecture, allowing biologists and other researchers to directly inspect the features and potentially use the insights obtained to assist wet-laboratory studies on retainment or modification of a specific signal.

A simple late fusion approach for the speaker detection task on the i-vector challenge is presented. The approach is based on the late fusion of scores from the cosine distance method (the baseline) and the scores obtained from linear discriminant analysis.

J	Stowell, D; Plumbley, MD				Stowell, Dan; Plumbley, Mark D.			Automatic large-scale classification of bird sounds is strongly improved by unsupervised feature learning	PEERJ			English	Article						Bioacoustics; Machine learning; Birds; Classification; Vocalisation; Birdsong	RECOGNITION; REPRESENTATION	Automatic species classification of birds from their sound is a computational tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can be performed at large scale and "unsupervised", meaning it requires no manual data labelling, yet it can improve performance on "supervised" tasks such as classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, classified using a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that in our classification tasks, MFCCs can often lead to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data from which they are derived. Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain. However, for one of our datasets, which contains substantial audio data but few annotations, increased performance is not discernible. We study the interaction between dataset characteristics and choice of feature representation through further empirical analysis.

J	Wang, J				Wang, Jing			Real local-linearity preserving embedding	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Manifold learning; Local geometry; Locally linear embedding; Wrong neighbors	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; TRANSFORMATION; RECOGNITION	In recent years, manifold learning methods have aroused a great interest in the machine learning community. A key issue that determines the effectiveness of the manifold learning methods is how to accurately capture the local geometry of the low-dimensional manifold. However, most of the manifold learning algorithms cannot exploit the real local geometry if the neighbors for each sample point are not correctly selected. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of locally linear embedding (LLE). A new local optimization model is proposed to find the local weights that can represent the real local manifold geometry when the neighborhoods contain wrong neighbors. A new algorithm called real local-linearity preserving embedding (RLLPE) is then proposed by preserving the exploited real local geometry. We demonstrate the improvement and efficiency of RLLPE using both synthetic and real-word data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automatic medical diagnosis classification tools reduce financial burden on health care systems. In medical diagnosis, patterns consist of observable symptoms and the results of diagnostic tests, which have various associated costs and risks. In this paper, we have experimented and suggested an automated pattern classification method for classifying four diseases into two classes. In the literature on machine learning or data mining, regression and classification problems are typically viewed as two distinct problems differentiated by continuous or categorical dependent variables. There are endeavors to use regression methods to solve classification problems and vice versa. To regard a classification problem as a regression one, we propose a method based on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) classification model as one of the powerful methods in intelligent field management. We apply the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), a kind of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to find mapping points (MPs) for rounding a real-value to an integer one. Also, we employ the NSGA-II to find out and tune the SVR kernel parameters optimally so as to enhance the performance of our model and achieve better results. The results of the study are compared with the results of some previous studies focusing on the diagnoses of four diseases using the same UCI machine learning database. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields a superior and competitive performance in these four real-world datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, S; Wu, LS; Jiao, LC; Liu, HY				Wang, Shuang; Wu, Linsheng; Jiao, Licheng; Liu, Hongying			Improve the performance of co-training by committee with refinement of class probability estimations	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Co-training; Semi-supervised learning; Ensemble learning; Class probability; Distance metric; Data editing	EXPLOITING UNLABELED DATA; 3-D OBJECT RETRIEVAL; DECISION TREES; IMAGE SEARCH; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; EM	Semi-supervised learning is a popular machine learning technique where only a small number of labeled examples are available and a large pool of unlabeled examples can be obtained easily. In co-training by committee, a paradigm of semi-supervised learning, it is necessary to pick out a fixed number of most confident examples according to the ranking of class probability values at each iteration. Unfortunately, the class probability values may repeat, which results in the problem that some unlabeled instances share the same probability and will be picked out randomly. This brings a negative effect on the improvement of the performance of classifiers. In this paper, we propose a simple method to deal with this problem under the intuition that different probabilities are crucial. The distance metric between unlabeled instances and labeled instances can be combined with the probabilities of class membership of committee. Two distance metrics are considered to assign each unlabeled example a unique probability value. In order to prove that our method can get higher-quality examples and reduce the introduction of noise, a data editing technique is used to compare with our method. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method and the data editing technique, and also confirm that the method for the first distance metric is generally better than the data editing technique.

The typology was established on two concepts: the nature of the forces created within the water and the type of inter-limb coordination used. Thirty-eight participants were videotaped while treading water. Multivariate statistics were used to understand how the different behavioural types related to expertise. Three distinct groups of coordination patterns were adopted during treading water. A support vector machine procedure was used as a confirmatory procedure. The data mining process provides a methodological framework to analyse expertise in sports activities, and in this context suggests that a taxonomy can be established among the numerous coordination solutions that allow humans to create stabilising forces in the water.

J	Meng, J; Shi, L; Luan, YS				Meng, Jun; Shi, Lin; Luan, Yushi			Plant microRNA-Target Interaction Identification Model Based on the Integration of Prediction Tools and Support Vector Machine	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENE-REGULATION; BINDING-SITES; MIRNA TARGETS; WEB SERVER; RNA; DEGRADOME; RECOGNITION; SIRNA; TRANSCRIPTOME; BIOGENESIS	Background: Confident identification of microRNA-target interactions is significant for studying the function of microRNA (miRNA). Although some computational miRNA target prediction methods have been proposed for plants, results of various methods tend to be inconsistent and usually lead to more false positive. To address these issues, we developed an integrated model for identifying plant miRNA-target interactions. Results: Three online miRNA target prediction toolkits and machine learning algorithms were integrated to identify and analyze Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA-target interactions. Principle component analysis (PCA) feature extraction and self-training technology were introduced to improve the performance. Results showed that the proposed model outperformed the previously existing methods. The results were validated by using degradome sequencing supported Arabidopsis thaliana miRNA-target interactions. The proposed model constructed on Arabidopsis thaliana was run over Oryza sativa and Vitis vinifera to demonstrate that our model is effective for other plant species. Conclusions: The integrated model of online predictors and local PCA-SVM classifier gained credible and high quality miRNA-target interactions. The supervised learning algorithm of PCA-SVM classifier was employed in plant miRNA target identification for the first time. Its performance can be substantially improved if more experimentally proved training samples are provided.

Evaluation and construction of diagnostic criteria for inclusion body myositis	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							POLYMYOSITIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; NETHERLANDS; MYOPATHIES	Objective: To use patient data to evaluate and construct diagnostic criteria for inclusion body myositis (IBM), a progressive disease of skeletal muscle. Methods: The literature was reviewed to identify all previously proposed IBM diagnostic criteria. These criteria were applied through medical records review to 200 patients diagnosed as having IBM and 171 patients diagnosed as having a muscle disease other than IBM by neuromuscular specialists at 2 institutions, and to a validating set of 66 additional patients with IBM from 2 other institutions. Machine learning techniques were used for unbiased construction of diagnostic criteria. Results: Twenty-four previously proposed IBM diagnostic categories were identified. Twelve categories all performed with high (>= 97%) specificity but varied substantially in their sensitivities (11%-84%). The best performing category was European Neuromuscular Centre 2013 probable (sensitivity of 84%). Specialized pathologic features and newly introduced strength criteria (comparative knee extension/hip flexion strength) performed poorly. Unbiased data-directed analysis of 20 features in 371 patients resulted in construction of higher-performing data-derived diagnostic criteria (90% sensitivity and 96% specificity). Conclusions: Published expert consensus-derived IBM diagnostic categories have uniformly high specificity but wide-ranging sensitivities. High-performing IBM diagnostic category criteria can be developed directly from principled unbiased analysis of patient data. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that published expert consensus-derived IBM diagnostic categories accurately distinguish IBM from other muscle disease with high specificity but wide-ranging sensitivities.

With this transition from the traditional group level difference investigations to single-subject inference, the application of machine learning methods can be seen as a considerable step forward. Existing studies, however, have given scarce or no information on the generalizability to other subject samples, limiting the use of such published classifiers in other research projects. We conducted a simulation study using publicly available resting-state fMRI data from the 1000 Functional Connectomes and COBRE projects to examine the generalizability of classifiers based on regional homogeneity of resting-state time series. While classification accuracies of up to 0.8 (using sex as the target variable) could be achieved on test datasets drawn from the same study as the training dataset, the generalizability of classifiers to different study samples proved to be limited albeit above chance. This shows that on the one hand a certain amount of generalizability can robustly be expected, but on the other hand this generalizability should not be overestimated. Indeed, this study substantiates the need to include data from several sites in a study investigating machine learning classifiers with the aim of generalizability.

J	Fechter, K; Porollo, A				Fechter, Kenneth; Porollo, Aleksey			MutaCYP: Classification of missense mutations in human cytochromes P450	BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS			English	Article						Human CYP variants; Human CYP polymorphism; Machine learning based prediction; Classification of missense mutations; Relative solvent accessibility; Evolutionary information	SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; PREDICTION; VARIANTS; PROTEIN; SEQUENCE; DATABASE; CYP; 1-ALPHA-HYDROXYLASE; MONOOXYGENASES; POLYMORPHISMS	Background: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) represent a large and diverse family of enzymes involved in various biological processes in humans. Individual genome sequencing has revealed multiple mutations in human CYPs, and many missense mutations have been associated with variety of diseases. Since 3D structures are not resolved for most human CYPs, there is a need for a reliable sequence-based prediction that discriminates benign and disease causing mutations. Methods: A new prediction method (MutaCYP) has been developed for scoring de novo missense mutations to have a deleterious effect. The method utilizes only five features, all of which are sequence-based: predicted relative solvent accessibility (RSA), variance of predicted RSA among the residues in close sequence proximity, Z-score of Shannon entropy for a given position, difference in similarity scores and weighted difference in size between wild type and new amino acids. The method is based on a single neural network. Results: MutaCYP achieves MCC = 0.70, Q2 = 88.52%, Recall = 93.40% with Precision = 91.09%, and AUC = 0.909. Comparative evaluation with other existing methods indicates that MutaCYP outperforms SIFT and PolyPhen-2. Predictions by MutaCYP appear to be orthogonal to predictions by the evaluated methods. Potential issues on reliability of annotations of mutations in the existing databases are discussed. Conclusions: A new accurate method, MutaCYP, for classification of missense mutations in human CYPs is presented. The prediction model consists of only five sequence-based features, including a real-valued predicted relative solvent accessibility. The method is publicly available at http://research.cchmc.org/MutaSense/.

Here, we show that H3K4me3 domains that spread more broadly over genes in a given cell type preferentially mark genes that are essential for the identity and function of that cell type. Using the broadest H3K4me3 domains as a discovery tool in neural progenitor cells, we identify novel regulators of these cells. Machine learning models reveal that the broadest H3K4me3 domains represent a distinct entity, characterized by increased marks of elongation. The broadest H3K4me3 domains also have more paused polymerase at their promoters, suggesting a unique transcriptional output. Indeed, genes marked by the broadest H3K4me3 domains exhibit enhanced transcriptional consistency rather than increased transcriptional levels, and perturbation of H3K4me3 breadth leads to changes in transcriptional consistency. Thus, H3K4me3 breadth contains information that could ensure transcriptional precision at key cell identity/function genes.

Due to the limitations of traditional port-based and payload-based classification approaches, the past several years have seen extensive research on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify Internet traffic based on packet and flow level characteristics. For the purpose of learning from unlabeled traffic data, some classic clustering methods have been applied in previous studies but the reported accuracy results are unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach for accurate Internet traffic clustering, which is motivated by the observation of widely existing partial equivalence relationships among Internet traffic flows. In particular, we formulate the problem using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with set-based equivalence constraint and propose a constrained Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for clustering. Experiments with real-world packet traces show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the quality of resultant traffic clusters. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Pseudo structures are usually present with regularities. This letter proposes a machine learning based blocking artifacts metric for JPEG images by measuring the regularities of pseudo structures. Image corner, block boundary and color change properties are used to differentiate the blocking artifacts. A support vector regression (SVR) model is adopted to learn the underlying relations between these features and perceived blocking artifacts. The blocking artifacts score of a test image is predicted using the trained model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

J	Castelli, M; Vanneschi, L; Silva, S				Castelli, Mauro; Vanneschi, Leonardo; Silva, Sara			Prediction of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale assessment using a genetic programming system with geometric semantic genetic operators	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; Genetic programming; Geometric operators; Semantics	CLASSIFICATION; BURDEN	Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessment is the most used scale for tracking Parkinson's disease symptom progression. Nowadays, the tracking process requires a patient to undergo invasive and time-consuming specialized examinations in hospital clinics, under the supervision of trained medical staff. Thus, the process is costly and logistically inconvenient for both patients and clinicians. For this reason, new powerful computational tools, aimed at making the process more automatic, cheaper and less invasive, are becoming more and more a necessity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of an innovative intelligent system based on genetic programming for the prediction of UPDRS assessment, using only data derived from simple, self-administered and non-invasive speech tests. The system we propose is called geometric semantic genetic programming and it is based on recently defined geometric semantic genetic operators. Experimental results, achieved using the largest database of Parkinson's disease speech in existence (approximately 6000 recordings from 42 Parkinson's disease patients, recruited in a six-month, multi-centre trial), show the appropriateness of the proposed system for the prediction of UPDRS assessment. In particular, the results obtained with geometric semantic genetic programming are significantly better than the ones produced by standard genetic programming and other state of the art machine learning methods both on training and unseen test data.

The design of efficient fraud detection algorithms is key for reducing these losses, and more algorithms rely on advanced machine learning techniques to assist fraud investigators. The design of fraud detection algorithms is however particularly challenging due to non-stationary distribution of the data, highly imbalanced classes distributions and continuous streams of transactions. At the same time public data are scarcely available for confidentiality issues, leaving unanswered many questions about which is the best strategy to deal with them. In this paper we provide some answers from the practitioner's perspective by focusing on three crucial issues: unbalancedness, non-stationarity and assessment. The analysis is made possible by a real credit card dataset provided by our industrial partner. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Where the adjustment of a parameter is required, this parameter will be tested until viable results are obtained. Normally, such adjustments are made by the developer deploying the metaheuristic. The quality of the results of a test instance [The term instance is used to refer to the assignment of values to the input variables of a problem.] will not be transferred to the instances that were not tested yet and its feedback may require a slow process of '' trial and error '' where the algorithm has to be adjusted for a specific application. Within this context of metaheuristics the Reactive Search emerged defending the integration of machine learning within heuristic searches for solving complex optimization problems. Based in the integration that the Reactive Search proposes between machine learning and metaheuristics, emerged the idea of putting Reinforcement Learning, more specifically the Q-learning algorithm with a reactive behavior, to select which local search is the most appropriate in a given time of a search, to succeed another local search that can not improve the current solution in the VNS metaheuristic. In this work we propose a reactive implementation using Reinforcement Learning for the self-tuning of the implemented algorithm, applied to the Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem.

However, it is difficult to extract important summary information from many millions of tweets sent every hour. In this work we propose a new concept, sentimental causal rules, and techniques for extracting sentimental causal rules from textual data sources such as Twitter which combine sentiment analysis and causal rule discovery. Sentiment analysis refers to the task of extracting public sentiment from textual data. The value in sentiment analysis lies in its ability to reflect popularly voiced perceptions that are stated in natural language. Causal rules on the other hand indicate associations between different concepts in a context where one (or several concepts) cause(s) the other(s). We believe that sentimental causal rules are an effective summarization mechanism that combine causal relations among different aspects extracted from textual data as well as the sentiment embedded in these causal relationships. In order to show the effectiveness of sentimental causal rules, we have conducted experiments on Twitter data collected on the Kurdish political issue in Turkey which has been an ongoing heated public debate for many years. Our experiments on Twitter data show that sentimental causal rule discovery is an effective method to summarize information about important aspects of an issue in Twitter which may further be used by politicians for better policy making.

Good recognition is non-metric	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Machine learning; Metric learning; Recognition; Computer vision; Face recognition; Object recognition	FACE RECOGNITION; VERIFICATION; DISSIMILARITIES; REPRESENTATION; SIMILARITY	Recognition is the fundamental task of visual cognition, yet how to formalize the general recognition problem for computer vision remains an open issue. The problem is sometimes reduced to the simplest case of recognizing matching pairs, often structured to allow for metric constraints. However, visual recognition is broader than just pair-matching: what we learn and how we learn it has important implications for effective algorithms. In this review paper, we reconsider the assumption of recognition as a pair-matching test, and introduce a new formal definition that captures the broader context of the problem. Through a meta-analysis and an experimental assessment of the top algorithms on popular data sets, we gain a sense of how often metric properties are violated by recognition algorithms. By studying these violations, useful insights come to light: we make the case for local distances and systems that leverage outside information to solve the general recognition problem.

Learning TSK-0 linguistic fuzzy rules by means of local search algorithms	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Linguistic fuzzy modeling; Evolutionary fuzzy systems; Machine learning; Metaheuristics-based machine learning; Local search	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; METHODOLOGY; SYSTEMS; CLASSIFIERS; ACCURACY; COR	Algorithms for deriving the rule base in Linguistic Fuzzy-Rule Based Systems usually proceed by selecting a set of candidate rules and, afterwards, finding both a subset of them and a combination of values for their consequents. Because of its cost, the latter process can be approached by using metaheuristic techniques such as genetic algorithms. However, existing works show that, if dealing with Mamdani rules - where the consequent is a linguistic label -, a basic local search clearly outperforms the genetic algorithm. In this work we aim to develop a local search algorithm to carry out the described process for the case of TSK-0 fuzzy rules, where the consequent is a real number. The experimental results show that some of the proposed algorithms clearly improve upon the state-of-the-art ones in terms of precision and number of rules, whereas learning times are fairly competitive and are orders of magnitude lower than those required by the genetic algorithm.

This is leading to increase in the use of the machine learning methods for analyzing and assessing public domain data sets. These methods can be used in developing models for estimating software quality attributes such as fault proneness, maintenance effort, testing effort. Software fault prediction in the early phases of software development can help and guide software practitioners to focus the available testing resources on the weaker areas during the software development. This paper analyses and compares the statistical and six machine learning methods for fault prediction. These methods (Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Cascade Correlation Network, Support Vector Machine, Group Method of Data Handling Method, and Gene Expression Programming) are empirically validated to find the relationship between the static code metrics and the fault proneness of a module. In order to assess and compare the models predicted using the regression and the machine learning methods we used two publicly available data sets AR1 and AR6. We compared the predictive capability of the models using the Area Under the Curve (measured from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis). The study confirms the predictive capability of the machine learning methods for software fault prediction. The results show that the Area Under the Curve of model predicted using the Decision Tree method is 0.8 and 0.9 (for AR1 and AR6 data sets, respectively) and is a better model than the model predicted using the logistic regression and other machine learning methods.

Can gamma-radiometrics predict soil textural data and stoniness in different parent materials? A comparison of two machine-learning methods	GEODERMA			English	Article						Support vector machines; Neural networks; Soil survey; Spectroscopy; Viticulture	PLANT-AVAILABLE POTASSIUM; NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; RAY SPECTROMETRY; REGRESSION; SPECTRA	The use of gamma-radiometrics for soil proximal sensing is strongly site specific, because of the influence of parent material mineralogy on the gamma-rays emitted from the soil. The work wants to propose a non-linear and multivariate computational approach to predict soil textural data and surficial stoniness based on gamma-spectroscopy. The gamma-spectroscopy survey was performed in heterogeneous soils in terms of parent material, pedogenesis, morphology, coarse material and moisture content. The gamma-radiometrics survey was performed by "The Mole" sensor (The Netherlands) and gamma-ray spectra were analysed by a Full Spectrum Analysis. 70 experimental points were described and classified according to parent material and surficial stoniness. The 70 experimental sites were also sampled during the gamma-ray survey and analysed for soil texture and moisture content An explorative PCA in the experimental points, based on the gamma-ray data and the elevation, showed 3 groups of cases, relating to the three groups of bedrock (i) calcareous flysch, (ii) feldspathic sandstone, and (iii) other lithologies, namely marly-shales, marine and fluvio-lacustrine deposits. Two machine learning models were used to predict sand, clay and surficial stoniness. The models were Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). An independent validation set of 20 soil samples was used to check the accuracy of the prediction models. Both SVM and ANN showed good prediction accuracy for sand and clay, although SVM showed the lowest errors. Both models showed lower accuracy for stoniness prediction, mainly due to high prediction errors in several sampling points. Probably, the high errors in stoniness prediction were due the strong heterogeneity of rock types and mineralogy. However, prediction model of stoniness spatial variability is very important in order to an adequate farming management (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A proper instantiation of a data structure can greatly impact the performance and the efficiency of the software system. In this paper we are focusing on the problem of customizing data structures instances during the execution of software systems using a supervised learning approach. In order to customize a data structure instance according to the software system's current execution context, a neural network will be used. We experimentally evaluated our technique on a case study, emphasizing the advantages of the proposed approach. The obtained experimental results highlight the potential of our proposal in using a supervised learning based approach for dynamically configuring data structures instances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

An SVM approach with electromagnetic methods to assess metal plate thickness	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Eddy current testing; ECT; Giant magneto resistance; GMR; Transient eddy current; Pulsed eddy current; Nondestructive testing; Support vector machine; SVM; Thickness measurement	EDDY-CURRENT SENSORS; DEFECT CLASSIFICATION	Eddy current testing (ECT) is a non-destructive technique that can be used in the measurement of conductive material thickness. In this work ECT and a machine learning algorithm (support vector machine - SVM) are used to determine accurately the thickness of metallic plates. The study has been made with ECT measurements on real specimens. At a first stage, a few number of plates is considered and SVM is used for a multi-class classification of the conductive plate thicknesses within a finite number of categories. Several figures of merit were tested to investigate the features that lead to "good" separating hyperplanes. Then, based on a SVM regressor, a reliable estimation of the thickness of a large quantity of plates is tested. Eddy currents are induced by imposing a voltage step in an excitation coil (transient eddy currents - TEC), while a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is the magnetic sensor that measures the transient magnetic field intensity in the sample vicinity. An experimental validation procedure, including machine training with linear and exponential kernels and classification errors, is presented with sets of samples with thicknesses up to 7.5 mm.

However, the usual approaches do not answer the question of what are appropriate representations to generate motion for a specific task. Since it is time-consuming for a human expert to manually design the motion control representation for a task, we propose to uncover such structure from data-observed motion trajectories. Inspired by Inverse Optimal Control, we present a novel method to learn a latent value function, imitate and generalize demonstrated behavior, and discover a task relevant motion representation. We test our method, called Task Space Retrieval Using Inverse Feedback Control (TRIC), on several challenging high-dimensional tasks. TRIC learns the important control dimensions for the tasks from a few example movements and is able to robustly generalize to new situations.

The concept of Non-Reducible Descriptors (NRDs) for binary features is introduced. NRDs are descriptors of patterns that do not contain any redundant information. They correspond to syndromes in medical diagnosis and are represented as conjunctions. The proposed approach is based on learning Boolean formulas. Combinatorial and decision-tree computational procedures for construction of all NRDs for a pattern are presented. The computational complexity of the proposed approach is discussed. The process of construction of all NRDs and the obtained NRDs are used for solving the binary feature selection problem. A procedure for combining classifiers is presented. The proposed approach is illustrated with applications for recognition of Arabic numerals in different graphical representations and recognition of QRS complexes in electrocardiograms. The obtained results are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Domain action classification is an essential part of a dialogue system because speakers' intentions are determined through the classification process. Although a domain action consists of a tightly associated speech act and a concept sequence, previous studies have independently dealt with speech acts and concept sequences in order to simplify the models, and this simplification has caused a decrease in performance. A retraining method for improving the domain action classification performance is proposed in order to resolve this problem. The proposed method divides a domain action classification model into a speech act classification model and a concept sequence classification model. The speech act classification model repeatedly uses concept sequence classification model outputs as inputs during training. In the experiments with goal-oriented dialogues, the proposed method exhibited a higher accuracy of 0.6% and higher macro F1-measure of 1.7% compared to the SVM and ME models that dealt with speech acts and concept sequences separately. Based on the experimental results, it was determined that the proposed method can improve the performance of some representative machine learning models for domain action classification.

In this paper, we present a single hidden-layer network TIClassRBM for invariant pattern recognition by incorporating linear transformations into discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine. In our model, invariant feature extraction and pattern classification can be implemented simultaneously. The mapping from input features to class label is represented by two groups of weights: transformed weights that connect hidden units to data, and pooling weights that connect pooling units yielded by probabilistic max-pooling to class label. All weights play an important role in the invariant pattern recognition. Moreover, TIClassRBM can handle general transformations contained in images, such as translation, rotation and scaling. The experimental studies on the variations of MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that the proposed model yields the best performance among some comparative models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When there are many products to screen (or many features to evaluate), it is rational for consumers-to use consider-then-choose decision processes and to do so with heuristic decision rules. Managerial decisions ( product development, marketing communications, etc.) depend upon the ability to identify and react to consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules. We provide managerial examples and review the state-of-the-art in the theory and measurement of consumers' heuristic consideration-set rules. Advances in greedoid methods, Bayesian inference, machine-learning, incentive alignment, measurement formats, and unstructured direct elicitation make it feasible and cost-effective to understand, quantify, and simulate "what-it" scenarios for a variety of heuristics. These methods now apply to a broad set of managerial problems including applications in complex product categories with large numbers of product features and feature-levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This adaptation leads to a nonlocal partial difference equation on graphs, which is an extension of the well-known approximations of the infinity Laplacian equation. To do so, we study the limit as p tends to infinity of minimizers of p-harmonic function on graphs. We also prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of this equation. Our motivation stems from the extension of the nonlocal infinity Laplacian equation from image processing to machine learning fields, with proposed illustrations for image inpainting and semi-supervised clustering.

A new approach based on Machine Learning for predicting corneal curvature (K1) and astigmatism in patients with keratoconus after intracorneal ring implantation	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Machine Learning; Keratoconus; Intracorneal rings; Astigmatism	SEGMENT IMPLANTATION; KERATECTASIA; TOPOGRAPHY; OUTCOMES; ECTASIA; LASIK	Keratoconus (KC) is the most common type of corneal ectasia. A corneal transplantation was the treatment of choice until the last decade. However, intra-corneal ring implantation has become more and more common, and it is commonly used to treat KC thus avoiding a corneal transplantation. This work proposes a new approach based on Machine Learning to predict the vision gain of KC patients after ring implantation. That vision gain is assessed by means of the corneal curvature and the astigmatism. Different models were proposed; the best results were achieved by an artificial neural network based on the Multilayer Perceptron. The error provided by the best model was 0.97D of corneal curvature and 0.93D of astigmatism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Valdes-Mas, M. A.; Ruperez, M.

Finding the location and size of an eye-pair in an image containing a face can enable a face recognition application to extract features from a face corresponding to different entities. Furthermore, it allows us to align different faces, so that more accurate recognition results can be obtained. To the best of our knowledge, currently there is only one eye-pair detector, which is a part of the Viola-Jones object detection framework. However, as we will show in this paper, this eye-pair detector is not very accurate for detecting eye-pairs from different face images. Therefore, in this paper we describe several novel eye-pair detection methods based on different feature extraction methods and a support vector machine (SVM) to classify image patches as containing an eye-pair or not. To find the location of an eye-pair on unseen test images, a sliding window approach is used, and the location and size of the window giving the highest output of the SVM classifier are returned. We have tested the different methods on three different datasets: the IMM, the Caltech and the Indian face dataset. The results show that the linear restricted Boltzmann machine feature extraction technique and principal component analysis result in the best performances. The SVM with these feature extraction methods is able to very accurately detect eye-pairs. Furthermore, the results show that our best eye-pair detection methods perform much better than the Viola-Jones eye-pair detector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A small number of these reported defects will be escalated by customers whose businesses are seriously impacted. Escalated defects must be resolved immediately and individually by the software vendors at a very high cost. The total costs can be even greater, including loss of reputation, satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat revenue. In this paper, we develop a Software defecT Escalation Prediction (STEP) system to mine historical defect report data and predict the escalation risk of current defect reports for maximum net profit. More specifically, we first describe a simple and general framework to convert the maximum net profit problem to cost-sensitive learning. We then apply and compare four well-known cost-sensitive learning approaches for STEP. Our experiments suggest that cost-sensitive decision trees (CSTree) is the best methods for producing the highest positive net profit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Classification of EU countries' progress towards sustainable development based on ordinal regression techniques	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sustainable development; European Union; Machine learning; Ordinal regression; Ensemble methods	INDICATORS; MODELS	Sustainable development (SD) is a major challenge for nations, even more so in the current economic crisis and uncertain environment. Although different indicators, compindices and rankings to measure and monitor SD advances at the macro level exist, the benefits for stakeholders and policy makers are still limited because of the absence of predictive models (in the sense of models able to classify countries according to their SD advances). To cope with this need, this paper presents a first approximation via machine learning techniques. First, we study the SD stage of the 27 European Union Member States using information from the years 2005-2010 and different major indicators that have been related to SD. A hierarchical clustering analysis is conducted, and the patterns are categorised as advanced, followers, moderate and initiated, according to their progress towards SD. The classification problem is addressed from an ordinal regression point of view because of the inherent order among the categories. To do so, a reformulation of the one-versus-all scheme for ordinal regression problems is used, making use of threshold models (Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines in this case) and a new trainable decision rule for probability estimation fusion. The empirical results indicate that the constructed model is able to achieve very promising and competitive performance. Thus, it could be used for monitoring the progress towards SD of the different EU countries, in a manner similar to that used for rankings.

Machine Learning for First-Order Theorem Proving Learning to Select a Good Heuristic	JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING			English	Article						Automatic theorem proving; Machine learning; First-order logic with equality; Feature selection; Support vector machines; Gaussian processes	GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES; SAT; CLASSIFICATION; PROVER	We applied two state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to the problem of selecting a good heuristic in a first-order theorem prover. Our aim was to demonstrate that sufficient information is available from simple feature measurements of a conjecture and axioms to determine a good choice of heuristic, and that the choice process can be automatically learned. Selecting from a set of 5 heuristics, the learned results are better than any single heuristic. The same results are also comparable to the prover's own heuristic selection method, which has access to 82 heuristics including the 5 used by our method, and which required additional human expertise to guide its design. One version of our system is able to decline proof attempts. This achieves a significant reduction in total time required, while at the same time causing only a moderate reduction in the number of theorems proved. To our knowledge no earlier system has had this capability.

The performance of this architecture is evaluated in a bootstrapping scenario emulating the development of Flyspeck from axioms to the last theorem, each time using only the previous theorems and proofs. It is shown that 39 % of the 14185 theorems could be proved in a push-button mode (without any high-level advice and user interaction) in 30 seconds of real time on a fourteen-CPU workstation. The necessary work involves: (i) an implementation of sound translations of the HOL Light logic to ATP formalisms: untyped first-order, polymorphic typed first-order, and typed higher-order, (ii) export of the dependency information from HOL Light and ATP proofs for the machine learners, and (iii) choice of suitable representations and methods for learning from previous proofs, and their integration as advisors with HOL Light. This work is described and discussed here, and an initial analysis of the body of proofs that were found fully automatically is provided.

ME is established based on the divide-and-conquer principle in which the problem space is divided between a few neural network experts, supervised by a gating network. In earlier works on ME, different strategies were developed to divide the problem space between the experts. To survey and analyse these methods more clearly, we present a categorisation of the ME literature based on this difference. Various ME implementations were classified into two groups, according to the partitioning strategies used and both how and when the gating network is involved in the partitioning and combining procedures. In the first group, The conventional ME and the extensions of this method stochastically partition the problem space into a number of subspaces using a special employed error function, and experts become specialised in each subspace. In the second group, the problem space is explicitly partitioned by the clustering method before the experts' training process starts, and each expert is then assigned to one of these sub-spaces. Based on the implicit problem space partitioning using a tacit competitive process between the experts, we call the first group the mixture of implicitly localised experts (MILE), and the second group is called mixture of explicitly localised experts (MELE), as it uses pre-specified clusters. The properties of both groups are investigated in comparison with each other. Investigation of MILE versus MELE, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each group, showed that the two approaches have complementary features. Moreover, the features of the ME method are compared with other popular combining methods, including boosting and negative correlation learning methods. As the investigated methods have complementary strengths and limitations, previous researches that attempted to combine their features in integrated approaches are reviewed and, moreover, some suggestions are proposed for future research directions.

The system uses fatiguing leaky integrate and fire neurons, a relatively coarse point model that roughly duplicates biological spiking properties; this allows spontaneous firing based on hypo-fatigue so that neurons not directly stimulated by the environment may be included in the circuit. A novel compensatory Hebbian learning algorithm is used that considers the total synaptic weight coming into a neuron. The network is unsupervised and entirely self-organising. This is relatively effective as a machine learning algorithm, categorising with just neurons, and the performance is comparable with a Kohonen map. However the learning algorithm is not stable, and behaviour decays as length of training increases. Variables including learning rate, inhibition and topology are explored leading to stable systems driven by the environment. The model is thus a reasonable next step toward a full neural memory model.

Correlating structure topological metrics with bulk composite properties via neural network analysis	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Homology; Topology; Stiffness; Microstructure; Machine learning; Data mining	GRAIN-BOUNDARY NETWORKS; MULTIPHASE MATERIALS; MULTISCALE MODEL	Given a database of any quantifiable set of cause and effect, machine learning methods can be trained to predict future effects based upon an assumed set of causes. In this paper, neural networks are trained to predict the bulk Young's modulus and electrical conductivity of a two-phase composite with high material property contrast, based upon a sample's microstructure. Various structure metrics are used to quantify the topological connectivity and disorder of analytically generated heterogeneous samples. The neural network is trained to predict the Young's modulus and coefficient of electrical conductivity based upon values calculated for a training set of samples using a finite element model. By repeating the process with various subset of structure metrics we can determine which metrics-or combination of metrics have the strongest influence in accurately predicting bulk material properties. Not only are neural net predictions of bulk properties in good agreement with calculated values for the 2D two-phase composites, but the insights into which metrics most strongly correlate with these properties (in this case, the connectivity metrics) may help focus the development of improved structure-property relations.

A metamodelling approach to estimate global N2O emissions from agricultural soils	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Aggregation; agriculture; climate change; global modelling; greenhouse gasses; metamodel; N2O emissions; random forest; soil data	NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; UNITED-STATES; MODEL; DAYCENT; AGGREGATION; METHODOLOGY; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; FERTILIZER	Aim Modelling complex environmental and ecological processes over large geographic areas is challenging, particularly when basic research and model development for such processes has historically been at the local scale. Moving from local toward global analysis brings up numerous issues related to data processing, aggregation, tradeoffs between model quality and data quality, and prioritization of data collection and/or compilation efforts. We studied these issues in the context of modelling emissions of N2O (a potent greenhouse gas) from agricultural soils. Location Global. Methods We developed metamodels of the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model, a mechanistic model that simulates greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils, to estimate global N2O emissions from maize and wheat fields. We ran DNDC for a diverse sample of global climate and soil types, and fitted the model output as a function of (sometimes simplified) model input variables, using the random forest machine learning algorithm. We used the metamodels to estimate global N2O emissions from maize and wheat at a very high spatial resolution (c. 1 km(2)) and examined the effects of different approaches of using soil data as well as the effects of spatial aggregation of soil and climate data. Results The average coefficient of determination (R-2) between holdout data (DNDC output not used to construct the metamodel) and metamodel predictions was 0.97 for maize and 0.91 for wheat. The metamodels were sensitive to soil properties, particularly to soil organic carbon content. Global emission estimates with the metamodel were highly sensitive to the spatial aggregation and other forms of generalization of soil data, but much less so to aggregation of climate data. Main conclusions Using a simplified metamodel with data of high spatial resolution could produce results that are more accurate than those obtained with a full mechanistic model and lower-resolution data.

J	Fathi, A; Mozaffari, A				Fathi, Alireza; Mozaffari, Ahmad			Vector optimization of laser solid freeform fabrication system using a hierarchical mutable smart bee-fuzzy inference system and hybrid NSGA-II/self-organizing map	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Laser solid freeform fabrication (LSFF); Mutable smart bee algorithm (MSBA); Vector optimization; Intelligent post optimization; Supervised hierarchical fuzzy training	GENETIC ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORK; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; COMPOSITES; PREDICTION	The purpose of current investigation is to develop a robust intelligent framework to achieve efficient and reliable operating process parameters for laser solid freeform fabrication (LSFF) process as a recent and ongoing topic of investigation. Firstly, based on mutable smart bee algorithm (MSBA) and fuzzy inference system (FIS) two models are developed to identify the clad hight (deposited layer thickness) and the melt pool depth as functions of scanning speed, laser power and mass powder. Using the obtained model, the well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for multi-criterion optimization of LSFF process. According to the available reported information and also the author's experiments, it is observed that the obtained Pareto front is not justifiable since it fails to cover the entire Pareto hyper-volume due to the lack of intensified exploration. To tackle this deficiency, authors execute a post optimization process through utilizing a competitive unsupervised machine learning approach known as self-organizing map (SOM) with cubic spatial topology. Achieved results indicate that this grid based network is capable of enhancing the intensification of Pareto solutions since its synaptic weights successfully imitate the characteristics of non-dominated solutions (optimal values of mass powder, laser power and scanning speed). For extracting the corresponding objective functions of these non-dominated synaptic weights, MSBA-FIS is used again to map the operating parameters to objective functions space. After the termination of abovementioned procedures, a valuable archive, containing a set of non-dominated solutions, is obtained which lets the authors to make a deliberate engineering trade-off. Simulation experiments reveal that the proposed intelligent framework is highly capable to cope with complex engineering systems. Besides, it is observed that MSBA is more efficient in evolving the structure of hierarchical fuzzy inference system in comparison with classic hierarchical GA-FIS model. This rises from the simple structure of MSBA that turns it into a fast and robust algorithm for handling constraint distributed systems (i.e. hierarchical FIS in current investigation). The obtained results also indicate that the introduced intelligent framework is applicable for optimal design of complex engineering systems where there exists no analytical formulation that describes the phenomenon as well as information of optimal operating parameters.

The objectives of this study were to examine the utility of the above for identifying LSI needs and compare different LSI-associated models, with the hypothesis that an ML model would be superior in performance over multivariate logistic regression models. One hundred four patients transported from the injury scene via helicopter were selected for the study. A wireless vital signs monitor was attached to the patient's arm and used to capture physiologic data, including HRV and HRC. The power of vital sign measurements, HRV, HRC, and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) to identify patients requiring LSIs was estimated using multivariate logistic regression and ML. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also obtained. Thirty-two patients underwent 75 LSIs. After logistic regression, ROC curves demonstrated better identification for LSIs using heart rate (HR) and HRC (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.81) than using HR alone (AUC of 0.73). Likewise, ROC curves demonstrated better identification for LSIs using GCS and HRC (AUC of 0.94) than using GCS and HR (AUC of 0.92). Importantly, ROC curves demonstrated that an ML model using HR, GCS, and HRC (AUC of 0.99) had superior performance over multivariate logistic regression models for identifying the need for LSIs in trauma patients. Development of computer decision support systems should utilize vital signs, HRC, and ML in order to achieve more accurate diagnostic capabilities, such as identification of needs for LSIs in trauma patients.

BosFinder: a novell pre-microRNA gene prediction algorithm in Bos taurus	ANIMAL GENETICS			English	Article						Cattle; miRNA; support vector machine	IDENTIFICATION; GENOMICS; REPRESSION; DISCOVERY; SEQUENCES; TARGETS; MIRBASE; TISSUES; MIRNAS; RNAS	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression transcriptionally (transcriptional activation or inactivation) and/or post-transcriptionally (translation inhibition or degradation of their target mRNAs). This phenomenon has significant roles in growth and developmental processes in plants and animals. Bos taurus is one of the most important livestock animals, having great importance in food and economical sciences and industries. However, limited information is available on Bos taurus constituent miRNAs because its whole genome assembly has been only recently published. Therefore, computational methods have been essential tools in miRNA gene prediction and discovery. Among these, machine-learning-based approaches are used to characterize genome scale pre-miRNAs from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). In this study, a support vector machine model was used to classify 33 structural and thermodynamic features of pre-miRNA genes. Public bovine EST data were obtained from different tissues in various developmental stages. A new algorithm, called BosFinder, was developed to identify and annotate the whole genome's derived pre-miRNAs. We found 18 776 highly potential pre-miRNA sequences. This is the first genome survey report of Bos taurus based on a machine-learning method for pre-miRNA gene finding.

The data provided cover the period between 3 January 2000 and 30 December 2011. A trading simulation is implemented so that statistical efficiency is complemented by measures of economic performance. The inputs retained are traditional technical trading rules commonly used in the analysis of equity markets such as Relative Strength Index, Moving Average Convergence Divergence, VIX and the daily return of the S&P 500. The SVM identifies the best situations in which to buy or sell in the market. The two outputs of the SVM are the movement of the market and the degree of set membership. The obtained results show that SVM using VIX produce better results than the Buy and Hold strategy or SVM without VIX.

Most often, extracting information from these data is key, in order to gain a better understanding of the processes that the data are describing. Learning from these data poses new challenges to traditional machine learning techniques, which are not typically designed to deal with data in which concepts and noise levels may vary over time. The purpose of this paper is to present supervised neural constructivist system (SNCS), an accuracy-based neural-constructivist learning classifier system that makes use of multilayer perceptrons to learn from data streams with a fast reaction capacity to concept changes. The behavior of SNCS on data stream problems with different characteristics is carefully analyzed and compared with other state-of-the-art techniques in the field. This comparison is also extended to a large collection of real-world problems. The results obtained show that SNCS can function in a variety of problem situations producing accurate classification of data, whether the data are static or in dynamic streams.

One of the main obstacles hindering the development and evaluation of such methods is the shortage of reference data sets. What is proposed in this work is a way of testing methods detecting network threats. It includes a procedure for creating realistic reference data sets describing network threats and the processing and use of these data sets in testing environments. The proposed approach is illustrated and validated on the basis of the problem of spam detection. Reference data sets for spam detection are developed, analysed and used to both generate the requested volume of simulated traffic and analyse it using machine learning algorithms. The tests take into account both the accuracy and performance of threat detection methods under real load and constrained computing resources.

Although multibeam echosounders enable us to map the seabed with high resolution and spatial accuracy, there is still a lack of fit-for-purpose seabed maps. This is due to the high costs involved in carrying out systematic seabed mapping programmes and the fact that the development of validated, repeatable, quantitative and objective methods of swath acoustic data interpretation is still in its infancy. We compared a wide spectrum of approaches including manual interpretation, geostatistics, object-based image analysis and machine-learning to gain further insights into the accuracy and comparability of acoustic data interpretation approaches based on multibeam echosounder data (bathymetry, backscatter and derivatives) and seabed samples with the aim to derive seabed substrate maps. Sample data were split into a training and validation data set to allow us to carry out an accuracy assessment. Overall thematic classification accuracy ranged from 67% to 76% and Cohen's kappa varied between 0.34 and 0.52. However, these differences were not statistically significant at the 5% level. Misclassifications were mainly associated with uncommon classes, which were rarely sampled. Map outputs were between 68% and 87% identical. To improve classification accuracy in seabed mapping, we suggest that more studies on the effects of factors affecting the classification performance as well as comparative studies testing the performance of different approaches need to be carried out with a view to developing guidelines for selecting an appropriate method for a given dataset. In the meantime, classification accuracy might be improved by combining different techniques to hybrid approaches and multi-method ensembles. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, strong artificial intelligence (AI) became important and, thus, statistical machine learning (ML) methods were applied to serve it. These methods are very difficult to understand, and they predict the future without showing how. However, understanding of how machines make their decision is also important, especially in information system domain. Consequently, incremental covering algorithms (CA) can be used to produce simple rules to make difficult decisions. Nevertheless, even though using simple CA as the base of strong AI agent would be a novel idea but doing so with themethods available in CA is not possible. It was found that having to accurately update the discovered rules based on new information in CA is a challenge and needs extra attention. In specific, incomplete data with missing classes is inappropriately considered, whereby the speed and data size was also a concern, and future none existing classes were neglected. Consequently, this paper will introduce a novel algorithm called RULES-IT, in order to solve the problems of incremental CA and introduce it into strong AI. This algorithm is the first incremental algorithm in its family, and CA as a whole, that transfer rules of different domains to improve the performance, generalize the induction, take advantage of past experience in different domain, and make the learner more intelligent. It is also the first to introduce intelligent aspects into incremental CA, including consciousness, subjective emotions, awareness, and adjustment. Furthermore, all decisions made can be understood due to the simple representation of repository as rules. Finally, RULES-IT performance will be benchmarked with six different methods and compared with its predecessors to see the effect of transferring rules in the learning process, and to prove how RULES-IT actually solved the shortcoming of current incremental CA in addition to its improvement in the total performance.

Here, we report H-DROP, an SVM-based Helical Domain linker pRediction using OPtimal features. H-DROP is, to the best of our knowledge, the first predictor for specifically and effectively identifying helical linkers. This was made possible first because a large training dataset became available from IS-Dom, and second because we selected a small number of optimal features from a huge number of potential ones. The training helical linker dataset, which included 261 helical linkers, was constructed by detecting helical residues at the boundary regions of two independent structural domains listed in our previously reported IS-Dom dataset. 45 optimal feature candidates were selected from 3,000 features by random forest, which were further reduced to 26 optimal features by stepwise selection. The prediction sensitivity and precision of H-DROP were 35.2 and 38.8 %, respectively. These values were over 10.7 % higher than those of control methods including our previously developed DROP, which is a coil linker predictor, and PPRODO, which is trained with un-differentiated domain boundary sequences. Overall, these results indicated that helical linkers can be predicted from sequence information alone by using a strictly curated training data set for helical linkers and carefully selected set of optimal features.

A rapid and objective evaluation of tarhana quality by assessing the used drying method is important for producers and packaging companies. A computer vision method was developed to discriminate between drying methods of tarhana. Tarhana samples were prepared with three drying methods: sun dried, oven dried and microwave dried. An image acquisition station was constituted under artificial illumination. Different types of machine learning methods and feature selection methods were tested to find an effective system for the discrimination between drying methods of tarhana using visual texture features with different color components. Experimental results showed that the best accuracy rate (99.5%) was achieved with a K-nearest-neighbors classifier through the feature model based on stepwise discriminant analysis.

Semi-CRFs put the label to a segment not a single word which is more natural than the other machine learning methods such as conditional random fields model (CRFs). Our approach divides the biomedical named entity recognition task into two sub-tasks: term boundary detection and semantic labeling. At the first phase, term boundary detection sub-task detects the boundary of the entities and classifies the entities into one type C. At the second phase, semantic labeling sub-task labels the entities detected at the first phase the correct entity type. We explore novel feature sets at both phases to improve the performance. To make a comparison, experiments conducted both on CRFs and on semi-CRFs models at each phase. Our experiments carried out on JNLPBA 2004 datasets achieve an F-score of 74.64 % based on semi-CRFs without deep domain knowledge and post-processing algorithms, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems.

It is particularly interesting when it is easy to project onto each separate set, but nontrivial to project onto their intersection. Algorithms based on Newton's method such as the interior point method are viable for small to medium-scale problems. However, modern applications in statistics, engineering, and machine learning are posing problems with potentially tens of thousands of parameters or more. We revisit this convex programming problem and propose an algorithm that scales well with dimensionality. Our proposal is an instance of a sequential unconstrained minimization technique and revolves around three ideas: the majorization-minimization principle, the classical penalty method for constrained optimization, and quasi-Newton acceleration of fixed-point algorithms. The performance of our distance majorization algorithms is illustrated in several applications.

Three micro electro-mechanical system accelerometers were mounted on the suprasternal notch, thorax and abdomen of subjects in supine, prone and lateral positions to record the upper airway acceleration and the movements of the chest and abdomen wall. The respiratory flow and efforts were estimated from the recorded acceleration signals by applying machine learning methods. To assess the agreement of the estimated signals with the well-established measurement methods, standard error of measurement (SEM) was calculated and was estimated for every condition. A significant agreement between the estimated and reference signals was found ( and 0.89 for the estimated flow, thorax and abdomen efforts respectively). Additionally, the agreement of the estimated and reference flows was assessed by calculating the ratio of time at the tidal peak inspiration flow to the inspiration time () and the ratio of time at the tidal peak expiration flow to the expiration time (). Overall mean and standard deviation of absolute value of differences between and ratios calculated for every breathing cycle of reference and estimated flow were 0.0035 (0.06) and 0.051 (0.032), respectively. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of using the upper-body acceleration as a simple solution for long-term monitoring of respiratory features.

A framework was designed to integrate two remotely sensed datasets and four data processing techniques. Lidar elevation and intensity features were extracted from the original point cloud data to avoid the errors and uncertainties in the roster-based lidar, methods. Lidar significantly increased the classification accuracy compared with the application of hyperspectral data alone. Three lidar-derived features (elevation, intensity, and topography) had the same contributions in the classification. A synergy of hyperspectral imagery with all lidar-derived features achieved the best result with on overall accuracy of 86 percent and a Kappa value of 0.82 based on an ensemble analysis of three machine learning classifiers. Ensemble analysis did not significantly increase the classification accuracy, but it provided a complemental), uncertainty map for the final classified mop. The study shows the promise of the synergy of hyperspectral and lidar systems for mapping complex wetlands.

J	Tsourakis, N				Tsourakis, Nikos			Using hand gestures to control mobile spoken dialogue systems	UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY			English	Article						Gestured-controlled mobile applications; Gesture and speech interfaces; Gesture classification; Mobile accessibility	ACCELEROMETER; INTERFACE; SPEECH	Speech and hand gestures offer the most natural modalities for everyday human-to-human interaction. The availability of diverse spoken dialogue applications and the proliferation of accelerometers on consumer electronics allow the introduction of new interaction paradigms based on speech and gestures. Little attention has been paid, however, to the manipulation of spoken dialogue systems (SDS) through gestures. Situation-induced disabilities or real disabilities are determinant factors that motivate this type of interaction. In this paper, six concise and intuitively meaningful gestures are proposed that can be used to trigger the commands in any SDS. Using different machine learning techniques, a classification error for the gesture patterns of less than 5 % is achieved, and the proposed set of gestures is compared to ones proposed by users. Examining the social acceptability of the specific interaction scheme, high levels of acceptance for public use are encountered. An experiment was conducted comparing a button-enabled and a gesture-enabled interface, which showed that the latter imposes little additional mental and physical effort. Finally, results are provided after recruiting a male subject with spastic cerebral palsy, a blind female user, and an elderly female person.

J	Gagne, DJ; McGovern, A; Xue, M				Gagne, David John, II; McGovern, Amy; Xue, Ming			Machine Learning Enhancement of Storm-Scale Ensemble Probabilistic Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article							PREDICTION SYSTEM ARPS; NONHYDROSTATIC ATMOSPHERIC SIMULATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; PART II; MODEL; VERIFICATION; WEATHER; SKILL; CALIBRATION; NEIGHBORHOOD	Probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts challenge meteorologists due to the wide variability of precipitation amounts over small areas and their dependence on conditions at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Ensembles of convection-allowing numerical weather prediction models offer a way to produce improved precipitation forecasts and estimates of the forecast uncertainty. These models allow for the prediction of individual convective storms on the model grid, but they often displace the storms in space, time, and intensity, which results in added uncertainty. Machine learning methods can produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts from the raw ensemble data that correct for systemic biases in the ensemble precipitation forecast and incorporate additional uncertainty information from aggregations of the ensemble members and additional model variables. This study utilizes the 2010 Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms Storm-Scale Ensemble Forecast system and the National Severe Storms Laboratory National Mosaic & Multi-Sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimate as input data for training logistic regressions and random forests to produce a calibrated probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast. The reliability and discrimination of the forecasts are compared through verification statistics and a case study.

J	Watson, RA				Watson, Robert A.			Use of a Machine Learning Algorithm to Classify Expertise: Analysis of Hand Motion Patterns During a Simulated Surgical Task	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							QUANTIFICATION; MOVEMENT; SKILL; SCORE	Purpose To test the hypothesis that machine learning algorithms increase the predictive power to classify surgical expertise using surgeons' hand motion patterns. Method In 2012 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 14 surgical attendings and 10 first-and second-year surgical residents each performed two bench model venous anastomoses. During the simulated tasks, the participants wore an inertial measurement unit on the dorsum of their dominant (right) hand to capture their hand motion patterns. The pattern from each bench model task performed was preprocessed into a symbolic time series and labeled as expert (attending) or novice (resident). The labeled hand motion patterns were processed and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The trained algorithm was then tested for discriminative/predictive power against unlabeled (blinded) hand motion patterns from tasks not used in the training. The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity metric was also measured from each hand motion pattern, with an optimal threshold calculated to separately classify the patterns. Results The LZ metric classified unlabeled (blinded) hand motion patterns into expert and novice groups with an accuracy of 70% (sensitivity 64%, specificity 80%). The SVM algorithm had an accuracy of 83% (sensitivity 86%, specificity 80%). Conclusions The results confirmed the hypothesis. The SVM algorithm increased the predictive power to classify blinded surgical hand motion patterns into expert versus novice groups. With further development, the system used in this study could become a viable tool for low-cost, objective assessment of procedural proficiency in a competency-based curriculum.

In this work, we present a method for predicting the fatty acid (FA)-binding residues by using three-dimensional probability density distributions of interacting atoms of FAs on protein surfaces which are derived from the known protein-FA complex structures. A machine learning algorithm was established to learn the characteristic patterns of the probability density maps specific to the FA-binding sites. The predictor was trained with five-fold cross validation on a non-redundant training set and then evaluated with an independent test set as well as on holo-apo pair's dataset. The results showed good accuracy in predicting the FA-binding residues.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the current study, we proposed a synthetic pipeline to automatically model and predict the acute toxicity of chemicals to algae. In the procedure, a new alignment-free three dimensional (3D) structure characterization method was described and, with this method, several 3D-quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (3D-QSTR) models were developed, from which two were found to exhibit strong internal fitting ability and high external predictive power. The best model was established by Gaussian process (GP), which was further employed to perform extrapolation on a random compound library consisting of 1014 virtually generated substituted benzenes. It was found that (i) substitution number can only exert slight influence on chemical's toxicity, but low-substituted benzenes seem to have higher toxicity than those of high-substituted entities, and (ii) benzenes substituted by nitro group and halogens exhibit high acute toxicity as compared to other substituents such as methyl and carboxyl groups. Subsequently, several promising candidates suggested by computational prediction were assayed by using a standard algal growth inhibition test. Consequently, four substituted benzenes, namely 2,3-dinitrophenol, 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline, 1,2,3-trinitrobenzene and 3-bromophenol, were determined to have high acute toxicity to Scenedesmus obliquus, with their EC50 values of 2.5 +/- 0.8, 10.5 +/- 2.1, 1.4 +/- 0.2 and 42.7 +/- 5.4 mu mol/L, respectively.

J	Bou-Harb, E; Lakhdari, NE; Binsalleeh, H; Debbabi, M				Bou-Harb, Elias; Lakhdari, Nour-Eddine; Binsalleeh, Hamad; Debbabi, Mourad			Multidimensional investigation of source port 0 probing	DIGITAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Port 0 probing; Darknet; Malware; Passive DNS; Data correlation		During November 2013, the operational cyber/network security community reported an unprecedented increase of traffic originating from source port 0. This event was deemed as malicious although its core aim and mechanism were obscured. This paper investigates that event using a multifaceted approach that leverages three real network security feeds that we receive on a daily basis, namely, darknet, passive DNS and malware data. The goal is to analyze such event from the perspectives of those feeds in order to generate significant insights and inferences that could contribute to disclosing the inner details of that incident. The approach extracts and subsequently fingerprints such malicious traffic from the received darknet data. By executing unsupervised machine learning techniques on the extracted traffic, we disclose clusters of activities that share similar machinery. Further, by employing a set of statistical-based behavioral analytics, we capture the mechanisms of those clusters, including their strategies, techniques and nature. We consequently correlate the sources with passive DNS in order to investigate their maliciousness. Moreover, to examine if the sources are malware contaminated, we execute a correlation mechanism between the darknet data and the malware feeds. The outcome reveals that such traffic indeed is reconnaissance/probing activities originating from three different horizontal scans utilizing packets with a TCP header length of 0 or packets with odd flag combinations. The results as well demonstrate that 28% of the scanning sources host malicious/blacklisted domains as they are often used for spamming, phishing and other fraud activities. Additionally, the outcome portrays that the bot probing sources are infected by 'Virus.Win32.Sality'. By correlating various evidence, we confirm that such malware specimen is in fact responsible for part of the source port 0 probing event. We concur that this work is a first attempt ever to comprehend the machinery of such unique event and we hope that the community could consider it as a building block for auxiliary analysis and investigation.

AF is a mycotoxin that may cause liver cancer when consumed in amounts higher than allowed limits. Figs, like other agricultural products, are mostly affected by AF-producing moulds and these moulds usually produce kojic acid together with AF. Kojic acid is a fluorescent compound and exhibiting bright greenish yellow fluorescence (BGYF) under ultraviolet (UV) light. Using this fluorescence property, fig-processing plants manually select and remove the BGYF+ figs to reduce the AF level of the processed figs. Although manual selection is based on subjective criteria and strongly depends on the expertise level of the workers, it is known as the most effective way of removing AF-contaminated samples. However, during manual selection, workers are exposed to UV radiation and this brings skin health problems. In this study, we individually investigated the figs to measure their fluorescence level, surface mould concentration and AF levels and noted a strong correlation between mould concentration and BGYF and AF, and BGYF and surface. In addition to a pairwise correlation, we proposed a machine-vision and machine-learning approach to detect the AF-contaminated figs using their multispectral images under UV light. The figs were classified in two different approaches considering their surface mould and AF level with error rates of 9.38% and 11.98%, respectively.

For example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will begin operations in northern Chile in 2022, will generate a nearly 150 Petabyte imaging dataset of the southern hemisphere sky. The LSST will stream data at rates of 2 Terabytes per hour, effectively capturing an unprecedented movie of the sky. The LSST is expected not only to improve our understanding of time-varying astrophysical objects, but also to reveal a plethora of yet unknown faint and fast-varying phenomena. To cope with a change of paradigm to data-driven astronomy, the fields of astroinformatics and astrostatistics have been created recently. The new data-oriented paradigms for astronomy combine statistics, data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to provide the automated and robust methods needed for the rapid detection and classification of known astrophysical objects as well as the unsupervised characterization of novel phenomena. In this article we present an overview of machine learning and computational intelligence applications to TDA. Future big data challenges and new lines of research in TDA, focusing on the LSST, are identified and discussed from the viewpoint of computational intelligence/machine learning. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be required to cope with the challenges posed by the deluge of astronomical data coming from the LSST.

Generally, the method used for IIF analysis remains subjective, and depends too heavily on the experience and expertise of the physician. Recently, studies have shown that it is possible to identify the cell patterns using IIF image analysis and machine learning techniques. However, it still has large gap in recognition rates to the physical experts' one. This paper explores an approach in which the discriminative features of HEp-2 cell images in IIF are extracted and then, the patterns of the HEp-2 cell are identified using machine learning techniques. Motivated by the progress in the research field of computer vision, as a result of which small local pixel pattern distributions can now be highly discriminative, the proposed strategy employs a parametric probability process to model local image patches (textons: microstructures in the cell image) and extract the higher-order statistics of the model parameters for the image description. The proposed strategy can adaptively characterize the microtexton space of HEp-2 cell images as a generative probability model, and discover the parameters that yield a better fitting of the training space, which would lead to a more discriminant representation for the cell image. The simple linear support vector machine is used for cell pattern identification because of its low computational cost, in particular for large-scale datasets. Experiments using the open HEp-2 cell dataset used in the ICIP2013 contest validate that the proposed strategy can achieve a much better performance than the widely used local binary pattern (LBP) histogram and its extensions, rotation invariant co-occurrence LBP, and pair wise rotation invariant co-occurrence LBP, and that the achieved recognition error rate is even very significantly below the observed intralaboratory variability.

Classification of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MR Images of Cervical Cancers Using Texture Analysis and Support Vector Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Cervix; machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); pattern recognition and classification	HETEROGENEITY; PARAMETERS; RADIOTHERAPY; CARCINOMA; KINETICS; CHEMORADIOTHERAPY; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; BIOMARKER; FEATURES	Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides insight into the vascular properties of tissue. Pharmacokinetic models may be fitted to DCE-MRI uptake patterns, enabling biologically relevant interpretations. The aim of our study was to determine whether treatment outcome for 81 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer could be predicted from parameters of the Brix pharmacokinetic model derived from pre-chemoradiotherapy DCE-MRI. First-order statistical features of the Brix parameters were used. In addition, texture analysis of Brix parameter maps was done by constructing gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) from the maps. Clinical factors and first- and second-order features were used as explanatory variables for support vector machine (SVM) classification, with treatment outcome as response. Classification models were validated using leave-one-out cross-model validation. A random value permutation test was used to evaluate model significance. Features derived from first-order statistics could not discriminate between cured and relapsed patients (specificity 0%-20%, p-values close to unity). However, second-order GLCM features could significantly predict treatment outcome with accuracies (similar to 70%) similar to the clinical factors tumor volume and stage (69%). The results indicate that the spatial relations within the tumor, quantified by texture features, were more suitable for outcome prediction than first-order features.

J	Yurur, O; Labrador, M; Moreno, W				Yurur, Ozgur; Labrador, Miguel; Moreno, Wilfrido			Adaptive and Energy Efficient Context Representation Framework in Mobile Sensing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						Mobile sensing; ubiquitous sensing; energy efficiency; context-awareness; machine learning; inhomogeneous hidden markov chain; adaptability	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM	This paper presents a novel framework that includes an inhomogeneous (time-variant) Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and learning from data concepts. The framework either recognizes or estimates user contextual inferences called 'user states' within the concept of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) for future context-aware applications. Context-aware applications require continuous data acquisition and interpretation from one or more sensor reading(s). Therefore, device battery lifetimes need to be extended due to the fact that constantly running built-in sensors deplete device batteries rapidly. In this sense, a framework is constructed to fulfill requirements needed by applications and to prolong device battery lifetimes. The ultimate goal of this paper is to present an accurate user state representation model, and to maximize power efficiency while the model operates. Most importantly, this research intends to create and clarify a generic framework to guide the development of future context-aware applications. Moreover, topics such as user profile adaptability and variant sensory sampling operations are examined. The proposed framework is validated by simulations and implemented in a HAR-based application by the smartphone accelerometer. According to the results, the proposed framework shows an increase in power efficiency of 60% for an accuracy range from 75% up to 96%, depending on user profiles.

Unfortunately, the energy demands of newer ambient intelligence and collaborative technologies on mobile devices have greatly overwhelmed modern energy storage abilities. This paper proposes several novel techniques that exploit spatiotemporal and device context to predict device wireless data and location interface configurations that can optimize energy consumption in mobile devices. These techniques, which include variants of linear discriminant analysis, linear logistic regression, non-linear logistic regression with neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machines are explored and compared on synthetic and user traces from real-world usage studies. The experimental results show that up to 90% successful prediction is possible with neural networks and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, improving upon prediction strategies in prior work by approximately 50%. Further, an average improvement of 24% energy savings is achieved compared to state-of-the-art prior work on energy-efficient location-sensing.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the utility of unsupervised feature learning in the context of modeling expressive dynamics, in particular note intensities of performed music. We use a note centric representation of musical contexts, which avoids shortcomings of existing musical representations. With that representation, we perform experiments in which learned features are used to predict note intensities. The experiments are done using a data set comprising professional performances of Chopin's complete piano repertoire. For feature learning we use Restricted Boltzmann machines, and contrast this with features learned using matrix decomposition methods. We evaluate the results both quantitatively and qualitatively, identifying salient learned features, and discussing their musical relevance.

It addresses an important limitation of many existing methods, whose solutions do not achieve effective propagation of the constraint information to unconstrained samples. We overcome this limitation by constraining the solution to comport with a smooth (soft) class partition of the feature space, which necessarily entails constraint propagation and generalization to unconstrained samples. This is achieved via a parameterized mean-field approximation to the posterior distribution over component assignments, with the parameterization chosen to match the representation power of the chosen (generative) mixture density family. Unlike many existing methods, our method flexibly models classes using a variable number of components, which allows it to learn complex class boundaries. Also, unlike most of the methods, ours estimates the number of latent classes present in the data. Experiments on synthetic data and data sets from the UC Irvine machine learning repository show that, overall, our method achieves significant improvements in classification performance compared with the existing methods.

Perceptual Annotation: Measuring Human Vision to Improve Computer Vision	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; psychology; visual recognition; face detection; support vector machines; regularization; citizen science; psychophysics; psychometrics	FACE RECOGNITION; INDIVIDUALS	For many problems in computer vision, human learners are considerably better than machines. Humans possess highly accurate internal recognition and learning mechanisms that are not yet understood, and they frequently have access to more extensive training data through a lifetime of unbiased experience with the visual world. We propose to use visual psychophysics to directly leverage the abilities of human subjects to build better machine learning systems. First, we use an advanced online psychometric testing platform to make new kinds of annotation data available for learning. Second, we develop a technique for harnessing these new kinds of information-"perceptual annotations"-for support vector machines. A key intuition for this approach is that while it may remain infeasible to dramatically increase the amount of data and high-quality labels available for the training of a given system, measuring the exemplar-by-exemplar difficulty and pattern of errors of human annotators can provide important information for regularizing the solution of the system at hand. A case study for the problem face detection demonstrates that this approach yields state-of-the-art results on the challenging FDDB data set.

Two corpora of recent annual reports are examined and compared, one in English and one in Chinese. The paper tests whether vocabularies can predict whether firms are relatively innovative or not, examining vocabularies of both content words and function words. We find that indeed the tested vocabularies do produce effective indicators or classifiers and, surprisingly, that function words are especially effective. The paper also provides extensive conceptual and theoretical background to frame the investigation in the context of an EMCUT problematic, that of mapping entities to classification schemes using information derived from text.

More specifically, we introduce a criterion that allows to learn a cost function which tends to produce large distance values for elements belonging to different classes and small distance values for elements belonging to the same class. Under some additional constraints (one of them being the well-known Monge condition), we show that the optimization of this criterion writes as a linear programming problem. Experimental results on synthetic data show that the output optimal cost function provides good retrieval performances in the presence of two types of perturbations commonly found in histograms. When compared to a set of various commonly used cost functions, our optimal cost function performs as good as the best cost function of the set, which shows that it can adapt well to the task. Promising results are also obtained on real data for two-class image retrieval based on grayscale intensity histograms.

Classical supervised learning techniques require labeling of the intensities, which is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge, but nevertheless is not guaranteed to be objective. We propose a new approach to learn an intensity rating function which does not require expert knowledge, because it simplifies the labeling task by avoiding the difficulty of selecting an absolute intensity value and to keep the labeling consistent for the whole dataset. It is based on a novel kind of ground truth which we call Comparative Labeling. It specifies sample pairs for which the first element is desired to have a lower intensity than the second. We introduce a learning scheme to find an optimal intensity function in respect of the Comparative Labeling and propose performance measures to assess the quality of the learned function. The technique is applied to rate the intensity of facial expressions of posed pain. The evaluation results show that the learned function is well suited for determining dynamic intensity variation over time. We also assess the suitability of the rating as an inter-individual intensity measure by comparing it to the intensity ratings given by human observers.

Keyphrase assignment is the alignment of documents or text with keyphrases of any standard taxonomy/classification system. Kea++ is an automatic keyphrase assignment tool using a machine learning-based technique. However, it does not effectively exploit the hierarchical relations that exist in its input taxonomy and returns noise in its results. The refinement methodology was designed as a top layer of Kea++ in order to fine tune its results. It was an initial step and focused on a single Computing domain. It was neither validated on multiple domains nor evaluated to determine whether the improvement in the results is significant or not. The aim of this task was to solidify the refinement methodology. The main contributions of this work are (a) to extend the methodology for multiple domains and (b) to statistically verify that the improvement in the Kea++ results is significant.

This makes it important to analyse collaborative research ties. Traditional methods to indicate the extent of collaboration between organizations use co-authorship data in citation databases. Publication data from these databases are not publicly available and can be expensive to access and so hyperlink data has been proposed as an alternative. This paper investigates whether using machine learning methods to filter page types can improve the extent to which hyperlink data can be used to indicate the extent of collaboration between universities. Structured information about research projects extracted from UK and EU funding agency websites, co-authored publications and academic links between universities were analysed to identify if there is any association between the number of hyperlinks connecting two universities, with and without machine learning filtering, and the number of publications they co-authored. An increased correlation was found between the number of inlinks to a university's website and the extent to which it collaborates with other universities when machine learning techniques were used to filter out apparently irrelevant inlinks.

Limited temporal resolution of satellite images and cloudy skies present major limitations that impede continuous estimates of ET. This study introduces a practical approach that overcomes (in part) the previous limitations by implementing machine learning techniques that are accurate and robust. The analysis was applied to the Canal B service area of the Delta Canal Company in central Utah using data from the 2009-2011 growing seasons. Actual ET was calculated by an algorithm using data from satellite images. A relevance vector machine (RVM), which is a sparse Bayesian regression, was used to build a spatial model for ET. The RVM was trained with a set of inputs consisting of vegetation indexes, crops, and weather data. ET estimated via the algorithm was used as an output. The developed RVM model provided an accurate estimation of spatial ET based on a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) of 0.84 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.5mmday-1. This methodology lays the groundwork for estimating ET at a spatial scale for the days when a satellite image is not available.

As we move through an environment, we are constantly making assessments, judgments and decisions about the things we encounter. Some are acted upon immediately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions-our implicit 'labeling' of the world. In this paper, we use physiological correlates of this labeling to construct a hybrid brain-computer interface (hBCI) system for efficient navigation of a 3D environment. Approach. First, we record electroencephalographic (EEG), saccadic and pupillary data from subjects as they move through a small part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate the neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective interest to them. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using semi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to the labeled ones. Finally, the system plots an efficient route to help the subjects visit the 'similar' objects it identifies. Main results. We show that by exploiting the subjects' implicit labeling to find objects of interest instead of exploring naively, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the median subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that the neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers' inference of subjects' implicit labeling. Significance. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of objects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting in an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests.

Incapable of identifying suspicious records in CTG data using ANN based machine learning techniques	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Cardiotocography; fetal heart rate; SVM; ANN; Fuzzy c-mean; k-mean clustering		Cardiotocography (CTG) is a simultaneous recording of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions (UC). It is one of the most common diagnostic techniques to evaluate maternal and fetal well-being during pregnancy and before delivery. By observing the Cardiotocography trace patterns doctors can understand the state of the fetus. We implement a model based CTG data classification system using a supervised artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) which can classify the CTG data based on its training data. The performance neural network based classification model has been compared with the most commonly used unsupervised clustering methods Fuzzy C-mean and k-mean clustering and supervised clustering method SVM classification. According to the arrived results, the performance of the supervised machine learning based classification (ANN) approach provided significant performance than other compared unsupervised clustering methods and supervised SVM classification method. We used Precision, Recall, F-Measure and Rand Index as the metric to evaluate the performance. Even though the traditional clustering methods can identify the Normal CTG patterns, they were incapable of finding Suspicious and Pathologic patterns and the SVM based classifier provided good performance, it was absolutely incapable of identifying a single suspicious record. It was found that, the ANN based classifier was capable of identifying Normal, Suspicious and Pathologic condition, from the nature of CTG data with very good accuracy. The important finding in this paper is Even though SVM is a well proven technique for classification, it was incapable of identifying Suspicious Records in Cardiotocogram Data - but ANN did considerably good classification of Suspicious Records.

Contrary to what might be expected, the models derived from the CheqSol experimental data are not more accurate than those derived from the "noisy" literature data. The results suggest that, at the present time, it is the deficiency of QSPR methods (algorithms and/or descriptor sets), and not, as is commonly quoted, the uncertainty in the experimental measurements, which is the limiting factor in accurately predicting aqueous solubility for pharmaceutical molecules.

To accommodate increased service demand and load on rail networks, increase in network velocity, without compromising safety, is required. Among many determinants of overall network velocity, a key driver is service interruption, including lowered operating speed due to track/train condition and delays caused by derailments. Railroads have put significant infrastructure and inspection programs in place to avoid service interruptions. One of the key measures is an extensive network of wayside mechanical condition detectors (temperature, strain, vision, infrared, weight, impact, etc.) that monitor the rolling-stock as it passes by. The detectors are designed to alert for conditions that either violate regulations set by governmental rail safety agencies or deteriorating rolling-stock conditions as determined by the railroad. Using huge volumes of historical detector data, in combination with failure data, maintenance action data, inspection schedule data, train type data and weather data, we are exploring several analytical approaches including, correlation analysis, causal analysis, time series analysis and machine learning techniques to automatically learn rules and build failure prediction models. These models will be applied against both historical and real-time data to predict conditions leading to failure in the future, thus avoiding service interruptions and increasing network velocity. Additionally, the analytics and models can also be used for detecting root cause of several failure modes and wear rate of components, which, while do not directly address network velocity, can be proactively used by maintenance organizations to optimize trade-offs related to maintenance schedule, costs and shop capacity. As part of our effort, we explore several avenues to machine learning techniques including distributed learning and hierarchical analytical approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, there are now many potential applications that involve aspects of both recommendation and information retrieval, and the task of collaborative retrieval-a combination of these two traditional problems-has recently been introduced. Successful collaborative retrieval requires overcoming severe data sparsity, making additional sources of information, such as social graphs, particularly valuable. In this paper we propose a new model for collaborative retrieval, and show that our algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by incorporating information from social networks. We also provide empirical analyses of the ways in which cultural interests propagate along a social graph using a real-world music dataset.

This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm for compliant motion control of continuum robots subjected to multiple unknown contacts with the environment. A mapping of external wrenches to a generalized force in the configuration space of a multisegment continuum robot is presented and related to measured joint-level actuation forces. These measurements are applied as inputs to a low-level compliant motion controller. Friction and modeling uncertainties, presenting an unknown nonlinear deviation from the nominal system model, are corrected via a feed-forward estimate provided by a support vector machine. The controller is evaluated on (sic)9 and (sic)5 mm multisegment continuum robots. We quantify the minimal interaction forces needed to generate compliant motion and demonstrate the ability of the controller to minimize interaction forces during insertion through tortuous passages.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short, single-stranded RNAs that regulate protein expression in a post-transcriptional manner, have recently been demonstrated to contribute to IPF pathogene,sis. We have previously identified WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) as a highly expressed pro-fibrotic mediator in IPF, but the underlying mechanisms resulting in increased WISP1 expression, remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether WISP1 is a target of miRNA regulation. We applied a novel supervised machine learning approach, which predicted miR-30a/d and miR-92a target sites in regions of the human WISP1 3'UTR preferentially bound by the miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex. Both miRNAs were decreased in IPF samples, whereas WISP1 protein was increased. We demonstrated further that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1-induced WISP1 expression in primary lung fibroblasts in vitro and lung homogenates in vivo. Notably, miR-30a and miR-92a reversed TGF-beta 1-induced WISP1 mRNA expression in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, miR-92a inhibition increased WISP1 protein expression in lung fibroblasts. An inverse relationship for WISP1 and miR-92a was found in a TGF-beta 1 dependent lung fibrosis model in vivo. Finally, we found significantly increased WISP1 expression in primary IPF fibroblasts, which negatively correlated with miR-92a level ex vivo. Altogether, our findings indicate a regulatory role of miR-92a for WISP1 expression in pulmonary fibrosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The prediction of multi-target compound activities also represents an attractive task for machine learning with potential for drug discovery applications. Herein, we have explored activity prediction in high-dimensional target space. Different types of models were derived to predict multi-target activities. The models included naive Bayesian (NB) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers based upon compound structure information and NB models derived on the basis of activity profiles, without considering compound structure. Because the latter approach can be applied to incomplete training data and principally depends on the feature independence assumption, SVM modeling was not applicable in this case. Furthermore, iterative hybrid NB models making use of both activity profiles and compound structure information were built. In high-dimensional target space, NB models utilizing activity profile data were found to yield more accurate activity predictions than structure-based NB and SVM models or hybrid models. An in-depth analysis of activity profile-based models revealed the presence of correlation effects across different targets and rationalized prediction accuracy. Taken together, the results indicate that activity profile information can be effectively used to predict the activity of test compounds against novel targets.
