WAIRS: Improving classification accuracy by weighting attributes in the AIRS classifier	2007 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-10, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	SEP 25-28, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE			LAZY LEARNING ALGORITHMS; NEAREST-NEIGHBOR	AIRS (Artificial Immune Recognition System) has shown itself to be a competitive classifier. It has also proved to be the most popular immune inspired classifier. However, rather than AIRS being a classifier in its own right as previously described, we see AIRS more as a pre-processor to a KNN classifier. It is our view that by not explicitly classing it as such development of this algorithm has been rather held back. Seeing it as a pre-processor allows inspiration to be taken from the machine learning literature where such pre-processors are not uncommon. With this in mind, this paper takes a core feature of many such pre-processors, that of attribute weighting, and applies it to AIRS. The resultant algorithm called WAIRS (Weighted AIRS) uses a weighted distance function during all affinity evaluations. WAIRS is tested on 9 benchmark datasets and is found to outperform AIRS in the majority of cases.

A statistically aligned recombination operator for finite state machines	2007 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-10, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	SEP 25-28, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE		finite state machines; crossover; recombination; alignment	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM	Learning finite state machines from samples of data has been extensively studied within machine learning and since the dawn of evolutionary computation. Conventional crossover or recombination operators used for finite state machines suffer from the competing conventions problem, caused by the combinatorial number of isomorphisms of each distinct machine. This paper introduces an efficient alignment operator to counteract this phenomenon. Results show that when in the neighbourhood of the target machine, the aligned crossover operator reaches the optimum in far few steps (on average) than either a naive crossover operator or a standard flip-style mutation operator.

Many of the solutions considered to design efficient traffic signal patterns rely on controllers that use pre-timed stages. Such systems are unable to identify dynamic changes in the local traffic flow and thus cannot adapt to new traffic conditions. An alternative, novel approach proposed by computer scientists in order to design adaptive traffic light controllers relies on the use of intelligents agents. The idea is to let autonomous entities, named agents, learn an optimal behavior by interacting directly in the system. By using machine learning algorithms based on the attribution of rewards according to the results of the actions selected by the agents, we can obtain a control policy that tries to optimize the urban traffic flow. In this paper, we will explain how we designed an intelligent agent that learns a traffic light control policy. We will also compare this policy with results from an optimal pre-timed controller.

Support vector machine technique for the short term prediction of travel time	2007 IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium	JUN 13-15, 2007	Istanbul, TURKEY	IEEE		inductive loop detectors; machine learning techniques; support vector machines; travel time prediction		A vast majority of urban transportation systems in North America are equipped with traffic surveillance systems that provide real time traffic information to traffic management centers. The information from these are processed and provided back to the travelers in real time. However, the travelers are interested to know not only the current traffic information, but also the future traffic conditions predicted based on the real time data. These predicted values inform the drivers on what they can expect when they make the trip. Travel time is one of the most popular variables which the users are interested to know. Travelers make decisions to bypass congested segments of the network, to change departure time or destination etc., based on this information. Hence it is important that the predicted values be as accurate as possible. A number of different forecasting methods have been proposed for travel time forecasting including historic method, real-time method, time series analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANN). This paper examines the use of a machine learning technique, namely support vector machines (SVM), for the short-term prediction of travel time. While other machine learning techniques, such as ANN, have been extensively studied, the reported applications of SVM in the field of transportation engineering are very few. A comparison of the performance of SVM with ANN, real time, and historic approach is carried out. Data from the TransGuide Traffic Management center in San Antonio, Texas, USA is used for the analysis. From the results it was found that SVM is a viable alternative for short-term prediction problems when the amount of data is less or noisy in nature.

When a protein does not have similarity (homology) to any known fold, threading or fold recognition methods are used to predict structure. Fold recognition methods frequently employ secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and evolutionary information to enhance the accuracy and the quality of the predictions. In this paper, we present a residue based alignment method as an alternative to the state-of-the-art SSEA method, originally introduced by Przytycka et al. [1], and further modified by McGuffin et al. [2]. We introduce a residue-based score function, which can incorporate amino acid similarity matrices such as BLOSUM into secondary structure similarity scoring and compute joint alignments. We show that the power of the SSEA method comes from the length normalization instead of the element alignment technique and similar performance can be achieved using residue-based alignments of secondary structures by optimizing gap costs. In simulations with the two benchmark datasets, our method performs slightly better than the SSEA in terms of the fold recognition accuracy. When the secondary structure similarity matrix is combined with the amino acid based BLOSUM30 matrix, the accuracy of our method improves further (4% for the McGuffin set and 10% for the Ding and Dubchak set). The availability of aligning the amino acid and secondary structure sequences in a joint manner offers a better starting point for more elaborate techniques that employ profile-profile alignments and machine learning methods [3,4].

Incremental learning of stochastic grammars with graphical EM in radar electronic support	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol II, Pts 1-3	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	APR 15-20, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		radar electronic support; pattern recognition; stochastic grammars; incremental machine learning; graphical EM		Although Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) appear promising for recognition of radar emitters, and for estimation of their level of threat in Radar Electronic Support (ES) systems, well-known techniques for learning their production rule probabilities are computationally demanding, and cannot efficiently reflect changes in operational environments. Some techniques have been proposed for fast learning of SCFGs probabilities, yet, of those, only the HOLA technique can perform learning incrementally. In this paper, two incremental versions of the graphical EM (gEM) technique are proposed. The incremental gEM (igEM) and on-line incremental gEM (oigEM) allow for adapting production rule probabilities from new data, without having to retrain from the start on all accumulated training data. These new techniques are compared to HOLA using radar signal data. An experimental protocol has been defined such that the impact on performance of factors like the size of new data blocks for incremental learning, and the level of ambiguity of MFR grammars, may be observed. Results indicate that, contrary to HOLA, incremental learning of training data blocks with igEM and oigEM provides the same level of accuracy as learning from all cumulative data from scratch, even for small data blocks. As expected, incremental learning significantly reduces the overall time and memory complexities.

In this work, we present a new kernel that is highly robust against outliers and random noises. By incorporating a robust p-function into the distance metric, the derived robust kernel was shown to be very insensitive to the influence of outlier elements. In the experiments, we show that the proposed kernel brought significant improvement to the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier in face recognition accuracy and outperformed several traditional kernels for corrupted data. We also applied our kernel to the kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and evaluate the efficiency in recovering contaminated face images. Experiments show our robust kernel also brings benefits in noise-reduction applications.

Being too simple to cope with the nonlinearity of the speech signal, the AR process is generally embedded into a more elaborate model, such as the switching autoregressive HMM (SAR-HMM). A fundamental issue faced by models based on AR processes is that they are very sensitive to variations in the amplitude of the signal. One way to overcome this limitation is to use Gain Adaptation to adjust the amplitude by maximising the likelihood of the observed signal. However, adjusting model parameters by maximising test likelihoods is fundamentally outside the framework of standard statistical approaches to machine learning, since this may lead to overfitting when the models are sufficiently flexible. We propose a statistically principled alternative based on an exact Bayesian procedure in which priors are explicitly defined on the parameters of the AR process. Explicitly, we present the Bayesian SAR-HMM and compare the performance of this model against the standard Gain-Adapted SAR-HMM on a single digit recognition task, showing the effectiveness of the approach and suggesting thereby a principled and straightforward solution to the issue of Gain Adaptation.

Recent work in machine learning has successfully developed admixture models for text, and work in population genetics has developed such models to analyze complex groups of individuals having mixed ancestry. We introduce a family of graphical admixture models for decomposing a signal into multiple components based on a wavelet representation of the signal. Two models are developed, one using a fixed segmentation of the signal, another using recursive dyadic partitioning. Variational algorithms are derived for inferring mixture proportions and estimating parameters.

Vaguely defined, principal curves are smooth curves that pass through the middle of the data distribution. This intuitive definition is ill posed and to this day researchers have struggled with its practical implications. Two main causes of these difficulties are: (i) the desire to build a self-consistent definition using global statistics (for instance conditional expectations), and (ii) not decoupling the definition of the principal curve from the data samples. In this paper, we introduce the concept of principal sets, which are the union of all principal surfaces with a particular dimensionality. The proposed definition of principal surfaces provides rigorous conditions for a point to satisfy that can be evaluated using only the gradient and Hessian of the probability density at the point of interest. Since the definition is decoupled from the data samples, any density estimator could be employed to obtain a probability distribution expression and identify the principal surfaces of the data under this particular model.

This new filter, called support vector machine filter (SVMF), is based on the general concept of binary filters and machine learning theory. Two applications that show the potential of these filters are designed. As a first application, e proposed filter is used as an impulsive noise image denoising. T e second application presents a new edge detection structure using a different point of view from the traditional ones. The results obtained for the applications at hand show that the proposed filter outperformes Center Weighted Median in the image denoising task and the traditional edge detectors. The proposed filter can be successfully applied for the processing of images corrupted with impulsive noise while maintaining the visual quality and a low reconstruction error.

Similar to support vector machine (SVM) methodology, MSM training is formulated as a multicriteria optimization problem which aims at maximizing the separation margin and minimizing the empirical error rate on training data simultaneously. By making certain relaxation assumptions, MSM training can be reformulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem that can be solved efficiently by some standard optimization algorithms designed for SDP. Evaluation experiments are conducted on the task of the recognition of most confusable Kanji character pairs identified from popular Nakayosi and Kuchibue handwritten Japanese character databases. It is observed that the MSM-trained MP-based classifier achieves a similar character recognition accuracy as that of the state-of-the-art SVM-based classifier, yet requires much fewer classifier parameters.

To automatically execute this process by machine, we present the unsupervised high-dimensional data clustering and automatic labeling algorithms, called Locally Embedded Clustering (LEC): (i) Constructing the neighborhood weighted graph with an appropriate distance metric; (ii) Tuning the regularization parameter to smooth the approximated manifold; (iii) Calculating the unified projection in a closed-form solution for the embedding and dimensionality reduction; (iv) Choosing the top or bottom coordinates of the embedded low-dimensional space for data representation; (v) Normalizing the low-dimensional representation to have unit length; (vi) Clustering and labeling the data via K-means. Experimental results demonstrate that LEC provides better data representation, more efficient dimensionality reduction and better clustering performance than many existing methods.

Indeed, the great variability of factors to take into account makes the design of a spoken dialogue system a tailoring task and reusability of previous work is very difficult. Yet, techniques such as reinforcement learning are very demanding in training data while obtaining a substantial amount of data in the particular case of spoken dialogues is time-consuming and therefore expansive. In order to expand existing data sets, dialogue simulation techniques are becoming a standard solution. In this paper, we present a user model for realistic spoken dialogue simulation and a method for using this model so as to simulate the grounding process. This allows including grounding subdialogues as actions in the reinforcement learning process and learning adapted strategy.

Additional metrics, however, are available for such tasks, in which a word stream is partitioned into subunits. This paper compares alternative evaluation metrics-including the NIST error rate, classification error rate per word boundary, precision and recall, ROC curves, DET curves, precision-recall curves, and area under the curves-and discusses advantages and disadvantages of each. Unlike many studies in machine learning, we use real data for a real task. We find benefit from using curves in addition to a single metric. Furthermore, we find that data skew has an impact on metrics, and that differences among different system outputs are more visible in precision-recall curves. Results are expected to help us better understand evaluation metrics that should be generalizable to similar language processing tasks.

Diagnosis of tumor is backed by histopathologic examination of excised tissue in which lesion is speckled. Computer vision systems have yet to contribute significantly to the investigation of tumor areas in terms of histological slide analysis. Recently the improvements in imaging techniques led to the discovery of virtual histological slides. Virtual slides are of sufficiently high quality to generate immense interest within the research community. We describe a novel method to tackle automatic delineation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma problem in virtual histological slides. A density-based clustering algorithm improved in this study plays a key role in the determination of the proliferative cell nuclei. The experimental results on high-resolution head and neck slides show that the proposed algorithm performed well, obtaining an average of 96% accuracy.

In many practical situations, we need to deal with documents overlapping with multiple topics. Automatic assignment of multiple ICD-9-CM codes to clinical free text in medical records is a typical multi-topic text classification problem. In this paper we facilitate two different views on multi-topics. The Closed Topic Assumption (CTA) regards an absence of topics for a document as an explicit declaration that this document does not belong to those absent topics. In contrast, the Open Topic Assumption (OTA) considers the missing topics as neutral topics. This paper compares performances of various interpretations of a multi-topic Text Classification problem into a Machine Learning problem. Experimental results show that the characteristics of multi-topic assignments in the Medical NLP Challenge data is OTA-oriented.

It is a common understanding that analyzing the large amount of genomic data by pure biological methods is impractical if not impossible. Therefore many approaches have been proposed which apply some machine learning technique to analyze a particular aspect of the data. We believe, however, that taking one single measure on the genomic data of intrinsically complicated nature will not yield a very comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we support this argument by showing how a particular biological measure is good for TIS prediction in certain sequences, but not others. We propose a novel approach which uses multiple agents, each of which investigates some distinct biological perspective. Since it is not always necessary to involve all the agents to analyze any given data set, we introduce a heuristic component to predict the most appropriate agent combination scheme for the data given. Experimental results on two benchmark data collections demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Detecting possible phosphorylation sites and their corresponding protein kinases is crucial for studying the function of proteins. This task has been formulated as a machine learning problem of discriminating phosphorylation sites from non-phosphorylation sites with features of amino acid sequences. However, as phosphorylation is a dynamic event, it is hard to collect a set of protein sequences which can be safely regarded as non-phosphorylatable. Here we present a new prediction system, called OCSPP, to predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites according to peptide sequences using one-class support vector machines. This method only needs positive training samples. Experiments on the published datasets show that both the specificity and sensitivity of the method can reach higher than 90% at kinase-family level for some kinase families. Comparison results show the superiority of OCSPP over Scansite, both of which only use positive samples in prediction. OCSPP is available at http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/OCSPP/.

The in silico prediction of the disulfide connectivity has been widely studied: most results were based on few amino-acids around bonded cysteines, which we call local environments of cysteines. In order to evaluate the impact of such local information onto residue pairing, we propose a machine learning based protocol, independent from the type of contact, to detect affinities between local environments which would contribute to residues pairing. Finally, we experiment our protocol on proteins that feature disulfide or salt bridges. The results show that local environments contribute to the formation of salt bridges. However, results on disulfide bridges are not significantly positive with the class of linear functions used by the perceptron-type algorithm we propose.

Particularly, the proposed method performed feature extraction, clustering and classification on a protein structure data set, and it was validated on metal-binding sites (Ca2+, Zn2+, Na+,K+, Mg2+, Mn2+, CU2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, Cl-) present in a non-redundant PDB (a total of 11,959 metal-binding sites in 3,609 proteins). Feature extraction provided a description of critical features for each metal-binding site, which were consistent with prior knowledge about them. Furthermore, new insights about metal-binding site microenvironments could be provided by the descriptors thus obtained. Results using k-fold cross-validation for classification showed accuracy above 90%. Complete proteins were scanned using these classifiers to locate metal-binding sites.

With the industry already shifting from multicore to many-core microprocessors, software developers must extract more thread-level parallelism from applications. Unfortunately, low power-efficiency and diminishing returns in performance remain major obstacles with many cores. Poor interaction between software and hardware, and bottlenecks in shared hardware structures often prevent scaling to many cores, even in applications where a high degree of parallelism is potentially available. In some cases, throwing additional cores at a problem may actually harm performance and increase power consumption. Better use of otherwise limitedly beneficial cores by software components such as hypervisors and operating systems can improve system-wide performance and reliability, even in cases where power consumption is not a main concern. In response to these observations, we evaluate an approach to throttle concurrency in parallel programs dynamically. We throttle concurrency to levels with higher predicted efficiency from both performance and energy standpoints, and we do so via machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks (ANNs). One advantage of using ANNs over similar techniques previously explored is that the training phase is greatly simplified, thereby reducing the burden on the end user. Using machine learning in the context of concurrency throttling is novel. We show that ANNs are effective for identifying energy-efficient concurrency levels in multithreaded scientific applications, and we do so using physical experimentation on a state-of-the-art quad-core Xeon platform.

Companies like Google, Yahoo and Amazon are completely reliant on the Internet for their business. It is very hard to defend against these attacks because of the many different ways in which hackers may strike. Distinguishing between legitimate and malicious traffic is a complex task. Setting up filtering by hand is often impossible due to the large number of hosts involved in the attack. The goal of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in developing automatic defences against DDoS attacks. As a first step, a data collection and traffic filtering framework is developed. This foundation is then used to explore the potential of artificial neural networks in the defence against DDoS attacks.

S	Al-Subaie, M; Zuikernine, M			IEEE	Al-Subaie, Mohammad; Zuikernine, Mohammad			The power of temporal pattern processing in Anomaly Intrusion Detection	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-14	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2007)	JUN 24-28, 2007	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	IEEE				A clear deficiency in most of todays Anomaly Intrusion Detection Systems (AIDS) is their inability to distinguish between a new form of legitimate normal behavior and a malicious attack based on known previous normal behaviors. This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.

Support vector machines (SVM) is a novel machine learning method based on small-sample statistical learning theory, which is powerful to deal with small sample, nonlinearity, high dimension, and local minima. Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is an updating SVM version which involve equality instead of inequality constraints of standard SVM to simplify the process of SVM. Wavelet function with different resolution is used as kernel function in order to construct MS-LS-SVM. The condition of support vector kernel function is proved. This kind of kernel function can simulate almost any function in quadratic integral space, so it enhances the generalization ability of the SVM. According to the multi-scale wavelet kernel function and regularization theory, MS-LS-SVM regression model is proposed. The regression model formulates a new identification method of non-linear systems. Experiments show the proposed method not only has better identification precision, but also improves robustness and generalization than neural networks.

The theory of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is a least squares version of standard SVM which involves equality instead of inequality constraints and works with a least squares object function. A systematic approach based on LS-SVM and wavelet decomposition for fault diagnosis of hydroturbine generating units (HGU) is proposed in this paper. The vibration signals under abnormal conditions are collected and preprocessed with the wavelet decomposition and feature information of signals is extracted as the feature vectors for training and testing the LS-SVM. To classify multiple fault modes of HGU, a multiclass classifier based on LS-SVM with minimum output codes (MOC) is constructed and used in the fault diagnosis for HGU. It's showed in the simulation result that the fault types can be identified and diagnosed by the above method. Compared with the result of a RBF neural network, more excellent identification accuracy indicates the feasibility and effectiveness of LS-SVM in the fault diagnosis of HGU.

Each symbol represents a chemically distinct nucleotide molecule. Combinations of two nucleotides are called dinucleotides and CpG islands represent regions of a DNA sequence, certain substrings, which are enriched in CpG dinucleotides (C followed by G). CpG islands represent a prominent and enigmatic feature of vertebrate genomes. They are associated with the promoters of more than 60% of all human genes and represent a critical target for transcriptional control. Methylation of these CpG islands leads to structural changes: in the DNA that stops the expression of any associated gene (gene-silencing). The factors that provoke or impede methylation are currently all but unknown. In general, the maintenance of a particular pattern of methylated CpG dinucleotides represents a critical regulatory system during a host of normal developmental processes, but the erroneous methylation of CpG islands and the resulting gene-silencing can lead to the development of cancer. In this work, We present a novel unsupervised machine learning method that is capable of distinguishing biologically significant classes of CpG islands, including the separation of methylated and unmethylated CpG islands. This method represents an important novel approach that will aid in the computational prediction of methylation, which is commonly used in the pre-selection of worthwhile sequences for methylation experiments.

Therefore, it is well-known that the model thus found may not exactly describe the target concept, due to the existence of learning bias. In order to overcome the problem of too much illusionary precise models, this paper provides a general framework for imprecise regression from non-fuzzy input and output data. The goal of imprecise regression is to find a model that has the better trade-off between faithfulness w.r.t. data and (meaningful) precision. We propose an algorithm based on simulated annealing for linear and non-linear imprecise regression with triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy sets. This approach is compared with the different fuzzy regression frameworks, especially with possibilistic regression. Experiments on an environmental database show promising results.

While hand geometry systems are not new, typical measurements of lengths and widths of fingers and palms require rigid placement of the hand against pegs. Slight deviations in hand position, finger stretch or pressure can yield different measurements. This paper offers novel approaches to computing hand geometry measurements from frontal views of freely posed hands. These approaches offer advantages in hygiene, comfort and reliability. Our algorithms segment the hand from a known background under spot lights and locate feature points along the fingers and wrists. Given a database of 54 hand images, with three different images of the same hand of each subject, our approach uniquely identified a previously unseen hand with an overall accuracy of 92%.

The method first analyses the scan paths of expert radiologists during normal examination. The underlying features are then used to highlight salient regions that may be of diagnostic relevance by merging visual features learned from different experts with a weighted probability function. The framework has been evaluated using data from CT lung nodule examination and the results demonstrate the potential clinical value of the proposed technique, which can also be generalized to other diagnostic applications.

We use machine learning tools to exploit the correlation and derive decision trees to classify the incoming H.263 MC residual into one of the several coding modes in H.264. The proposed approach reduces the H.264 MB mode computation process into a decision tree lookup with very low complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces the inter-prediction complexity by as much as 60% while maintaining the coding efficiency.

Though there exist a lot of approaches to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of the models of SVM, few of them address how to eliminate the redundant data from the input training vectors. As it is known, most of support vectors distributes in the boundary of the class, which means the vectors in the center of the class are useless. In the paper, we propose a new approach based on Gaussian model to preserve the training vectors in the boundary of the class and eliminate the training vectors in the center of the class. The experiments show that our approach can reduce most of the input training vectors and preserve the support vectors at the same time, which leads to a significant reduction in the computational cost and maintains the accuracy.

Then, we present a novel framework to refine the image restoration iteratively based on recursively adjusting the motion blur parameters for image restoration to achieve the best image quality measure. Note that a no-reference image quality assessment model is learned by training a RBF neural network from a collection of representative training images simulated with different motion blurs. Experimental results blured on real videos are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed blind motion deblurring algorithm.

However, for the application of video semantic annotation, these methods only consider the relations among samples in the feature space and neglect an intrinsic property of video data: the temporally adjacent video segments (e.g., shots) usually have similar semantic concept. In this paper, we adapt this temporal consistency property of video data into graph based semi-supervised learning and propose a novel method named Temporally Consistent Gaussian Random Field (TCGRF) to improve the annotation results. Experiments conducted on the TRECVID data set have demonstrated its effectiveness.

Microcalcification classification assisted by content-based image retrieval for breast cancer diagnosis	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-7	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing ICIP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2007)	SEP 16-19, 2007	San Antonio, TX	IEEE		microcalcification classification; adaptive support vector machine; image retrieval		In this paper we propose a microcalcification classification scheme, assisted by content-based mammogram retrieval, for breast cancer diagnosis. We recently developed a machine learning approach for mammogram retrieval where the similarity measure between two lesion mammograms is modeled after expert observers. In this work we investigate how to use retrieved similar cases as references to improve the performance of a numerical classifier. Our rationale is that by adaptively incorporating local proximity information into a classifier, it can help improve its classification accuracy, thereby leading to an improved "second opinion" to radiologists. Our experimental results on a mammogram database demonstrate that the proposed retrieval-driven approach with an adaptive support vector machine (SVM) could improve the classification performance from 0.78 to 0.82 in terms of the area under the ROC curve.

To mitigate this problem, prior knowledge should be exploited. In this paper, the Gaussian process spatio-temporal variable model (GPSTVM), a novel dynamical system modeling method is proposed for learning human pose and motion priors. The GPSTVM provides a low dimensional embedding of human motion data, with a smooth density function that provides higher probability to the poses and motions close to the training data. The low dimensional latent space is optimized directly to retain the spatio-temporal structure of the high dimensional pose space. After the prior on human pose is teamed, the particle filtering can be used tracking articulated human pose; particle filtering propagates over time in the embedding space, avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach tracks 3D people accurately.

Assuming the availability of clean training data, we formulate a learning problem for determining the decision function. As an example application we use Weighted Kernel Ridge Regression to solve this learning problem for a pair of wavelet-based image denoising algorithms, yielding a "hybrid" denoising algorithm whose performance surpasses that of either initial method.

Many approaches have been proposed to estimate the cost with current project by referring to the data collected form past projects. Analogy Based Estimation (ABE), which is essentially a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach, is one of such techniques. In order to achieve successful results from ABE, many previous studies proposed effective methods to optimize the weights of the features (Feature Weighting). However, ABE is still criticized for the low prediction accuracy, and the sensitivity to the outliers. To alleviate these drawbacks, we introduce the selection of appropriate project subsets (Project Selection) by Genetic Algorithm. The promising results of the proposed method and the comparisons against other ABE model and machine learning techniques indicate our method's effectiveness and potential as a candidate method for Software Cost Estimation.

Risks associated with a ship navigation at sea are analyzed to solve the problem of uncertainty and a developing method is applied to be feasible to work out. Based on Bayes' point estimate and Bayesian learning to estimate the traffic accidents related to ship navigation, an analysis model is established for the quantitative risk assessment (QRA) of the vessel traffic system at sea. After the analysis on occurrence likelihood of the accidents related to ship traffic, a structure on the basis of Bayesian networks is developed to obtain the QRA of their relative risks. QRA is also put forward after analyzing the features and situations of the vessel traffic system and identifying the corresponding feature including characteristics of those hazards. The risk distributions of ship navigation are described and results are presented on QRA in relation to various features by using this method. This method, verified in the cases of QRA, turns out to be feasible by the use of machine learning.

When done prior to classification, estimates obtained in the lower dimension subspace are more reliable. We propose a novel method based on graphical multivariate feature fusion and use it to offer a visual representation of high dimensional data. The graphical processing method we propose, relies on using a multilayered structure of feature fusion which produces as output of the lower dimensional representation. We implement feature fusion by combining method of feature selection and feature extraction. Experiments on the data set of machine learning database indicate the novel method we propose provides better representation than Fisher's linear discriminant(FLD) and some other nonlinear methods of dimensionality reduction that are often used.

We first introduce the traditional theory of parallel coordinates and indicate that parallel coordinates has a potential for classification tasks due to its projective transformation interpretation. Nevertheless, some optimization is needed. The main aim of optimization is to hide the valueless information and reveal the most valuable information for classification. Three interaction operations are proposed to do this work. We demonstrate by several examples how to solve some pattern recognition problems graphically, we also point out that some start-of-the-art classification techniques such as Fisher linear discriminant analysis, decision trees and support vector machines are related to and can be visualized by this method. By cooperation and union of this method with some machine learning and human-machine interaction techniques into a system, the black boxes of some pattern recognition techniques are expected to be opened up, the original data, the process of classification and final results will be more transparency and understandable.

In this paper, we demonstrate the expected behavior for a robot. Then a RL-based decision tree approach which decides to split according to longterm evaluations, instead of a top-down greedy strategy which finds out the relationship between the input and output from the demonstration data. We use this method to teach a robot for target seeking problem. In order to promote the performance in tackling target seeking problem, we add a Q-learning along with the state space based on RL-based decision tree. The experiment result shows that Q-learning can promote the performance quickly. For demonstration, we build a mobile robot powered by an embedded board. The robot can detect the ball of the range in any direction with omni-directional vision system. With such powerful embedded computing capability and the efficient machine vision system, the robot can inherit the learned behavior from a simulator which has learned the empirical behavior and continue to learn with Q-learning to improve the performance of target seeking problem.

At present, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is the most popular machine learning methods, but they all have some defects. as well as some merits. In this paper, a new machine double-layer learning strategy is put forward. It integrates the merits of ANN/SVM and GA. ANN/ SVM is used to carry out inner layer learning in order to obtain model's inner parameters, and GA is used to implement outer layer learning so as to acquire model's outer parameters. Therefore the new learning method need carry out double layers learning, by comparison to common machine learning, the new method possesses stronger self-adaptive ability, and it can make up the shortcomings of single learning method and fully assure model's generalization ability. In the, end, the machine double-layer learning method is applied for nonlinear time series forecasting, and examples show the correctness and validity of the new method.

Support vector machines (SVMs), based on statistical learning theory, are gaining applications in the areas of machine learning and pattern recognition because of the high accuracy and good generalization capability. This study briefly introduces the SVM regression algorithms, and presents the SVM based system architecture for predicting yarn properties. Model selection which amounts to search in hyper-parameter space is performed for study of suitable parameters with grid-research method. Experimental results have been compared with those of ANN models. The investigation indicates that in the small data sets and real-life production, SVM models are capable of remaining the stability of predictive accuracy, and more suitable for noisy and dynamic spinning process.

However, one of the two basic assumptions, structure assumption, which is an essential point of graph-based SSL, is not embedded into the pairwise similarity measure. Accordingly, we propose a novel graph-based SSL method for video annotation, named Anisotropic Manifold Ranking (AniMR), based on a structure-related similarity measure. This method takes the influence of the density difference between samples into account to improve the pairwise similarity. Furthermore, we will show that AniMR can also be deduced from partial differential equation (PDE) based anisotropic diffusion. It demonstrates that the label propagation in AniMR is anisotropic, which is intrinsically different from the isotropic label propagation process in general graph-based SSL methods. Experiments conducted on the TRECVID data set show this approach outperforms ordinary graph-based SSL methods and is effective for video semantic annotation.

Then, we authenticate the maps produced by the application of the intelligent techniques using a novel combined watermarking embedded method. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated under different traffic conditions, mobility patterns and visualization metrics, showing its high efficiency.

However, mobile applications are required to operate in pervasive computing environments of dynamic nature. Such applications predict the appropriate context in their environment in order to act efficiently. A context model, which deals with the location prediction of moving users, is proposed. Such model is used for trajectory classification through Machine Learning techniques. Hence, spatial and spatiotemporal context prediction is regarded as context classification based on supervised learning. Finally, two classification schemes are presented, evaluated and compared with other ML schemes in order to support location prediction and decision making.

First, the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm is used to build a static motion model. RLS can learn motion model parameters as soon as new data (the robot's poses from odometry readings and ground-truth poses) arrive. As a result, it can detect when the model has converged and stop training. Second, the bi-loop recursive least squares (BiRLS) algorithm is applied to learn motion model parameters when the robot operates on a dynamically changing ground surface. BiRLS can keep track of the changes in time-varying parameters better than RLS without additional data and is better suited for building a dynamic motion model. Experimental results using data from a physical robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the two sequential learning algorithms in the FastSLAM 2.0 framework.

A simulator consists of the neural networks which directly can learn actual behaviors of the latest hardware and emulates them without physical modeling. On the other hand, the controller of the hardware is trained with the simulator by the reinforcement learning method to realize the optimal control for the target task, and applied to the real hardware. Then, as long as the iteration of these processes is simultaneously performed, the system can automatically generate the optimal controller without any works even when hardware constitution is changed or switched. In this manner, the real hardware and the simulator affect each other to make the system adaptable. Furthermore, in the processes of sampling and supplying hardware data, we put a buffering component. It keeps the latest data of the hardware and supplies non-biased data to the simulator. As an example of the proposal method, we pick up the pendulum swing-up problem. In the experiments, firstly, the optimization process performs step by step for the initial hardware constitution and the basic idea of the method is evaluated. Afterward, by changing a pendulum, we confirm system can autonomously generate the new optimal controller for the real hardware without any human operations.

A stochastic traffic signal control scheme, based on reinforcement learning, is introduced in the traffic signal control systems due to its powerful adaptability. The RL-based adaptive controller (RAC) can produced appropriate control policy to prevent the traffic network from becoming over-congested. The traditional intersection traffic model is extended to a new mode which taking some real aspects of traffic conditions into account, such as the turning fraction and the lanes scheme. The model is tested on a typical four-legged signalized intersection, and compared to both pre-timed control and full-actuated controller (FAC). Analyses of simulation results using this approach show significant improvement over traditional control, especially for the case of over-saturated traffic demand and special events such as incidents and blockages. Using the RAC model, the total mean delay of each vehicle has been reduced by 22.7% under the heavy demands compared to the FAC control algorithm.

The PRTs can operate independently and together as a whole system. Thus, they can be considered as a system of systems. By developing a set of rules for the vehicles to follow, the various parts of a Bayesian Network (BN), its nodes, parameters, structure and utility function are determined. The variables in the network are generated from the sensor data of the PRT vehicles. Using the overall system goals, a utility function can be devised that will select the best action for an agent to take. Simulation results show that this methodology is useful for "rapid prototyping" a decision theoretic agent. The gap between the intelligent agent and rule based agent performance for the collision metrics suggests that more research is needed to develop a systematic method of creating utility functions to meet system goals.

This paradigm has been generalized in a myriad of ways including the scenario when there are multiple Teachers or a hierarchy of mechanisms which collectively achieve the learning. In this paper, we(1) consider a departure from this paradigm by allowing the Student to be a member of a Classroom of students, where, for the most part, we permit each member of the Classroom to not only learn from the Teacher(s) but also to "extract" information from any of his colleague students. This paper deals with the issues concerning the modeling, decision making process and testing of such a scenario within the LA context. The main result that we show is that a weak learner can actually benefit from this capability of utilizing the information that he gets from a superior colleague - if this information transfer is done appropriately.

The paper is to model threats to battlefield helicopters, which represents a specific threat pattern and a methodology that compiles the threat into a set of rules using machine learning algorithms. This methodology based upon the inductive threat model can be used to detect real-time threats. We report experimental results that demonstrate the distinctive and predictive patterns of threats in simulated battlefield settings, and show the potential of compilation methods for the successful detection of threat systems.

Different families of learning algorithms have been applied to the task of associating observed chemical properties and pharmacological activities to certain kinds of representations of the candidate compounds. In this work, several families of molecular descriptors are considered in order to establish the appropriateness of these families for a particularly challenging drug design task consisting of characterizing the analgesic properties of a relatively large number of compounds. As a second goal, the composite use of descriptors from different families and a first attempt to select the best attributes from these families is considered. As a conclusion, relatively good discrimination results can be obtained by combining the best descriptors of the different families considered.

Non-visual feedback can aid the continuous motion control tasks that such applications frequently entail. An architecture is introduced for enabling interaction with a system that furnishes a number of gestural affordances with assistive feedback. The approach combines machine learning techniques for understanding a user's gestures with a method for the display of salient features of the underlying inference process in real time. Methods used include a particle filter to track multiple hypotheses about a user's input as the latter is unfolding, together with models of the nonlinear dynamics intrinsic to the movements of interest. Non-visual feedback in this system is based on a presentation of error features derived from an estimate of the sampled time varying probability that the user's gesture corresponds to the various tracked state trajectories in the different dynamical systems. We describe applications to interactive systems for human gait analysis and rehabilitation, a domain of considerable current interest in the movement sciences and health care.

Although there are many conventional variable selection methods, almost all of them need to prepare and learn a large number of samples in advance because they are based on off-line learning. This property is not suitable for online learning systems. To overcome this inconvenience, we propose a quick online variable selection method inspired by human problem solving behaviors. The proposed method tries to generate several variable set candidates in a speculative manner using a filter method and evaluates them using a wrapper method. The method can also function in concept-drifting environments, where relevant variable sets are changing.

A View of Multi-Agent Intelligent Simulator	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Engineering Management Conference	JUL 29-AUG 01, 2007	Lost Pines, TX	IEEE		Wholesale Power Market; Multi-agent systems; Machine learning	POWER MARKETS	During summer (2000), wholesale electricity prices in California were approximately 500% higher than those during the same months in 1998-1999. The price hike was unexpected by many policy makers and individuals who were involved in the power industry. They have been wondering whether electricity deregulation produces benefits of competition promised to consumers. Unfortunately, no scientific research has previously examined why the electricity crisis occurred in California. Hence, this study proposes a use of multi-agent intelligent simulator to empirically examine several reasons regarding why it occurred. A proposed intelligent simulator has been developed on the basis of the knowledge-based reinforcement learning and is applied to a data set on the California electricity crisis in 2000-2001. The proposed simulator estimates accurately a dynamic fluctuation of electricity price and it provides empirical results that were not identified in the previous research by Joskow and Kahn (2002).

Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem using static machine learning structures such as neural networks or support vector machines that are unable to accommodate new information into their existing models. We utilize the fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternate machine learning system that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes available. The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread machine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection and combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with the incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable as a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the G-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83%.

Number of decision tree algorithms has been developed in the past. The SLIQ algorithm [ 2] was developed with an aim to reduce diversity of the decision tree at each split. However the number of split points which needs to be examined while building the decision tree becomes enormous as the SLIQ algorithm evaluates Gini Index at every successive midpoint of attribute values. The paper proposes a novel approach to tackle this problem by reducing the number of split points to a large extent in order to improve the performance of SLIQ algorithm. The improved performance is shown on large number of benchmark datasets taken from UCI machine learning repository.	[Chandra, B.; Varghese, P.

With a double application of GTM algorithm, a specially designed approach can quantize input data to store temporal evolvement information for trend prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the improved forecast accuracy in long-term trend learning.

Because of high dimensionality of the input domain that is in the order of several hundreds or more, it is rather difficult to cover the entire domain, especially its "far corners" associated with rare events, even when we use model simulated data for the NN training. In this situation the emulating NN may be forced to extrapolate, which is beyond its generalization ability and may lead to larger errors in NN outputs. A new technique, a compound parameterization, has been developed to address this problem and to make the NN emulation approach more suitable for long-term climate and climate change predictions and other applications.

Secondly the proposed VQSVM is applied to a nonstandard learning environment, imbalanced data sets. In cases of extremely imbalanced dataset with high dimensions, standard machine learning techniques tend to be overwhelmed by the large classes. The hierarchical VQSVM contains a set of local models i.e. codevectors produced by the Vector Quantization and a global model, i.e. Support Vector Machine, to rebalance datasets without significant information loss. Some issues, e.g. distortion and support vectors, have been discussed to address the trade-off between the information loss and undersampling rate. Experiments compare VQSVM with random resampling techniques on some imbalanced datasets with varied imbalance ratios, and results show that the performance of VQSVM is superior or equivalent to random resampling techniques, especially in case of extremely imbalanced large datasets.

In reality, however, learning is not performed in isolation, starting from scratch with every new task. Instead, it is a lifelong activity during which a learner encounters many learning tasks., and usefully transfers to new tasks knowledge acquired from earlier related tasks. We propose a novel approach to transfer learning with decision trees. Our system learns a new task semi-incrementally from a partial decision tree model which captures knowledge from a previous task. Empirical results on several UCI data sets show that our approach is generally more effective and accurate than the base approach.

Therefore, assessing the real added value of prior/domain knowledge is a both deep and practical question. Most commercial data mining programs accept data pre-formatted as a table, each example being encoded as a fixed set of features. Is it worth spending time engineering elaborate features incorporating domain knowledge and/or designing ad hoc algorithms? Or else, can off-the-shelf programs working on simple features encoding the raw data without much domain knowledge do as well or better than skilled data analysts? To answer these questions, we organized a challenge for IJCNN 2007. The participants were allowed to compete in two tracks: The "prior knowledge" (PK) track, for which they had access to the original raw data representation and as much knowledge as possible about the data, and the "agnostic learning" (AL) track for which they were forced to use data pre-formatted as a table with dummy features.

The Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm is one of the most popular SVM training approaches. SMO is fast, as well as easy to implement; however, it has a limited working set size (2 points only). Faster training times can result if the working set size can be increased without significantly increasing the computational complexity. In this paper, we extend the 2-point SMO formulation to a 4-point formulation and address the theoretical issues associated with such an extension. We show that modifying the SMO algorithm to increase the working set size is beneficial in terms of the number of iterations required for convergence, and shows promise for reducing the overall training time.

The STSA utilizes the orthogonal array (OA) to uniformly generate the initial population in order to globally explore the solution space, then it applies a novel trajectory search method that can exploit the promising area thoroughly. The performance of the proposed STSA is evaluated by applying it to train a class of feedforward neural networks to solve the n-bit parity problem and the classification problem on two medical datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. By comparing with the previous studies, the experimental results revealed that the neural networks trained by the STSA have very good classification ability.

Various animal models have been used to study the disease. The majority of the models are based on induction of focal ischemic cerebral necrosis, followed by exhaustive morphometric analysis of the tissues. Despite recent advances in machine learning and image processing, neurological damage evaluations are still based on tedious manual or semi-automatic segmentation of brain images. We demonstrate a method that uses active contours combined with a kernel annealing approach to automatically segment the brain organs of interest, as well as a simple feature that highlights the contrast between normal and infarct brain tissue for automated analysis. The automated segmentation and analysis solution will be useful for increasing the productivity of experimentation and removing investigator bias from the data analysis.

Besides re-sampling, many researchers consider task decomposition as an alternative method for re-balance. Min-max modular support vector machine combines both intelligent task decomposition methods and the min-max modular network model as classifier ensemble. It overcomes several shortcomings of re-sampling, and could also achieve fast learning and parallel learning. We compare its classification performance with resampling and cost sensitive learning on several imbalanced data sets from different application areas. The experimental results indicate that our method can handle class imbalance problem efficiently.

Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem using static machine learning structures such as neural network and support vector machine that are unable to accommodate new information as it becomes available into their existing models. This paper introduces the incremental learning approach to the problem of condition monitoring. The paper starts by giving a brief definition of incremental learning. Two incremental learning techniques are applied to the problem of condition monitoring. The first method uses the incremental learning ability of Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and explores whether ensemble approach can improve the performance of the FAM. The second technique uses Learn++ that uses an ensemble of MLP classifiers.

To help in understanding the influence of single variables or components on clusterings, we introduce a novel method for the visualisation of Component Planes for SOMs. The approach presented is based on the discretisation of the components and makes use of the well-known metro map metaphor. It depicts consistent values and their ordering across the map for discretisations of various components and their correlations in terms of directions on the map. In our approach Component Lines are drawn for each component of the data, allowing the combination of numerous Component Planes into one plot. We also propose a method to further aggregate these Component Lines, by grouping highly correlated variables, i.e. similar lines on the map. To show the applicability of our approach we provide experimental results for two popular machine learning data sets.

The idea is to perform the learning process solely on the top ranked feature spaces instead of the entire original feature space, and therefore to improve the understanding of the inherent characteristics of such dataset as well as reduce the computational cost. While most of the research efforts are focused on how to select the proper features for machine learning, we studied the following important problem in this paper: can the "unimportant features" (low rank features) also provide useful information to improve the overall learning capability? In this paper, we proposed an adaptive iterative learning mechanism based on feature selection and combination voting (AdaFSCV) to address this issue. Unlike the conventional way of discarding the unselected low rank features, we iteratively build classifiers in those feature spaces as well. Such iterative process will adaptively learn information in different feature spaces, and automatically stop when one classify can not provide better information than a random guess. Finally, a probability voting algorithm is proposed to combine all the votes from different classifiers to provide the final prediction results. Simulation results on the MNIST database of handwritten digits show this method can improve the classification accuracy and robustness with certain levels of trade-off of the computational cost.

The capabilities of an extended version of the Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) for classifying news titles from the Reuters-21578 Corpus are explored. The architecture is composed of two hidden layers where each layer has an associated context layer that takes copies of previous activation states and integrates them with current activations. This results in improved performance, stability and generalisation by the adjustment of the percentage of previous activation strengths kept "in memory" by what is defined as the hysteresis parameter. The study demonstrates that this partial feedback of activations must be carefully fine-tuned to maintain optimal performance. Correctly adjusting the hysteresis values for very long and noisy text sequences is critical as classification performance degrades catastrophically when values are not optimally set.

This paper investigates the question whether it is possible to discover the functional connectivity and to model the dynamics of such neuronal cultures. Doing so may contribute to a better understanding of neural information processing. We employ a machine learning approach, which constructs the functional connectivity map of a neuronal culture based on multiple spike trains of its spontaneous activity recorded with Multi-Electrade-Array (MEA) technology. The spike train of an electrode is modeled as a point process, where the firing probability depends on the finite spike history of all electrodes. To capture potential plasticity of the network, we employ a gradient descent method, which naturally allows for online learning. Several experiments with different cultures show that learned models can predict upcoming spike activity quite well.

It is based on a partitioning of each input variable, in intervals in the numerical case and in groups of values in the categorical case. The cross-product of the univariate partitions forms a multivariate partition of the input representation space into a set of cells. This multivariate partition, called data grid, allows to evaluate the correlation between the input variables and the output variable. The best data grid is searched owing to a Bayesian model selection approach and to combinatorial algorithms. Three classification techniques exploiting data grids differently are presented and evaluated in the Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge. These preliminary experiments demonstrate the interest of using data grid in machine learning tasks.

Machine learning based cognitive communications in white as well as the gray space	2007 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Military Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM 2007)	OCT 29-31, 2007	Orlando, FL	IEEE		cognitive communications; White space; Gray space; signal detection; feature extraction; classification; machine learning; policy sets and game theory		This paper describes new ideas and results on machine learning based cognitive communications in White as well as the Gray space. We combine the concepts of signal processing, communications, pattern classification and machine learning to make a dynamic use of the spectrum such that the emanated signals do not interfere with the existing ones. Unlike other programs such as the neXt Generation (XG) communications program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), where radio scene analysis is carried out to find the spectrum holes also known as the White space, we make use of the White as well as the Gray space for non-interfering signal transmission. Our assumption is that a learning module will facilitate adaptation in the signal classification process, so that the presence of new types of waveforms can be detected, features that best facilitate classification of the previously and newly identified signals can be determined, and waveforms can be generated by using the basis-set orthogonal to the ones present in the environment. Incremental learning and prediction allow knowledge enhancement as more snap-shots of data are processed, resulting in improved decisions. Use of noncompetitive policy set results in zero interference with the already existing signals with a modest increase in the White and Gray space utilization. On the other hand competitive policy set utilizes machine learning to predict the future behavior of the signals which results in more than 90% utilization of spectrum at an expense of some interference due to errors in prediction. Some of the contributions of this project include technology advances in signal detection, feature identification, signal classification, sub-space tracking, adaptive waveform design, machine learning and prediction.

In this paper, we aim to reduce the dimensionality of the original feature space by removing irrelevant and redundant features. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is proposed for selecting a subset of most informative features. Six data sets retrieved from UCI databases and an intrusion detection benchmark data set, DARPA KDD99, are used to train and to test C4.5 and naive bayes machine learning algorithms. We compare our proposed approach with two correlation-based feature selection algorithms, CFS and FCBF and the results indicate that our approach achieves the highest averaged accuracies. Our feature selection algorithm could effectively reduce the size of data set.

In this framework, the proposed system can be associated with additional features, such as lexical or discourse information, in later steps. To verify the real-time system performance, binary decision tasks on angry and neutral emotion are performed using concatenated speech signal simulating real-time conditions.

To solve these problems, in this paper, images' semantic categories and the tolerance degree between them are defined systematically, and the machine learning-based approach of modeling tolerance relations between the semantic classes is proposed. Furthermore, the method of the semantic tolerance relation model-based image representation and the corresponding image semantic categorization algorithm is also presented We apply the proposed approach to the representations of images regarding the nature vs. man-made domain, human vs. non-human domain, and temporal domain, and compare the categorization results of them with the results not using semantic tolerance relation model.

A continuous, randomized version of A* is presented along with an empirical analysis showing planning time convergence rates in the robotic manipulation domain. The algorithm relies on several heuristics that capture a manipulator's kinematic feasibility and the local environment A statistical framework Is used to learn one of these heuristics from a large amount of training data saving the need to manually tweak parameters every time the problem changes. Using the appropriate formulation, we show that motion primitives can be automatically extracted from the training data In order to boost planning performance. Furthermore, we propose a Randomized Statistical Path Planning (RSPP) paradigm that outlines how a planner using heuristics should take advantage of machine learning algorithms. Planning results are shown for several manipulation problems tested in simulation.								Bertram D., 2006, Proceedings. 2006 Conference on International Robotics and Automation (IEEE Cat.

The navigation task requires identifying safe, traversable paths which allow the robot to progress toward a goal while avoiding obstacles. One approach is to apply Machine Learning techniques that accomplish near to far learning by augmenting near-field Stereo to identify safe terrain and obstacles in the far field. Some mechanism for applying past learned experience to the active navigation task is crucial for effective far-field classification. We introduce a new method for long-term learning in the robot navigation task by selecting a subset of previously learned linear binary classifiers. We then combine their output to produce a final classification for a new image. Techniques for efficient selection of models, as well as the combination of their output, are addressed. We evaluate the performance of our technique on three fully labeled datasets, and show that our technique outperforms several baseline techniques that do not leverage past experience.

Second, a new approach for detecting occlusions is introduced, using a machine learning classifier for pairwise comparison of persons (classifying which one is in front of the other). Third, explicit occlusion handling is then incorporated into the tracker.

We first describe an algorithm to automatically decompose a map into submap segments using a graph partitioning technique known as spectral clustering. We then describe how to train a classifier to recognize graph submaps from laser signatures using the AdaBoost machine learning algorithm. We demonstrate that the we can perform topological mapping by incrementally segmenting the world as the robot moves through its environment, and we can close the loop when the learned classifier recognizes that the robot has returned to a previously visited location.

Thus, for many tasks, robots require fine tuning of the parameters, in the implementation of behaviors and basic control actions, as well as in strategic decisional processes. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been used to find optimal parameter sets for different behaviors. However, a drawback of learning techniques is time consumption: in practical applications, methods designed for physical robots must be effective with small amounts of data. In this paper, we present a method for concurrent learning of best strategy and optimal parameters, by extending the policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm. The results of our experimental work in a simulated environment and on a real robot show a very high convergence rate.	[Cherubini, A.; Giannone, F.; Iocchi, L.; Palamara, P.

This miniature device is small, portable, low power, and potentially fieldable as a point-of-care clinical diagnostic instrument. To date, we have shown that our instrument system is capable of measuring a higher number of chemicals from breath condensate samples than traditional analytical instruments, such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). We have also found that we can detect extremely low levels of specific chemicals of interest, such as acetone, down to the single digit parts-per-billion level. The device has also been used to characterize exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples from individuals, and we have used machine learning algorithms to differentiate between persons based on the measured chemicals in their breath alone. The detection limits and analytical power are clinically relevant for many potential biomarkers, and suggests our device may have many applications for disease diagnostics in human breath analysis.

Most of them are dedicated to some particular algorithms or applications. Unfortunately, their architectures are still too naive to provide satisfactory background for advanced meta-learning problems. In order to efficiently perform sophisticated meta-level analysis, we need a very versatile, easily expandable system (in many independent aspects), which uniformly deals with different kinds of models and models with very complex structures of models (not only committees but also much more hierarchic models). Meta-level techniques must provide mechanisms facilitating optimization of computation time and memory consumption. This article presents requirements and their motivations for an advanced data mining system, efficient not only in model construction for given data, but also in meta-learning. Some particular solutions to significant problems are presented. The newly proposed advanced meta-learning architecture has been implemented in our new data analysis system.

Feature selection for change detection in multivariate time-series	2007 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining, Vols 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining	APR 01-05, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE				In machine learning the preprocessing of the observations and the resulting features are one of the most important factors for the performance of the final system. In this paper a method to perform feature selection for change detection in multivariate time-series is presented. Feature selection aims to determine a small subset which is representative for the change detection task from a given set of features. We are dealing with time-series where the classification has to be done on time-stamp level, although the smallest independent entity is a scenario consisting of one or more time-series. Despite this difficulty we will show how feature selection based on the generalization ability of a classifier can be realized by defining a cost function on scenario level. For the classification step in the feature selection process a modified Random Forest (RF) algorithm-which we will call Scenario Based Random Forest (SBRF)-is used due to its intrinsic possibility to estimate the generalization error. The excellent performance of the proposed feature selection algorithm will be shown in a car crash detection application.

This allows some understanding of what a human player might be able to learn during game play. The approach uses object tracking and situation-action pairs with the Nearest-Neighbor rule. For the game of Pong, we were able to predict the correct behavior of the computer controlled components approximately 9 out of 10 times, even if we keep the usage of knowledge about the game (beyond observing the images) at a minimum.

Among them, the support vector machine (SVM) methods have been recently applied and showed successful performance compared with other machine learning schemes. However, despite the high performance, the SVM approaches suffer from the problem of understandabflity since it is a black-box model. To overcome this limitation, this study attempted to combine the SVM with the association rule based classifier which can present the meaningful explanation about the prediction. To perform this task, a new association rule based classifier (PCPAR) was devised based on the existing classifier, CPAR, to handle the sequential data. PCPAR creates the patterns by merging the generated rides and then classifies the sequential data based on the pattern match. The experimental result presents the following: with sequential data, the PCPAR scheme shows better performance with respect to the accuracy and the number of generated patterns than CPAR method whether applied alone or combined with SM The combined scheme of SVM_PCPAR generates more compact patterns than the combined scheme of SVM with decision tree, SVM_DT, with similar performance. These patterns are easily understandable and biologically meaningful.

The method integrates machine learning algorithms along with multiobjective optimization and modeling-to-generate-alternatives procedures into decision analysis. The implicit preferences of the decision maker are elicited through screening of several alternatives. The alternatives are selected from Pareto front and near Pareto front regions that are identified first in the procedure. The decision maker's selections are input to the machine learning algorithms to generate decision rules, which are then incorporated into the analysis to generate more alternatives satisfying the decision rules. The method is illustrated using a municipal solid waste management planning problem.

We examine the use of this system in a real-number problem domain, where there is strong interest in its application to tactical communications. We investigate different encoding methods for representing real-number knowledge and study the efficacy of each method for speaker identification. We also identify several difficulties in solving the speaker identification problems with LCS and introduce new approaches to resolve the difficulties. Experimental results show that our system successfully learns 200 voice features at accuracies of 90% to 100% and 15,000 features to more than 80% for the closed-set problem, which is considered a strong result in the speaker identification community. The open-set capability is also comparable to existing numeric-based methods.	Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA	Wolf, MB (reprint author), Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.

The key notions of the approach are the formal immune network (FIN) and the coding theory for machine learning. The training of FIN includes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and autoinununization both controlled by cytokines (messenger proteins), whereas parameters of FIN can be optimized by Kullback entropy.

Submodularity and adaptation	2007 IEEE WORKSHOP ON AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UNDERSTANDING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding	DEC 09-13, 2007	Kyoto, JAPAN	IEEE				Convexity is a property of real-valued functions that enable their efficient optimization. Convex optimization moreover is a problem onto which an amazing variety of practical problems can be cast. Having strong analogs to convexity, submodularity is a property of functions on discrete sets that allows their optimization to be done in only polynomial time. Submodularity generalizes the common notion of diminishing returns. Like convexity, a large variety of discrete optimization problems can be cast in terms of submodular optimization. The first part of this talk will survey recent work taking place in our lab on the application of submodularity to machine learning, which includes discriminative structure learning and word clustering for language models. The second part of the talk will discuss recent work on a technique that for many years has been widely successful in speech recognition, namely adaptation. We will view adaptation in a setting where the training and testing time distributions are not assumed identical (unlike typical Bayes risk theory). We will derive generalization error and sample complexity bounds for adaptation which are specified in terms of a natural divergence between the train/test distributions. These bounds, moreover, lead to practical and effective adaptation strategies for both generative models (e.g., GMMs, HMMs) and discriminative models (e.g., MLPs, SVMs).

For each sentence of the relevant documents (that are assumed to be known from the upstream stages) we employ statistical classification methods to estimate the extent of its relevance to the query, whereby two aspects of relevance are taken into account: the template (type) of the query and its slots (free-text descriptions of names, organizations, topic, events and so on, around which templates are centered). The idiosyncrasy of the presented method is in the choice of features used for classification. We extract our features from charts, compilations of elements from various annotation levels, such as word transcriptions, syntactic and semantic parses, and Information Extraction annotations. In our experiments we show that this integrated approach outperforms a purely lexical baseline by as much as 30% relative in terms of F-measure. We also investigate the algorithm's behavior under noisy conditions, by comparing its performance on ASR output and on corresponding manual transcriptions.

To achieve significant improvements in prediction accuracy, the authors have developed an automated tool to prepare very large biological datasets, to be used by the learning network. By focusing on improvements in data quality and validation, our experiments yielded a highest prediction accuracy of protein secondary structure of 90.97%. An important additional aspect of this achievement is that the predictions are based on a template-free statistical modeling mechanism. The performance of each different classifier is also evaluated and discussed. In this paper a protein set of 232 protein chains are proposed to be used in the prediction. Our goal is to make the tools discussed available as services in part of a digital ecosystem that supports knowledge sharing amongst the protein structure prediction community.

We are often forced to create some set of features that appear plausible, without any strong confidence that they will yield superior learning. Beside, we often do not have any prior knowledge of what learning method is the best to apply, and thus often try multiple methods in an attempt to rind the one that performs best. This paper describes a new method and its preliminary study for constructing features based on Cellular Automata (CA). Our approach uses self-organisation ability of cellular automata by constructing features being most efficient for making predictions. We present and compare the CA approach with standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) which both use Genetic Programming (GP) for constructing the features. We show and discuss some interesting properties of using CA approach in our preliminary experimental study by constructing features on synthetically generated dataset and benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Based on the interesting results, we conclude with directions and orientation of the future work with ideas of applicability of CA approach in the feature.

It includes such basic operations as clone, mutation, and selection, even crossover. It is widely applied to function optimization, abnormal detection, pattern recognition, computer security, machine learning, control engineering, etc. However, the evolutionary process of the current artificial immune system depends on only two factors. One is the fitness between antibody and antigen, and the other is the concentration of antibody population. As a global searching method, particle swarm optimization includes an important social learning mechanism that enables it to fast approximate the global optimum. This paper proposed a hybrid artificial immune network for optimization with swarm learning and elite-keeping. Simulation results indicated this hybrid method has lower time complexity and fast convergence, and is an effective optimization tool.

However, even increasing the size and number of hidden layers of the single network does not lead to improvements. In this paper, we propose the efficient multiple classifier combine method. We define the belief to represent the posterior probability of the pattern conditioned on all components of the classifiers. Since the probabilistic approach is the most promising tools in handling the uncertainty, proposed method can aggregate the results from the each neural network component efficiently. Experiments are performed with UCI machine learning repository to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Under this light, the Semantic Web and Web 2.0 movements can be seen as intermediate steps of a natural evolution towards a new paradigm, the 3D Internet. We provide an overview of the concept 3D Internet and discuss why it is a goal worth pursuing, what it does entail, and how one can realize it. Our goal in this paper is to discuss a research agenda and raise interest in networking, security, distributed computing, and machine learning communities. We explore first the motivation for the 3D Internet and the possibilities it brings. Subsequently, we investigate the specific system level and research challenges that need to be addressed in order to make the 3D Internet a reality.

Conditional random field for 3D point clouds with adaptive data reduction	2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBERWORLDS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Cyberworlds	OCT 24-27, 2007	Hannover, GERMANY	Welfenlab, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Univ, EuroGraphics, ACM SIGWEB, ACM SIGART		classifications; conditional random fields; LIDAR data; machine learning; scale theory		We proposed using Conditional Random Fields with adaptive data reduction for the classification of 3D point clouds acquired from a Riegl Terrestrial laser scanner. The training and inference of the acquired large outdoor urban data can be time consuming. We approach the problem by computing an adaptive support region for each data point using 3D scale theory. For training and inference of the discriminative Conditional Random Fields, smaller set of data samples that contains relevant information within the support region is selected instead of using all point cloud data. We tested the algorithm on synthetically generated data and urban point clouds data acquired from the laser scanner. The computed support region is also used in feature extraction for urban point clouds data. The results showed improvement in the training and inference rate while maintaining comparable classification accuracy.	[Lim, E.

Prediction of protein sub-cellular localization through weighted combination of classifiers	2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Engineering	APR 11-12, 2007	Lahore, PAKISTAN	IEEE			AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; LOCATION PREDICTION	Prediction of sub cellular localization of proteins is an important step in genome annotation and in search for achieving novel drug targets. Conducting experiments for extracting information about protein sub cellular localization is both time consuming and costly effort. Machine learning approaches, especially, ensemble of classifiers, providing efficient and reliable mechanism of computational prediction are thus highly desired. In this context, we propose a modification to the approach proposed in [K. C. Chou, J. Cell. Biol. 99(2006)517]. We have used a weighted polling method to fuse the output of individual Covairiant Discriminant Classifiers. The individual classifiers am trained on features based on pseudo-amino acid composition of proteins. Three methods of verifications; re-substitution, jackknife, and independent data set tests have been employed and give over all accuracies of 87.13%, 71.15% and 74.90% respectively. The predicted accuracies am higher than that of the existing schemes.

With the information of when the legs are in each phase of gait, the quality of the gait during each phase can be assessed. The goal of this paper is to investigate potential use of machine learning techniques, in particular Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) to detect discrete stages in the cyclic motion of dynamic human gait. We present intelligent shoes for capturing and analyzing dynamic human gait data. Principal Component Analysis(PCA) will be applied for feature generation and data reduction, and Support Vector Machine(SVM) will be applied for training and classifier generation. The classification performance is assessed quantitatively, by measuring the percentage of time steps in which the correct event is found and qualitatively, by observing the types of errors encountered. The experimental results verify that the proposed method is valid and useful with overall accuracy to 91%.

If this resource-the users themselves-could somehow work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the accuracy of learning systems could be improved and the users' understanding and trust of the system could improve as well. We conducted a think-aloud study to see how willing users were to provide feedback and to understand what kinds of feedback users could give. Users were shown explanations of machine learning predictions and asked to provide feedback to improve the predictions. We found that users had no difficulty providing generous amounts of feedback. The kinds of feedback ranged from suggestions for reweighting of features to proposals for new features, feature combinations, relational features, and wholesale changes to the learning algorithm. The results show that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve machine learning systems, but that learning algorithms need to be extended in several ways to be able to assimilate this feedback.

Active EM to Reduce Noise in Activity Recognition	2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces	JAN 28-31, 2007	Hawaii, HI	ACM SIGART, ACM SIGGHI		Intelligent interface; machine learning; noise; Expectation-Maximization; active learning	ALGORITHM; QUERY	Intelligent desktop environments allow the desktop user to define a set of projects or activities that characterize the user's desktop work. These environments then attempt to identify the Current activity of the user in order to provide various kinds of assistance. These systems take a hybrid approach in which they allow the user to declare their Current activity but they also employ learned classifiers to predict the current activity to cover those cases where the user forgets to declare the current activity. The classifiers must be trained on the very noisy data obtained from the user's activity declarations. Instead of asking the user to review and relabel the data manually, we employ an active EM algorithm that combines the EM algorithm and active learning,. EM can be viewed as retraining on its own predictions. To make it more robust, we only retrain on those predictions that are made with high confidence. For active learning, we make a small number of queries to the user based on the most uncertain instances. Experimental results Oil real users show this active EM algorithm can significantly improve the prediction precision. and that it performs better than either EM or active learning alone.

In our research we use a microphone and a web-camera to collect this information (user-context) from the vicinity of a subject's desktop computer. Sycophant, our context-aware calendaring application and research test-bed uses machine learning techniques to successfully predict a user-preferred alarm type. Discounting user identity and motion information significantly degrades Sycophant's performance on the alarm prediction task. Our user study emphasizes the need for user-context for personalizable user interfaces which can better meet effectiveness and utility usability goals. Results from our study further demonstrate that contextual information helps adaptive interfaces to improve user-experience.

Visited pages are easily collectible, e.g., front browsers' histories and toolbars, or desktop search tools, and they often contain documents related to the current user needs. Nevertheless, menus, advertisements or pages that cover multiple topics affect negatively the advantages of an implicit feedback technique that exploits these data to build and keep updated user profiles. This work describes a technique to collect text relevant to the current needs from sequences of pages visited by the user. The evaluation shows how it outperforms other techniques that consider the whole page contents. We also introduce an improvement based on machine learning techniques that is currently under evaluation.

In this paper we use different types of member classifiers based on heterogeneous features to increase the diversity when we implement the multiple Classifier System (MCS). Member classifiers adopted in this pap er include the k-NN classifier and the BP network classifier. The combination algorithm is based on Dempster rule of combination. The approaches to generating mass functions corresponding to the types of member classifiers are proposed. It is shown experimentally that the proposed approaches are rational and effective. The approaches proposed in this paper provide a new, way to combine the two different types of classifiers: the k-NN classifiers and the BP network classifiers. Thus their corresponding strengths con be fully utilized and their corresponding draw backs can be counteracted.

Different from the traditional linear dimensionality reduction methods, recently some nonlinear Methods have been proposed in virtue of manifold learning These methods can efficiently discover the low-dimensional nonlinear manifold in a high-dimensional data space and further preserve the manifold structure of the data points in the low-dimensional embedding space. Despite their attractive properties, these nonlinear methods are sensitive to the outliers in the data sets. Moreover, the exisiting locally nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods generally neglect the globally structural information. 117 this paper, we address these problems in the context of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). Through capturing the local and global geometry information simultaneously, we propose an alternative approach to make the local embedding relatively more robust, called as Alternative Robust Local Embedding (ARLE).

Support vector machines (SVMs), based on statistical learning theory, are gaining applications in the areas of machine learning and pattern recognition because of the high accuracy and good generalization capability. This study briefly introduces the SVM regression algorithms, and presents the SVM based system architecture for predicting yarn properties. Model selection which amounts to search in hyper-parameter space is performed for study of suitable parameters with grid-research method. Experimental results have been compared with those of ANN models. The investigation indicates that in the small data sets and real-life production, SVM models are capable of remaining the stability of predictive accuracy, and more suitable for noisy and dynamic spinning process.

It is the process of extracting patterns or predicting previously unknown and useful trends from large quantities of data by using the knowledge of multidisciplinary fields such as statistics, mode identify, artificial intelligence., machine learning, database, management information system and so on. The artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the techniques of data mining. It is the nonlinear auto-fit dynamic system made of many cells with simulating the construction of biology neural systems. ANN has the ability to mapping high nonlinear system, associable memory and abstractly generalization. It can make model from analyzing the mode in the data and discover the unknown knowledge. The present paper gives an engineering application of data mining based on neural networks. The back propagation (BP) neural network is used as the algorithm of data mining. Then the effects of structural technologic parameters on stress in the weld region of the shield engine rotor in a submarine are analyzed. The mined data come from the numerical simulations of the finite element method. The effects of different parameters on the stress in the weld region are achieved from the results of the data mining.

Because of the large amount of computation required by SVR, however, most studies have used a batch mode. Although a recently developed online form of SVR shows faster learning performance than batch SNIP, the amount of computation required by online SVR prevent its use in real-time robot learning control, which requires short sampling time. Here, we present a novel method, Local online SVR for Learning control, or LoSVR, that extends online SVR with a windowing method. We demonstrate the performance of LoSVR in learning the inverse dynamics of both a simulated two-joint robot and a real one-link robot arm. Our results show that, in both cases, LoSVR can learn the inverse dynamics on-line faster and with a better accuracy than batch SVR.

But sometimes the data set for clustering contains vectors missing one or more of the feature values, and is called as incomplete. The incomplete data problem exists in a wide range of field such as computer vision, biological system, and remote sensing. The problem of clustering of incomplete data is considered in this paper. In this paper, we propose a new extended MFA (Mean Field Annealing) algorithm to solve the problem of clustering of incomplete data in the continuous-value state space and show the result of the experiment. The traditional fuzzy clustering methods calculate the centroid vectors of the clusters and then determined the membership probability, and repeat this process until the optimum solution is found. By contrast, the method proposed in this paper perturbs the membership probability, and determines whether to accept the perturbed state or not according to the changes of the energy. The result is compared with the Optimal Completion Strategy fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering of incomplete data algorithm and shows that the proposed method solves the problem of clustering incomplete data very well and gets a much better result.

An extensive relevant literature displays that they have become hot topics in the field of machine learning. Due to the difference of their mechanism, little research is done to compare their performance. This paper experimentally compared several features of RVM with SVM which can characterize the classification performance on the basis of deeply understanding their algorithms. The results show that RVM is almost equal to SVM on training efficiency and classification accuracy, but as to sparse property, generalization ability and decision speed, RVM performs better. So it is recommended to study RVM deeply and extend its application areas further.

Successful approaches to high-level feature detection typically leverage the techniques learned from Machine Learning utilized through ensemble architectures to achieve strong performance. However these approaches whilst successful are computationally expensive, and depending on the task require the use of significant computational resources. We propose two fusion methods that aim to combine the output of an initial basic machine learning approach with a lower-quality information source in order to gain diversity in the classified results whilst only requiring modest computing resources.

However, the lack of a common lingua franca makes it impossible to use vendor-specific network management data to ascertain the state of the network at any given time. Furthermore, the tools used to analyze management data, which include information and data models, ontologies, machine learning algorithms, and policy languages, are all different, and hence require different data in different formats. This paper describes a new version of the DENng policy model, which is part of the FOCALE autonomic network architecture. This new policy model has been built using three guiding principles: (1) the policy model is rooted in information models, so that it can govern managed entities, (2) the model is expressly constructed to facilitate the generation of ontologies, so that reasoning about policies constructed from the model may be done, and (3) the model is expressly constructed so that a policy language can be developed from it.

A classifier induced from an imbalanced data set has, typically, a low error rate for the majority class and an unacceptable error rate for the minority class. This paper firstly provides a systematic study on the various methodologies that have tried to handle this problem. Finally, it presents an experimental study of these methodologies with a proposed local cost sensitive technique and it concludes that such a framework can be a more effective solution to the problem. Our method seems to allow improved identification of difficult small classes in predictive analysis, while keeping the classification ability of the other classes in an acceptable level.

The aim of this work is to determine which approach to the robotic mapping problem imbues a mobile robot with the greatest ability to create an accurate representation of its operating environment. We accomplish this by analysing the performance of several established mapping techniques using identical test data. Through evaluating the maps generated by these paradigms using an extensible benchmarking suite that our group has developed we outline which paradigm yields the greatest representational ability.

Rocchio is the classic method for text classification in information retrival. Based on these three approaches and using classifier fusion methods, we propose a novel approach in text classification. Our approach is a supervised method, meaning that the list of categories should be defined and a set of training data should be provided for training the system. In this approach, documents are represented as vectors where each component is associated with a particular word. We propose voting methods and OWA operator and Decision Template method for combining classifiers. Experimental results show that these methods decrese the classification error 15 percent as measured on 2000 training datafrom 20 newsgroups dataset.

An example of such a system is a mobile phone fleet. It uses machine-learning and probabilistic approaches. Achieving Advanced Device self-Managing (ADsM) capabilities in a highly reconfigurable mobile phone system can be considered as an inevitable next step in the evolution of today's management tools like the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Device Management (DM) [2]. The OMA DM framework is so far predominantly targeted towards the update of already sold mobiles by the device manufacturer and the provisioning of mobile network operator dependent settings. However, in future this centralized DM server architecture shall be replaced by a more device centric distributed structure. The "Advanced Device self Management" as proposed here provides a value-addition and a clear competitive advantage by applying Autonomics [4] and thus enabling Self-Management of mobile terminals.

We develop the ESTk, which is an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system based on Finite State Network (FSN) for processing Korean spoken questions. For answer extraction, we utilize machine learning techniques and pattern extraction method. With our live-update interaction method, our robot can be extended with new knowledge in real-time.

In order to design agents that learn efficiently and effectively from their instruction, it is important to understand how people, that are not experts in Machine Learning or robotics, will try to teach social robots. In prior work we have shown that human trainers use positive and negative feedback differentially when interacting with a Reinforcement Learning agent. In this paper we present experiments and implementations on two platforms, a robotic and a computer game platform, that explore the asymmetric communicative intents of positive and negative feedback from a human partner, in particular that negative feedback is both about the past and about intentions for future action.

Traditional approaches such as port-based and payload-based identification are becoming increasingly difficult with many new applications (e.g. P2P) using dynamic port numbers, masquerading techniques, and encryption to avoid detection. An alternative approach is to classify traffic by exploiting the distinctive characteristics of flow statistics. We present here a traffic classification scheme based on machine learning (ML). The performance impact of the dataset size, feature selection and ML algorithm selection is demonstrated by experiments. The genetic algorithm based feature selection can dramatically reduce the ML learning and modeling time with less decrease or even a bit increase in classification accuracy. The chosen ML algorithms: TAN, C4.5, NBTree, RandomForest and distance weighted KNN, can reach high classification accuracy. Typically, C4.5 and RandomForest are superior to other ML algorithms in computational complexity. Besides, experiments show that the size of data set would impact on the classification performance, and tuning dataset's size could meet the requirements of specific applications.

Accurate and fast prediction requires algorithmic capability, in particular, machine learning algorithms. Various learning and prediction methods have been developed and applied to provide such capability. However, these methods can only provide bare predictions, i.e. algorithms predicting values for new examples without saying how reliable these predictions are. In this paper, an on-line learning algorithm based on ridge regression is described. The on-line algorithm can give reasonably tight tolerance intervals for regression estimates. The predicted results of the algorithm on two real network traffic datasets show good performance.

Based on Statistical Learning Theory (SLT), Support vector machine(SVM) is a new kind of machine learning method that is used for classification and regression, it realizes the trade-off between empirical risk minimization( ERM) and generalization capability. SVM and decision tree have combined into one multi-class classifier so as to solve multi-class classification problems. In this paper, SVM is extended to non-linear SVM by using kernel functions and a new classification based on NSVM decision tree is proposed. Experiments show that the proposed method is effective and feasible.

The effectiveness of ARTMAP-FD in classifying keystroke patterns is analyzed and compared against a number of widely used machine learning systems. The results show that ARTMAP-FD performs well against many of its counterparts in keystroke patterns classification. Apart from that, instead of using the conventional typing timing characteristics, the applicability of typing pressure to ascertaining user's identity is investigated. The experimental results show that combining both latency and pressure patterns can improve the Equal Error Rate (ERR) of the system.

In fact, multimedia understanding is a difficult and challenging task even using machine-learning techniques. To deal with this challenge, in this paper we propose an innovative method that employs data mining techniques and content-based paradigm to conceptualize videos. Mainly, our proposed method puts the focus on: (1) Construction of prediction models, namely speech-association model Model(Sass) and visual-statistical model Model(CRM), and (2) Fusion of prediction models to annotate unknown videos automatically. Without additional manual cost, discovered speech-association patterns can show the implicit relationships among the sequential images. On the other hand, visual features can atone for the inadequacy of speech-association patterns. Empirical evaluations reveal that our approach makes, on the average, the promising results than other methods for annotating videos.	[Tseng, Vincent.

However, the connotation of labeling in ranking is quite different from that in classification. Specifically, the labeling of samples for ranking is usually incomplete, i.e. only a part of samples are labeled. In order to remedy this methodological gap, in this paper we propose a hybrid learning framework, called fuzzy-label learning, which consists of two layers. First, we utilize a label-propagation algorithm to estimate those labels of unlabeled samples by their neighborhoods. Second, we adopt RankBoost on the samples with fuzzy labels. Experiments with five-fold cross-validation using the Letor benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid learning framework can definitively improve the search performance achieved by the RankBoost algorithm for web information retrieval.

The future generation of intelligent embedded devices will obviously require such classifiers working on-line and performing classification tasks in a variety of fields ranging from data mining to recognition tasks in image and video. Among different such techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been found to deliver state of the art performance thus emerging as the clear winner.

Such agents will need to be able to learn, both in order to correct and circumvent their inevitable imperfections, and to keep up with a dynamically changing world. They will also need to be able to interact with one another, whether they share common goals, they pursue independent goals, or their goals are in direct conflict. This paper presents current research directions in machine learning, multiagent reasoning, and robotics, and advocates their unification within concrete application domains. Ideally, new theoretical results in each separate area will inform practical implementations while innovations from concrete multiagent applications will drive new theoretical pursuits, and together these synergistic research approaches will lead us towards the goal of fully autonomous agents.

Detection of Cognitive States from fMRI data using Machine Learning Techniques	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					Over the past decade functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful technique to locate activity of human brain while engaged in a particular task or cognitive state. We consider the inverse problem of detecting the cognitive state of a human subject based on the fMRI data. We have explored classification techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machines. In order to reduce the very high dimensional fMRI data, we have used three feature selection strategies. Discriminating features and activity based features were used to select features for the problem of identifying the instantaneous cognitive state given a single fMRI scan and correlation based features were used when fMRI data from a single time interval was given. A case study of visuo-motor sequence learning is presented. The set of cognitive states we are interested in detecting are whether the subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is paying attention only towards the position or towards both the color and position of the visual stimuli. We have successfully used correlation based features to detect position-color related cognitive states with 80% accuracy and the cognitive states related to learning with 62.5% accuracy.

Unsupervised Discretization Using Kernel Density Estimation	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					Discretization, defined as a set of cuts over domains of attributes, represents an important preprocessing task for numeric data analysis. Some Machine Learning algorithms require a discrete feature space but in real-world applications continuous attributes must be handled. To deal with this problem many supervised discretization methods have been proposed but little has been done to synthesize unsupervised discretization methods to be used in domains where no class information is available. Furthermore, existing methods such as (equal-width or equal-frequency) binning, are not well-principled, raising therefore the need for more sophisticated methods for the unsupervised discretization of continuous features. This paper presents a novel unsupervised discretization method that uses non-parametric density estimators to automatically adapt sub-interval dimensions to the data. The proposed algorithm searches for the next two sub-intervals to produce, evaluating the best cut-point on the basis of the density induced in the sub-intervals by the current cut and the density given by a kernel density estimator for each sub-interval. It uses cross-validated log-likelihood to select the maximal number of intervals. The new proposed method is compared to equal-width and equal-frequency discretization methods through experiments on well known benchmarking data.

Many machine learning algorithms follow this principle and search for a small hypothesis within the version space. The principle has been the subject of a heated debate with theoretical and empirical arguments both for and against it. Earlier empirical studies lacked sufficient coverage to resolve the debate. In this work we provide convincing empirical evidence for Occam's razor in the context of decision tree induction. By applying a variety of sophisticated sampling techniques, our methodology samples the version space for many real-world domains and tests the correlation between the size of a tree and its accuracy. We show that indeed a smaller tree is likely to be more accurate, and that this correlation is statistically significant across most domains.

Bharat			Feature Selection and Kernel Design via Linear Programming	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					The definition of object (e. g., data point) similarity is critical to the performance of many machine learning algorithms, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. However, it is often the case that a similarity function is unknown or chosen by hand. This paper introduces a formulation that given relative similarity comparisons among triples of points of the form object i is more like object j than object k, it constructs a kernel function that preserves the given relationships. Our approach is based on learning a kernel that is a combination of functions taken from a set of base functions (these could be kernels as well). The formulation is based on defining an optimization problem that can be solved using linear programming instead of a semi-definite program usually required for kernel learning. We show how to construct a convex problem from the given set of similarity comparisons and then arrive to a linear programming formulation by employing a subset of the positive definite matrices. We extend this formulation to consider representation/evaluation efficiency based on formulating a novel form of feature selection using kernels (that is not much more expensive to solve). Using publicly available data, we experimentally demonstrate how the formulation introduced in this paper shows excellent performance in practice by comparing it with a baseline method and a related state-of-the art approach, in addition of being much more efficient computationally.

The resulting embeddings, however, may fail to capture features of interest. One solution is to learn a distance metric which prefers embeddings that capture the salient features. We propose a novel approach to learning a metric from side information to guide the embedding process. Our approach admits the use of two kinds of side information. The first kind is class-equivalence information, where some limited number of pairwise "same/different class" statements are known. The second form of side information is a limited set of distances between pairs of points in the target metric space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by producing embeddings that capture features of interest.

This paper brings contributions to its theory and algorithms. We first unify a well-known top-down decision tree induction algorithm due to [Kearns and Mansour, 1999], and discrete AdaBoost [Freund and Schapire, 1997], as two versions of a same higher-level boosting algorithm. It may be used as the basic building block to devise simple provable boosting algorithms for complex classifiers. We provide one example: the first boosting algorithm for Oblique Decision Trees, an algorithm which turns out to be simpler, faster and significantly more accurate than previous approaches.

Analogical Learning in a Turn-Based Strategy Game	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					A key problem in playing strategy games is learning how to allocate resources effectively. This can be a difficult task for machine learning when the connections between actions and goal outputs are indirect and complex. We show how a combination of structural analogy, experimentation, and qualitative modeling can be used to improve performance in optimizing food production in a strategy game. Experimentation bootstraps a case library and drives variation, while analogical reasoning supports retrieval and transfer. A qualitative model serves as a partial domain theory to support adaptation and credit assignment. Together, these techniques can enable a system to learn the effects of its actions, the ranges of quantities, and to apply training in one city to other, structurally different cities. We describe experiments demonstrating this transfer of learning.

Constructing New and Better Evaluation Measures for Machine Learning	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA				ROC CURVE; AREA	Evaluation measures play an important role in machine learning because they are used not only to compare different learning algorithms, but also often as goals to optimize in constructing learning models. Both formal and empirical work has been published in comparing evaluation measures. In this paper, we propose a general approach to construct new measures based on the existing ones, and we prove that the new measures are consistent with, and finer than, the existing ones. We also show that the new measure is more correlated to RMS (Root Mean Square error) with artificial datasets. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that the greedy-search based algorithm (such as artificial neural networks) trained with the new and finer measure usually can achieve better prediction performance. This provides a general approach to improve the predictive performance of existing learning algorithms based on greedy search.

Recently, it is also used for multi-instance (MI) learning by employing a kernel that is defined directly on the bags. As only the bags (but not the instances) have known labels, this MI kernel implicitly assumes all instances in the bag to be equally important. However, a fundamental property of MI learning is that not all instances in a positive bag necessarily belong to the positive class, and thus different instances in the same bag should have different contributions to the kernel. In this paper, we address this instance label ambiguity by using the method of marginalized kernels. It first assumes that all the instance labels are available and defines a label-dependent kernel on the instances. By integrating out the unknown instance labels, a marginalized kernel defined on the bags can then be obtained. A desirable property is that this kernel weights the instance pairs by the consistencies of their probabilistic instance labels. Experiments on both classification and regression data sets show that this marginalized MI kernel, when used in a standard SVM, performs consistently better than the original MI kernel. It also outperforms a number of traditional MI learning methods.

Some special structure BNCs have been proposed and demonstrate promise performance. However, recent researches show that structure learning in BNs may lead to a non-negligible posterior problem, i.e, there might be many structures have similar posterior scores. In this paper, we propose a generalized additive Bayesian network classifiers, which transfers the structure learning problem to a generalized additive models (GAM) learning problem. We first generate a series of very simple BNs, and put them in the framework of GAM, then adopt a gradient-based algorithm to learn the combining parameters, and thus construct a more powerful classifier. On a large suite of benchmark data sets, the proposed approach outperforms many traditional BNCs, such as naive Bayes, TAN, etc, and achieves comparable or better performance in comparison to boosted Bayesian network classifiers.

Good high-level features are those that concentrate information about the classification task. Such features can often be constructed as non-linear combinations of raw or native input features such as the pixels of an image. Using many nonlinear combinations, as do SVMs, can dilute the classification information necessitating many training examples. On the other hand, searching even a modestly-expressive space of nonlinear functions for high-information ones can be intractable. We describe an approach to feature construction where task-relevant discriminative features are automatically constructed, guided by an explanation-based interaction of training examples and prior domain knowledge.

This paper focuses on machine learning methods for predicting quaternary structural folds, which consist of multiple protein chains that form chemical bonds among side chains to reach a structurally stable domain. The complexity associated with modeling the quaternary fold poses major theoretical and computational challenges to current machine learning methods. We propose methods to address these challenges and show how (1) domain knowledge is encoded and utilized to characterize structural properties using segmentation conditional graphical models; and (2) model complexity is handled through efficient inference algorithms. Our model follows a discriminative approach so that any informative features, such as those representative of overlapping or long-range interactions, can be used conveniently. The model is applied to predict two important quaternary folds, the triple beta-spirals and double-barrel trimers. Cross-family validation shows that our method outperforms other state-of-the art algorithms.

B	Michael, L		Veloso, MM		Michael, Loizos			Learning from Partial Observations	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					We present a general machine learning framework for modelling the phenomenon of missing information in data. We propose a masking process model to capture the stochastic nature of information loss. Learning in this context is employed as a means to recover as much of the missing information as is recoverable. We extend the Probably Approximately Correct semantics to the case of learning from partial observations with arbitrarily hidden attributes. We establish that simply requiring learned hypotheses to be consistent with observed values suffices to guarantee that hidden values are recoverable to a certain accuracy; we also show that, in some sense, this is an optimal strategy for achieving accurate recovery. We then establish that a number of natural concept classes, including all the classes of monotone formulas that are PAC learnable by monotone formulas, and the classes of conjunctions, disjunctions, k-CNF, k-DNF, and linear thresholds, are consistently learnable from partial observations. We finally show that the concept classes of parities and monotone term 1-decision lists are not properly consistently learnable from partial observations, if RP not equal NP. This implies a separation of what is consistently learnable from partial observations versus what is learnable in the complete or noisy setting.

A Tighter Error Bound for Decision Tree Learning Using PAC Learnability	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					Error bounds for decision trees are generally based on depth or breadth of the tree. In this paper, we propose a bound for error rate that depends both on the depth and the breadth of a specific decision tree constructed from the training samples. This bound is derived from sample complexity estimate based on PAC learnability. The proposed bound is compared with other traditional error bounds on several machine learning benchmark data sets as well as on an image data set used in Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed bound gives tighter estimation of the empirical error.	[Pichuka, Chaithanya; Bapi, Raju S.; Bhagvati, Chakravarthy; Pujari, Arun K.; Deekshatulu, B.

For example, high-end servers that can be partitioned into logical subsystems and repartitioned on the fly are now becoming available. This development raises the possibility of reconfiguring distributed systems online to optimize for dynamically changing workloads. However, it also introduces the need to decide when and how to reconfigure. This paper presents one approach to solving this online reconfiguration problem. In particular, we learn to identify, from only low-level system statistics, which of a set of possible configurations will lead to better performance under the current unknown workload. This approach requires no instrumentation of the system's middleware or operating systems. We introduce an agent that is able to learn this model and use it to switch configurations online as the workload varies. Our agent is fully implemented and tested on a publicly available multi-machine, multi-process distributed system (the online transaction processing benchmark TPC-W). We demonstrate that our adaptive configuration is able to outperform any single fixed configuration in the set over a variety of workloads, including gradual changes and abrupt workload spikes.			jwildstr@cs.utexas.edu; pstone@cs.utexas.edu; witchel@cs.utexas.edu; dahlin@cs.utexas.edu					CAIN H.

B	Zhang, Y; Jin, XM		Veloso, MM		Zhang, Yi; Jin, Xiaoming			Concept Sampling: Towards Systematic Selection in Large-Scale Mixed Concepts in Machine Learning	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA					This paper addresses the problem of concept sampling. In many real-world applications, a large collection of mixed concepts is available for decision making. However, the collection is often so large that it is difficult if not unrealistic to utilize those concepts directly, due to the domain-specific limitations of available space or time. This naturally yields the need for concept reduction. In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of concept sampling: to find the optimal subset of a large collection of mixed concepts in advance so that the performance of future decision making can be best preserved by selectively combining the concepts remained in the subset. The problem is formulized as an optimization process based on our derivation of a target function, which ties a clear connection between the composition of the concept subset and the expected error of future decision making upon the subset. Then, based on this target function, a sampling algorithm is developed and its effectiveness is discussed. Extensive empirical studies suggest that, the proposed concept sampling method well preserves the performance of decision making while dramatically reduces the number of concepts maintained and thus justify its usefulness in handling large-scale mixed concepts.

We address click prediction in the Web search scenario by introducing a method for click prediction based on observations of past queries and the clicked documents. Due to the sparsity of the problem space, commonly encountered when learning for Web search, new approaches to learn the probabilistic relationship between documents and queries are proposed. Two probabilistic models are developed, which differ in the interpretation of the query-document co-occurrences. A novel technique, namely, conditional probability hierarchy, flexibly adjusts the level of granularity in parsing queries, and, as a result, leverages the advantages of both models.

This is important for applications (e.g., games, simulators, interactive displays) where an agent must behave in a manner that appears human-like. We present a novel technique for learning reactive policies that mimic demonstrated human behavior. The user demonstrates the desired behavior by dictating the agent's actions during an interactive animation. Later, when the agent is to behave autonomously, the recorded data is generalized to form a continuous state-to-action mapping. Combined with an appropriate animation algorithm (e.g., motion capture), the learned policies realize stylized and natural-looking agent behavior. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our technique for quickly producing policies which result in lifelike virtual agent behavior.			jondinerstein@yahoo.com; egbert@cs.byu.edu; ventura@cs.byu.edu					ANGROS R, 2002, P AAMAS 02; Badler N.J., 1999, COMMUN ACM, V42, P65; COLE R, 2003, P IEEE, V91; Dinerstein J, 2005, COMPUT INTELL, V21, P90, DOI 10.1111/j.0824-7935.2005.00266.x; Dinerstein J, 2005, ACM T GRAPHIC, V24, P262, DOI 10.1145/1061347.1061352; DINERSTEIN J, 2006, VISUAL COMPUTER, V22; Duncan J., 2002, CINEFEX, V89, P64; FRIEDRICH, 1996, MACH LEARN, V23, P163; Gratch J, 2005, AUTON AGENT MULTI-AG, V11, P23, DOI 10.1007/s10458-005-1081-1; Gratch J, 2002, IEEE INTELL SYST, V17, P54, DOI 10.1109/MIS.2002.1024753; Haykin S., 1999, NEURAL NETWORKS COMP; Isbell C.

The augmented experiment, proposed in this paper, consist of 1) various sensors to collect the real world activities of human subjects and project them into the virtual space, 2) multiagent simulations to simulate human activities in the virtual space, and 3) communication channels to inform simulation status to human subjects in the real space. To create agent and interaction models incrementally from the participatory design process, we propose the participatory design loop that uses deductive machine learning technologies. Indoor and outdoor augmented experiments have been actually conducted in the city of Kyoto. Both experiments were intended to test new disaster evacuation systems based on mobile phones.

Using Focal Point Learning to Improve Tactic Coordination in Human-Machine Interactions	20TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	JAN 06-12, 2007	Hyderabad, INDIA				COMMUNICATION	We consider an automated agent that needs to coordinate with a human partner when communication between them is not possible or is undesirable (tactic coordination games). Specifically, we examine situations where an agent and human attempt to coordinate their choices among several alternatives with equivalent utilities. We use machine learning algorithms to help the agent predict human choices in these tactic coordination domains. Learning to classify general human choices, however, is very difficult. Nevertheless, humans are often able to coordinate with one another in communication-free games, by using focal points, "prominent" solutions to coordination problems. We integrate focal points into the machine learning process, by transforming raw domain data into a new hypothesis space. This results in classifiers with an improved classification rate and shorter training time. Integration of focal points into learning algorithms also results in agents that are more robust to changes in the environment.

We propose Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a novel method that represents the meaning of texts in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia. We use machine learning techniques to explicitly represent the meaning of any text as a weighted vector of Wikipedia-based concepts. Assessing the relatedness of texts in this space amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using conventional metrics (e.g., cosine). Compared with the previous state of the art, using ESA results in substantial improvements in correlation of computed relatedness scores with human judgments: from r = 0.56 to 0.75 for individual words and from r = 0.60 to 0.72 for texts. Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain to human users.

However, the common choice for sense classes, WordNet lexicographer files, are not designed for machine learning based word sense disambiguation. In this work, we explore the use of clustering techniques in an effort to construct sense classes that are more suitable for word sense disambiguation end-task. Our results show that these classes can significantly improve classifier performance over the state of the art results of unrestricted word sense disambiguation.

Machine learning (ML) provides several techniques for automatically acquiring those heuristics. Usually, a planner solves a problem, and a ML technique generates knowledge from the search episode in terms of complete plans (macro-operators or cases), or heuristics (also named control knowledge in planning). In this paper, we present a novel way of generating planning heuristics: we learn heuristics in one planner and transfer them to another planner. This approach is based on the fact that different planners employ different search bias. We want to extract knowledge from the search performed by one planner and use the learned knowledge on another planner that uses a different search bias. The goal is to improve the efficiency of the second planner by capturing regularities of the domain that it would not capture by itself due to its bias. We employ a deductive learning method (EBL) that is able to automatically acquire control knowledge by generating bounded explanations of the problem-solving episodes in a Graphplan-based planner. Then, we transform the learned knowledge so that it can be used by a bidirectional planner.

This paper proposes a new method to infer users' long-term properties from their respective location histories. Counting the instances of sensor detection for every user, we can obtain a sensor-user matrix. After generating features from the matrix, a machine learning approach is taken to automatically classify users into different categories for each user property. Inspired by information retrieval research, the problem to infer user properties is reduced to a text categorization problem. We compare weightings of several features and also propose sensor weighting. Our algorithms are evaluated using experimental location data in an office environment.

This paper presents an adaptive sampling mechanism called EXIST for Exploration/eXploitation Inference for Software Testing, able to retrieve distinct feasible paths with high probability. EXIST proceeds by alternatively exploiting and updating a distribution on the set of program paths. An original representation of paths, accommodating long-range dependencies and data sparsity and based on extended Parikh maps, is proposed. Experimental validation on real-world and artificial problems demonstrates dramatic improvements compared to the state of the art.

Common approaches to term weighting are based either on statistical or on natural language analysis. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that capitalizes from the advantages of both the strategies by adopting a machine learning approach. In the proposed method, the weights are computed by a parametric function, called Context Function, that models the semantic influence exercised amongst the terms of the same context. The Context Function is learned from examples, allowing the use of statistical and linguistic information at the same time. The novel algorithm was successfully tested on crossword clues, which represent a case of Single-Word Question Answering.

The goal is to assign scores which are comparable to those of human scorers by coupling two AI technologies: optical handwriting recognition and automated essay scoring. The test-bed is that of essays written by children in reading comprehension tests. The process involves several image-level operations: removal of pre-printed matter, segmentation of handwritten text lines and extraction of words. Recognition constraints are provided by the reading passage, the question and the answer rubric. Scoring is based on using a vector space model and machine learning of parameters from a set of human-scored samples. System performance is comparable to that of scoring based on perfect manual transcription.

This technology is developed to use more than one agent in the system; this is called Multi Agent systems (MAS). The system that depends on this technology should have been studied extensively. One of the most important characteristic of this is its ability to learn and adapt itself, where it has been done using one of the machine learning algorithms. Repertory Grid (RG) which has become a widely used and accepted technique for knowledge elicitation and has been implemented as a major component for many computer-based knowledge acquisition systems. In this paper, RG has been developed to be one of the machine learning algorithms and then used in MAS.

Location learning for smart homes	21st International Conference on Advanced Networking and Applications Workshops/Symposia, Vol 2, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Advanced Networking and Applications	MAY 21-23, 2007	Niagara Falls, CANADA	IEEE Comp Soc TCDP, Nokia			MOBILE ROBOT	In this paper we investigate the problem of monitoring patients in an assisted living environment. We apply machine learning techniques for localization and tracking. We consider an environment such as a smart home, assisted living facility, or recovery unit that is equipped with tiny wireless devices which interact with a device carried by the patient. These indoor, multi-room environments are well suited to learning approaches as barriers usually inhibit the operation of systems which calculate location via ranging and multilateration. The location information can be logged over time to monitor a patient's activity. Based on data collected in experiments using real-life test beds, we conduct simulations comparing the location estimation accuracy of several learning algorithms.

Context recognition and in particular activity recognition is of key importance as it facilitates the interpretation of data from medical monitoring devices. In our study with five elderly or disabled people we used data from multi-sensor wearable devices to generate intra- and interindividual machine-learned classifier models to determine activity patterns. Furthermore we computed the relative relevance of each parameter measured, and assessed the acceptance of computerized questionnaires in computer-illiterate people. The mean classification accuracy was 91.4% for the intraindividual classifiers and 53.7% for the interindividual ones. The most relevant parameters for activity classifications were those derived from accelerometric data, the least relevant one was galvanic skin response. Both the sensor device and the computerized questionnaires were well-received by the study participants. Individually-trained machine-learned classifiers used on data from a wearable device are an adequate means to determine context in elderly or disabled people.

Developing a reliable machine learning method plays a very crucial role in this issue. For a typical problem in BCI, ERP detection task, the major method is to classify the input EEG time series into two classes; with a desired ERP/Cognitive Component and without that desired ERP/Cognitive Component. Any powerful feature extraction or classifier block that can do this task accurately, can be of a great help. In this study, a new classifier based on modular learning strategy and a new wavelet for feature extraction, will be introduced and compared with some other classifiers in two states; with GA and without GA, which shows a an improvement in classification accuracy.

In this paper present the comparison of different classification techniques using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis or in short, WEKA. WEKA is an open source software which consists of a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of different classification or clustering methods for a set of large data. The algorithm or methods tested are Bayes Network, Radial Basis Function, Pruned Tree, Single Conjunctive Rule Learner and Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. A fundamental review on the selected technique is presented for introduction purposes. The data breast cancer data with a total data of 6291 and a dimension of 699 rows and 9 columns will be used to test and justify the differences between the classification methods or algorithms. Subsequently, the classification technique that has the potential to significantly improve the common or conventional methods will be suggested for use in large scale data, bioinformatics or other general applications.

As a whole, SAS provides an integrated solution that includes on-body data capture, automatic recognition of soldier activity, and a multimedia interface that combines data search and exploration. The recognition component analyzes readings from six on-body accelerometers to identify activity. The activities are modeled by boosted ID classifiers, which allows efficient selection of the most useful features within the learning algorithm. We present empirical results based on data collected at Georgia Tech and at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds during official testing by a DARPA appointed NIST evaluation team. Our approach achieves 78.7% for continuous event recognition and 70.3% frame level accuracy. The accuracy increases to 90.3% and 90.3% respectively when considering only the modeled activities. In addition to standard error metrics, we discuss error division diagrams (EDDs) for several Aberdeen data sequences to provide a rich visual representation of the performance of our system.

One story is about AI as one of the big forces of innovation in information technology. It is now forgotten that initially computers were just viewed as calculating machines. AI has moved that boundary, by projecting visions on what might be possible, and by building technologies to realise them. Another story is about the applications of AI. Knowledge systems were still a rarity in the late seventies but are now everywhere, delivered through the web. Knowledge systems routinely deal with financial and legal problem solving, diagnosis and maintenance of power plants and transportation networks, symbolic mathematics, scheduling, etc. The innovative aspects of search engines like Google are almost entirely based on the information extraction, data mining, semantic networks and machine learning techniques pioneered in AI. Popular games like SimCity are straightforward applications of multi-agent systems. Sophisticated language processing capacities are now routinely embedded in text processing systems like Microsoft's Word. Tens of millions of people use AI technology every day, often without knowing it or without wondering how these information systems can do all these things. In this essay I will focus however on another story: AI as a contributor to the scientific study of mind.

This is because a majority of researchers in this field have focused on the synthesis of emotional speech rather than focusing on automating human emotion recognition. Many research groups have focused on how to improve the performance of the classifier they used for emotion recognition, and few work has been done on data pre-processing, such as the extraction and selection of a set of specifying acoustic features instead of using all the possible ones they had in hand. To work with well-selected acoustic features does not mean to delay the whole job, but this will save much time and resources by removing the irrelative information and reducing the high-dimension data calculation. In this paper, we developed an automatic feature selector based on a RF2TREE algorithm and the traditional C4.5 algorithm. RF2TREE applied here helped us to solve the problems that did not have enough data examples. The ensemble learning technique was applied to enlarge the original data set by building a bagged random forest to generate many virtual examples, and then the new data set was used to train a single decision tree, which selects the most efficient features to represent the speech signals for the emotion recognition. Finally, the output of the selector was a set of specifying acoustic features, produced by RF2TREE and a single decision tree.

By combining the advantages of two approaches, an original attribute reduction method is proposed in the paper. Moreover, it is applied into oil-gas prediction to solve the problems when support vector machine is directly employed. Experiments and results show the validity and feasibility of the algorithm suggested in the paper.

Dynamic feature selection for spam filtering using Support Vector Machine	6th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science in Conjunction with 1st IEEE/ACIS International Workshop on e-Activity	JUL 11-13, 2007	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE Comp Soc, Int Assoc Comp & Informat Sci		SVM; spam; FP; DFS; ML		Spam is commonly defined as unsolicited email messages and the goal of sparn filtering is to differentiate spam from legitimate email. Mach work have been done to filter spam from legitimate emails using machine learning algorithm and substantial performance has been achieved with some amount of false positive (FP) tradeoffs. In this paper, architecture of spam filtering has been proposed based on Support Vector Machine (SVM,) which will get better accuracy by reducing FP problems. In this architecture an innovative technique for feature selection called Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS) has been proposed which is enhanced the overall performance of the architecture with reduction of FP problems. The experimental result shows that the proposed technique gives better performance compare to similar existing techniques.

However, the effectiveness of the tutor's feedbacks on the learner varies from one learner to another. It depends essentially on the learner's traits and it is reflected in the learner's emotional reaction. Consequently, it is important to detect the learner's emotional reaction following the tutor's intervention in order to personalize the feedback type. Our proposal consists of a methodology, based on machine learning technique, able to predict the learner's emotional reaction starting from the analysis of descriptive variables of the learner's current situation, such as: personality, motivation and tutor's feedback type.

The learner model still remains non-exhaustive. Methods of data collection on the cognitive and emotional state of the learner often lack precision and objectivity. In this paper we introduce an emomental agent. It interacts with an ITS to communicate the emotional state of the learner based upon his mental state. The mental state is obtained from the learner's brainwaves. The agent learns to predict the learner's emotions by using machine learning techniques.

However, there's still two fundamental issues which have not been adequately addressed. The first is how to. choose the best independent modalities. The second is how are a set of modalities optimally fused to map to the high-level semantics. In this paper, statistical and machine learning techniques ISOMAP are applied to solve the two problems. Combining with support vector clustering, ISOMAP are first used to discover independent modalities from raw features. Then, Super Kernel method is applied to optimally fuse the individual modalities. Experiments show that the proposed method can learn multimedia semantics more efficiently than traditional methods.

In order to overcome these limitations, a supervised artificial immune classifier, UCAIS, is presented. The implementation of UCAIS includes: the first is to create a pool of memory cells. Then, B-cell population is evolved and the memory cells pool is updated until the stopping criterion is met. Finally, classification is accomplished by majority vote of the k nearest memory cells. Compared with AIRS, UCAIS not only reduces the huge size of evolved memory cells pool, but also improves the classification accuracy on the four famous datasets, the Iris dataset, the Ionosphere dataset, the Diabetes dataset, and the Sonar dataset.

In this paper, we propose a new support vector algorithm, called OC-K-SVM, for multi-class classification based on one-class SVM. For k-class problem, this method constructs k classifiers, where each one is trained on data from one class. OC-K-SVM has parameters that enable us to control the number of support vectors and margin errors effectively, which is helpful in improving the accuracy of each classifier. We give some theoretical results concerning the significance of the parameters and show the robustness of classifiers. In addition, we have examined the proposed algorithm on several benchmark data sets, and our preliminary experiments confirm our theoretical conclusions.

These approaches are potentially very efficient for simulating and analyzing physiological function of cells. In this work, entity grammar system is proposed as formalism for knowledge representation and multistratgy learning techniques in systems biology. Modeling biological cells with entity grammar starts from the simple grammatical models. Integrating the simple models into a cooperating entity grammar of cell facilitates real-time model learning and updating. This makes a difference with many other formalisms to build preset models. The scheme of such a platform is described in the paper and the possible applications are discussed. The proposed formalism method is open to all reasoning paradigm and can be used for studying biological complex systems.

In this paper, a model has been developed and presented to support this purpose i.e. making the knowledge base of a knowledge-driven DSS as self-incrementing. First, the necessity of such a model for maintaining knowledge currency and the importance of knowledge currency in the context of DSS supporting operational decision processes, are discussed. Then, a generic model is presented using customer-email as input knowledge sources, frames as a knowledge representation scheme, and Bolzmann machine as the self-incrementing mechanism. The model can be further extended or fine-tuned both in terms of the input options and process options. The input options can include other types of knowledge inputs with varying degrees of structuredness. The process options may include other algorithms and machine learning processes.

The system consists of a supervisory controller, and controllers for defending and goalkeeping robots. These controllers are designed using Petri net The robot soccer game presents an uncertain and dynamic environment for cooperating agents. Dynamic role switching and formation control are crucial for a successful game. A soccer robot has to take an appropriate decision based on environment situation. With the role of a robot fixed as goalkeeper, the supervisor, according to the game situation, assigns the role of attacking or defending to the other robots and then respective controllers control the robots. The Petri net model is implemented in Petri net toolbox under MATLAB environment.

The approach uses an Integrated Machine Learning System (IMLS) sethat uses an ontology of machine learning strategies to decide the appropriate strategy for a situation. This Integrated Machine Learning System is used to model the learning behavior of Students. Given the teaching material the IMLS uses its ontology of Machine Learning Strategies to identify which Machine Learning strategy is applicable for each situation in the learning process. The IMLS also records the alternative learning strategies that may be suggested for the situation. These solution states are represented in Plausible Justification Trees. One of these plausible justification trees will result in the error made by the student. The wrong learning strategy used ill that tree helps in identifying the learning error committed by the student.

Machine learning techniques for automatic classfication gains more interest as the classifier improves its performance with experience. In this paper we show that lazy learners are capable of solving the web page classification problem. Our experimental results show that lazy learners classify the web page with acceptable accuracy using optimum number of attributes and LBR classifies more accurately than LWL classifiers.	[Devi, M.

Extracting useful knowledge from such data collections is an important and challenging issue. A promising technique is the rough set theory, a new mathematical approach to data analysis based on classification of objects of interest into similarity classes, which are indiscernible with respect to some features. Rough set theory provides a formal framework for data mining. Feature selection is a preprocessing step in data mining, and it is very effective in reducing dimensionality, reducing irrelevant data, increasing learning accuracy and improving comprehensibility. In this paper, Quickreduct and the proposed Accelerated Quickreduct algorithms are first presented, followed by the C4.5 approach for rule induction. A comparative study is also performed with the proposed and Quickreduct algorithms. The experiments are carried out on public domain datasets available in UCI machine learning repository and the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV) data set to analyze the performance study.

This likely represents the initially attempt to perform analysis of such data by means of a machine learning technique. The variables employed include the gift amount to the university foundation (UF) as well as traditional demographic variables such as year of graduation, gender, ethnicity, marital status, etc, The UF serves as one of the institution's non-profit, fund-raising organizations. It pursues substantial gifts that are designated for the educational or leadership programs of the giver's choice. Although they process gifts of all sizes, the UF focus is on major gifts and endowments. The Association Analysis (AA) of the given dataset is a two-step process. In the first step, the data items that are frequently appear together (i.e. concepts) are systematically identified and in the second step, each concept is converted into a set of rules called association rules. The hypothesis examined in this paper is that the generosity of alumni toward his/her alma mater can be predicted using association rules obtained by applying the FCA approach.

Currently the adopted models in the on-condition maintenance field are proportional hazards model (PI-M4) and filtering model. Both of them have complex forms and complex calculation process, the estimation of parameters is established on an amount of sample. However support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine learning, method. It has the characters of simple structure, excellent learning capability and fitting in small sample. It also cart transfer the problem to the square regression problem. So it can get the best resolution in the public area. SVM is extended to the application of the regression estimation of system. Therefore, SVM is adopted in the condition residual life regression. And the algorithm of the realizing this method is proposed. Finally the predicted result of the example adopted SVM show that SVM can better solve the same kind of problem.

This paper presents an approach to automatically detect ECG arrhythmias using the neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions (NEWFM). NEWFM classifies normal and abnormal beats by the trained bounded sum of weighted fuzzy membership functions (BSWFMs) using normalized features in the range of [0, 1] from UCI repository of machine learning. The generalized 4 features, locally related to the time signal, are extracted by the non-overlap area measurement method. The total numbers of samples are 452 data. The 80% of the data are used for training and 20% for testing. The result of accuracy rate is 81.32%. The BSWFMs of the 4 features trained by NEWFM are shown visually, which makes the features interpret explicitly. Since each BSWFM combines multiple weighted fuzzy membership functions into one using bounded sum, the four small-sized BSWFMs can realize real-time ECG arrhythmias detection in mobile environment.

The area is innovative and under active research as a subset of Human Computer Interaction. Brain Computer Interfacing typically utilize Electroencephalogram (EEG) data to apply machine learning and or computational intelligence techniques to trigger actions. Electroencephalogram data is a multivariate time series data whose visualization suffers from problems like cluster overlapping and high dimensionality. In this paper we present a natural alternative to visualization i.e. sonification. Thus combining the two novel area of research to explore and get better results over the conventional approaches. Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information. We have presented a technique to sonify alpha, beta and gamma bands present in the Electroncephalogram data. Experiments have been performed on EEG data of a controlled subject and the results have been discussed at the end.

In this paper, we propose an ensemble text classification model combining classification rules and N-Gram language model. In order to generate strong classification rules, we propose an exhaustive noun-phrase extraction algorithm and a new optimized rule induction algorithm, called SCA (Strong Covering Algorithms). We also introduce an improved Good-Turing (GT) smoothing method for N-Gram model. Experimental results show that our ensemble classifier achieves an approximately 8% improvement as compared to bi-gram with word-based classifier and 15% improvement as compared to traditional rules-based classifier. In conclusion, the accuracy of ensemble classification model is competent to only a single classification models.

In this paper, we introduce a parallel version of the well-known AdaBoost algorithm to speed up and size up feature selection for binary classification tasks using large training datasets and a wide range of elementary features. This parallelization is done without any modification to the AdaBoost algorithm and designed for PC clusters using Java and the JavaSpace distributed framework. JavaSpace is a memory sharing paradigm implemented on top of a virtual shared memory, that appears both efficient and easy-to-use. Results and performances on a face detection system trained with the proposed parallel AdaBoost are presented.

Co-training is a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm that uses multiple weak classifiers with a relatively small amount of labeled data and incrementally uses unlabeled data. The assumption in co-training is that the classifiers can co-train each other, as one can label samples that are difficult for the other. The sentence segmentation problem is very appropriate for the co-training method since it satisfies the main requirements of the co-training algorithm: the dataset can be described by two disjoint and natural views that are redundantly sufficient. In our case, the feature sets are capturing lexical and prosodic information. ne experimental results on the ICSI Meeting (MRDA) corpus show the effectiveness of the co-training algorithm for this task.

Proteomics is one of the largest areas of focus in bioinformatics and data mining research. Protein structure prediction is one of the most crucial and decisive problem in all the areas of research. Protein secondary structure can be used for the determination of the tertiary structure via the fold recognition method. Hence, predicting the secondary structures from the protein's primary sequences has attracted the attention of many researchers. Experimental methods have proved to he complex and expensive. So to develop a simple and accurate method for structure prediction is of great importance. In this paper, a new method has been proposed based on the machine learning technique. The first step of this proposal is to find out frequent patterns of consecutive amino acids in a protein database. After this, a set of frequent words (feature set) is found. Then Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a binary/tertiary classifier for the classification of protein secondary structure with these frequent words.

It aims to adapt an agent to a given environment by utilizing a reward and a penalty. We know the Penalty Avoiding Rational Policy Making algorithm (PARP) [5] and the Penalty Avoiding Profit Sharing (PAPS) [6] as examples of RL systems that are able to suppress a penalty and learn a rational policy. However they cannot treat multiple penalties. In this paper, we extend PARP/PAPS to the environments where there are some kinds of penalties. We propose the Penalty Avoiding Rational Policy Making Algorithm with Penalty Level (PARP(L)) that can control how to avoid penalties. We show the effectiveness of PARPL by soccer game simulations.

It knowledge can be described as one set of rules in the form B -> H, where B is the rule body and H the rule class. In this form, a rule can be evaluated taking contingency table as standard base, of which can be calculated absolute values (cardinalities) and covering and accuracy rules measures. Small Disjunct is a rule that cover a small number of examples. It correctly classify individually only few examples but, collectively, cover a significant percentage of the set of examples. In this way, discover small disjuncts groups can be important to identify some interesting points like if different small disjuncts can have the same rule class. In this paper covering and accuracy measures are used to identify small disjuncts groups.

Early detection of faults increases the window of opportunity to schedule maintenance actions both at a convenient time and before the fault progresses and causes equipment downtime and secondary damage to the system. Typically, diagnostic models are built using parametric sensor data to infer the state of the system. However, recording and collecting this data is costly, and it is generally limited to a few snapshots over the course of a flight for commercial aircraft. Another way to recognize faults is through the use of built-in tests that produce error log messages. These tests produce data that is less information rich, but provide insight over the course of the entire flight. Each data source provides a different perspective of the state of the system. Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine information from parametric and nonparametric sources to improve fault diagnosis in terms of accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis. In this paper, we investigate integrating parametric sensor data and nonparametric information in fault diagnosis, specifically the way to parameterize nonparametric information for use in diagnostic models that accept only parametric data (e.g., most machine learning techniques). Results from high bypass commercial engines are presented.

For its outstanding power to summarize the data space in a concise way, incremental SVM framework is designed to deal with large-scale learning problems. The paper presents a new dynamic construction algorithm of incremental SVM learning. The clustering method is used to judge the relativity of new data streams and history ones, and then multiple SVM classifiers are constructed. The feature space is partitioned according to the performance of each classifier, and the statistical characters on each region are counted. The classifier that has the best performance on the region near the input sample is selected as the final output. The experimental results confirm the feasibility and validity of the proposed algorithm.

Although the relation between the kernel density estimation (KDE) and low-pass filtering is well known, it is vary difficult to setting the parameters of the other kinds of density, functions. This paper proposes a novel method to deal with the parameters of Laplace kernel through measuring the degree of exchanged information among interpolating points.

The classification method is divided into three main stages. The first one consists of locating and matching the astronomical objects in the multi-spectral images. In the second stage we create a compact representation of each object applying principal component analysis to the images. In the last stage we classify the astronomical objects using locally weighted linear regression and a novel oversampling algorithm to deal with the unbalance that is inherent to this class of problems. Our experimental results show that our method performs accurate classification using small training sets and in the presence of significant class unbalance.

It is the first step toward video-content analysis and content-based video retrieval. We develop a hierarchical approach for shot boundary detection based on the assumption that hierarchy helps to take decisions by reducing the amount of indeterminate transitions. Our method consists in first detecting abrupt transitions using a learning-based approach, then non-abrupt transitions are split into gradual transitions and normal frames. We describe in this paper, a machine learning system for shot boundary detection. The core of this system is a kernel-based SVM classifier.

SVM-CAC uses a service vector and a network vector to predict admission state. QoS metric function compares with some thresholds to determine the admission state. The threshold value can reveal biases of services. SVM-CAC combines policy and SVM's advantages when making admission decisions, so it can take into account the business requirement, external network QoS resource and can reduce algorithm complexity.

We present a distributed adaptive localization method that we refer to as: Map-based Adaptive Positioning (MAP). The main idea is to construct a relative local map at every node in the network, consisting of the node itself and its immediate neighbors, and merge the local maps together to form a global map. We consider two algorithms that can be used to estimate the relative local maps: multidimensional scaling (MDS) and semidefinite programming (SDP). The performance of these algorithms depend on two parameters: size of a local map, i.e., number of nodes, and the average connectivity of the node at the center of the local map and its 1-hop neighbors. We use machine learning to adaptively select the appropriate algorithm to estimate the relative local maps. Simulation results show that MAP outperforms both MDS and SDP, with better improvement for networks with less uniform node deployment.

We present a feature extraction and classification framework that operates on features that can be extracted from image files in a very fast fashion. The features considered are thoroughly analyzed regarding their information gain. We present classification performance results for C4.5 decision tree and support vector machine classifiers. Lastly, we compare the performance that can be achieved using these fast features to a more complex image classifier operating on morphological features extracted from fully decoded images. The proposed classifier is able to detect a large amount of malicious images while being computationally inexpensive.

Medium term horizon Market Clearing Price and load forecasting with an improved dual unscented Kalman filter	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND AUTOMATION, VOLS 1-7			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2007	Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		price prediction; load forecasting; deregulation; electric power market; artificial neural network; unscented filtering	NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION	The deregulation of electric power supply industries has raised many challenging problems. One of the most important ones is forecasting the Market Clearing Price (MCP) of electricity. Decisions on various issues, such as to buy or sell electricity and to offer a transaction to the market, require accurate knowledge of the MCP. Another problem, which has also been an important issue of the traditional power systems, is load forecasting for both short and long terms. The extended kalman filter has been widely adopted for state estimation of nonlinear systems, machine learning applications and neural network training. In the EKF, the state distribution is approximated by the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. Therefore this can introduce large errors in the load and price forecasting as two Chaotic, nonstationary and nonlinear time-series. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), in contrast, achieves third-order accuracy, by using a minimal set of MCP and load sigma points. In this paper an improved dual unscented Kalman filter (DUKF), which estimate state and parameter simultaneously has been applied to the real New England power market. The numerical stability and more accurate predictions of our method is comparable to the EKF, and traditional neural network training methods. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the DUKF is the same order as that of the EKF. The obtained results show significant improvement in both price and load forecasting.

In this paper, we present a parallel, approximate matrix factorization algorithm, which loads only essential data to individual processors to enable parallel processing of data. Our method reduces space requirement for the kernel matrix from O(n(2)) to O(np/m), where n is the amount of data, p the reduced matrix dimension (p << n), and m the number of processors.

This work presents two new sparsity control methods for 1-norm support vector classification. The first scheme, called SVC-sc1, is formulated by adding a penalty term in the objective function, whereas the second scheme, called SVC-sc2, is obtained by adding an extra inequality to the original optimization problem. The common goal is to reduce the number of retained support vectors. Besides mathematical formulation, we present test results on the benchmark Ripley data set. The experimental results indicate that both schemes outperform the conventional SVC, whereas SVC-sc2 has a still better performance than SVC-sc1.

Instead of simulating the swing trajectories and checking for collisions along them, our approach uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a swing trajectory is collision-free. Using a set of local terrain features, we apply supervised learning to train a classifier to predict collisions. Both in simulation and on a real quadruped platform, our results show that our classifiers can improve the accuracy of collision detection compared to a real-time geometric approach without significantly increasing the computation time.

The aim of this study was to discover significant rules discriminating ER+ and ER-cases of breast cancer. We compared both statistical accuracy and biological validity of the results using common statistical methods and Gene Ontology. Some worth noting characteristics of these systems have been observed and analysed even giving some possible interpretations of findings. With this study we tried to show how intelligent systems can be employed in the design of experimental pipeline in disease processes investigation and how deriving high-throughput results can be validated using new computational tools. Results returned by this approach seem to encourage new efforts in this field.

Support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning technique, is one of the methods successfully applied to cancer diagnosis problems. This study proposes an SVM-based classifier with automatic feature selection associated with a boosting strategy. The proposed boosting evolutionary support vector machine (named BESVM) hybridizes the advantages of SVM, boosting using a majority-voting ensemble and an intelligent genetic algorithm for gene selection. The merits of the BESVM-based classifier are threefold: 1) a small set of used genes, 2) accurate test classification using leave-one-out cross-validation, and 3) robust performance by avoiding overfitting training data. Five benchmark datasets were used to evaluate the BESVM-based classifier. Simulation results reveal that BESVM performs well having a mean accuracy 94.26% using only 10.1 genes averagely, compared with the existing SVM and non-SVM based classifiers.

In real life, control engineers and machine learning researchers are often faced with the problem of how to design a good objective function to let the agent attain an intended goal efficiently and reliably.

For this purpose, new adaptive algorithms for the computation of the square root of the inverse covariance matrix Sigma(-1/2) are introduced. We introduce a new cost function related to the given adaptive learning algorithms in order to prove their convergence. Self organized Sigma(-1/2) networks are constructed based on these algorithms. By cascading Sigma(-1/2) network and an adaptive principal component analysis (APCA) network, we present new adaptive self organized LDA feature extraction network. Adaptive nature of the new optimal feature extraction method makes it appropriate for on-line incremental pattern classification and machine learning applications. Both networks in the proposed structure are trained simultaneously, using a stream of input data. Existence of cost function, make it available to compute learning rate efficiently in every iteration in order to increase the convergence rate. Experimental results using synthetic multi-class multi-dimensional sequence of data, demonstrated the effectiveness of the new adaptive self organized feature extraction networks.

Prediction of oxidoreductase-catalyzed reactions based on atomic properties of metabolites	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							RESIDUAL ELECTRONEGATIVITY; XENOBIOTIC METABOLISM; SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; METABOLOMICS; PATHWAYS; NETWORKS; DATABASE; PROGRAM; NUMBERS; META	Motivation: Our knowledge of metabolism is far from complete, and the gaps in our knowledge are being revealed by metabolomic detection of small-molecules not previously known to exist in cells. An important challenge is to determine the reactions in which these compounds participate, which can lead to the identification of gene products responsible for novel metabolic pathways. To address this challenge, we investigate how machine learning can be used to predict potential substrates and products of oxidoreductase-catalyzed reactions. Results: We examined 1956 oxidation/reduction reactions in the KEGG database. The vast majority of these reactions (1626) can be divided into 12 subclasses, each of which is marked by a particular type of functional group transformation. For a given transformation, the local structures of reaction centers in substrates and products can be characterized by patterns. These patterns are not unique to reactants but are widely distributed among KEGG metabolites. To distinguish reactants from non-reactants, we trained classifiers (linear-kernel Support Vector Machines) using negative and positive examples. The input to a classifier is a set of atomic features that can be determined from the 2D chemical structure of a compound. Depending on the subclass of reaction, the accuracy of prediction for positives (negatives) is 64 to 93% (44 to 92%) when asking if a compound is a substrate and 71 to 98% (50 to 92%) when asking if a compound is a product. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this performance is robust to variations of the training data. Our results suggest that metabolic connectivity can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from the presence or absence of local structural motifs in compounds and their readily calculated atomic features.

Using six anomaly-associated risk factors identified from previous studies, the latent class model based oil ail unlabeled sample yielded acceptable classification results compared with a logistic regression model based on a labeled sample (correctly classified: 0.95 vs. 0.98, sensitivity: 0.99 vs. 0.99, and specificity: 0.77 vs. 0.97). The study demonstrates a great potency for using the latent class modeling technique to analyze network traffic data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to narrow this gap, it is vitally important to develop a computational prediction method for fast and accurately determining the protein structural class. In this paper, a novel predictor is developed for predicting protein structural class. It is featured by employing a support vector machine learning system and using a different pseudoamino acid composition (PseAA), which was introduced to, to some extent, take into account the sequence-order effects to represent protein samples. As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation test was performed on a working dataset that contains 204 nonhomologous proteins. The predicted results are very encouraging, indicating that the current predictor featured with the PseAA may play an important complementary role to the elegant covariant discriminant predictor and other existing algorithms.

Inbred mouse strains have been useful for the study of the genetic basis of various drug addiction-related phenotypes. Inbred Long-Sleep ( ILS) and Inbred Short-Sleep ( ISS) mice differentially express a number of genes thought to be implicated in sensitivity to the effects of ethanol. Concomitantly, there is evidence for a mediating role of cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling in aspects of alcoholism modelled in animals. In this report, the extent to which CREB signalling impacts the differential expression of genes in ILS and ISS mouse cerebella is examined. Results: A training dataset for Machine Learning ( ML) and Exploratory Data Analyses ( EDA) was generated from promoter region sequences of a set of genes known to be targets of CREB transcription regulation and a set of genes whose transcription regulations are potentially CREB-independent. For each promoter sequence, a vector of size 132, with elements characterizing nucleotide composition features was generated. Genes whose expressions have been previously determined to be increased in ILS or ISS cerebella were identified, and their CREB regulation status predicted using the ML scheme C4.5. The C4.5 learning scheme was used because, of four ML schemes evaluated, it had the lowest predicted error rate. On an independent evaluation set of 21 genes of known CREB regulation status, C4.5 correctly classified 81% of instances with F-measures of 0.87 and 0.67 respectively for the CREB-regulated and CREB-independent classes. Additionally, six out of eight genes previously determined by two independent microarray platforms to be up-regulated in the ILS or ISS cerebellum were predicted by C4.5 to be transcriptionally regulated by CREB. Furthermore, 64% and 52% of a cross-section of other up-regulated cerebellar genes in ILS and ISS mice, respectively, were deemed to be CREB-regulated. Conclusion: These observations collectively suggest that ethanol sensitivity, as it relates to the cerebellum, may be associated with CREB transcription activity.

J	Thrun, S				Thrun, Sebastian			A personal account of the development of Stanley, the robot that won the DARPA Grand Challenge	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article							TERRAIN AUTONOMOUS MOBILITY	This article is my personal account on the work at Stanford on Stanley, the winning robot in the DARPA Grand Challenge. Between July 2004 and October 2005, my then-postdoc Michael Montemerlo and I led a team of students, engineers, and professionals with the single vision of claiming one of the most prestigious trophies in the field of robotics: the DARPA Grand Challenge (DARPA 2004).(1) The Grand Challenge, organized by the U.S. government, was unprecedented in the nation's history. It was the first time that the U.S. Congress had appropriated a cash price for advancing technological innovation. My team won this prize, competing with some 194 other teams. Stanley was the fastest of five robotic vehicles that, on October 8, 2005, successfully navigated a 131.6-mile-long course through California's Mojave Desert. This essay is not about the technology behind our success; for that I refer the interested reader to recent articles on the technical aspects of Stanley (Dahlkamp et al. 2006; Montemerlo et al. 2006; Stavens and Thrun 2006; Thrun, Montemerlo, and Aron 2006; Thrun et al. 2006). Instead, this is my personal story of leading the Stanford Racing Team. It is the story of a team of people who built an autonomous robot in record time. It is also a success story for the field of artificial intelligence, as Stanley used some state of the art Al methods in areas such as probabilistic inference, machine learning, and computer vision. Of course, it is also the story of a step towards a technology that, one day, might fundamentally change our lives.

J	Wang, SR; Dash, M; Chia, LT; Xu, M				Wang, Surong; Dash, Manoranjan; Chia, Liang-Tien; Xu, Min			Efficient data reduction in multimedia data	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						sampling; image classification; audio event identification; association rule mining		As the amount of multimedia data is increasing day-by-day thanks to cheaper storage devices and increasing number of information sources, the machine learning algorithms are faced with large-sized datasets. When original data is huge in size small sample sizes are preferred for various applications. This is typically the case for multimedia applications. But using a simple random sample may not obtain satisfactory results because such a sample may not adequately represent the entire data set due to random fluctuations in the sampling process. The difficulty is particularly apparent when small sample sizes are needed. Fortunately the use of a good sampling set for training can improve the final results significantly. In KDD'03 we proposed EASE that outputs a sample based on its 'closeness' to the original sample. Reported results show that EASE outperforms simple random sampling (SRS). In this paper we propose EASIER that extends EASE in two ways. (1) EASE is a halving algorithm, i.e., to achieve the required sample ratio it starts from a suitable initial large sample and iteratively halves. EASIER, on the other hand, does away with the repeated halving by directly obtaining the required sample ratio in one iteration. (2) EASE was shown to work on IBM QUEST dataset which is a categorical count data set. EASIER, in addition, is shown to work on continuous data of images and audio features. We have successfully applied EASIER to image classification and audio event identification applications. Experimental results show that EASIER outperforms SRS significantly.

Using self-organizing maps to explore patterns in species richness and protection	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						conservation; gap analysis; landscape metrics; Self-Organizing Maps (SOM); species richness	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; LANDSCAPE METRICS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; SCALE; BIODIVERSITY; PREDICTION; ORDINATION	The combination of species distributions with abiotic and landscape variables using Geographic Information Systems can prioritize areas for biodiversity protection by identifying areas of high richness, although the number of variables and complexity of the relationships between them can prove difficult for traditional statistical methods. The use of these methods, which commonly assume linearity and low correlation between independent variables, can obscure even strong relationships and patterns. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) is a heuristic statistical tool based on machine learning methods that can be used to explore patterns in large, complex datasets for linear and nonlinear patterns. Here we use SOM to visualize broad patterns in species richness by taxonomic group (birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians) and 78 habitat, landscape and environmental variables using data from the Gap analysis project for West Virginia, USA. Soil and habitat variables demonstrated clear relationships with species richness; areas with high species richness occurred in areas with high soil richness. Landscape metrics were less important, although habitat diversity and evenness indices were positively related to species richness in some taxonomic groups. Current coverage of protected areas (e.g., National Forests and state parks) appeared to be insufficient to cover most of the areas of high species richness, especially for reptiles; many of the polygons with the highest richness were not covered by these areas. The identification of polygons with high richness and low protection can be used to focus conservation efforts in those areas.

Sizing the effect of environmental distributions on unsupervised learning	COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	26th Annual Meeting of the Societe-Quebecoise-pour-la-Recherche-en-Psychologie	2003	Montreal, CANADA	Soc Quebecoise Rech Psychol		artificial neural networks; connectionist networks; associative memories; competitive networks; density estimation	ADAPTIVE PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; CATEGORIZATION; MEMORY; RECOGNITION; FREQUENCY; SIMILARITY	Learning environmental biases is a rational behavior: by using prior odds, Bayesian networks rapidly became a benchmark in machine learning. Moreover, a growing body of evidence now suggests that humans are using base rate information. Unsupervised connectionist networks are used in computer science for machine learning and in psychology to model human cognition, but it is unclear whether they are sensitive to prior odds. In this paper, we show that hard competitive learners are unable to use environmental biases while recurrent associative memories use frequency of exemplars and categories independently. Hence, it is concluded that recurrent associative memories are more useful than hard competitive networks to model human cognition and have a higher potential in machine learning.

A knowledge discovery method to predict the economical sustainability of a company	CONCURRENT ENGINEERING-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						machine learning; knowledge discovery in databases; symbolic data; logistical performance; decision tool		In this study, we are building a prototype of a machine-learning system using an inductive supervised approach to predict the logistical performance of a company. Focus lies on the learning phase, the handling of different types of data, the creation of new concepts in order to provide better measurable information. In this system, numeric financial data are combined with categorical data creating symbolic data, distinguishing the phase of model generation from examples, and the phase of model classification and interpretation. The system has been implemented in vector spaces. Our data are benchmarking surveys on concurrent engineering (CE), measuring the usage of in total 302 best practices in Belgian manufacturing companies. The general purpose for implementing a best practice is the statement that the company will improve its product processing, and that in this way the company will establish its economical existence on the market. Our model processes a limited number of predefined steps, generating value factors for the 302 best practices. The best practices are grouped into 30 subjects, the value factors combined in linear combinations. These value factors and their linear combinations are then subject to pattern interpretation relating CE performance to the past financial state of the company and, also to the economical well-doing of the company in the longer term i.e., we also refer to the sustainability of the company in the market.

J	Fan, WG; Pathak, P; Wallace, L				Fan, Weiguo; Pathak, Praveen; Wallace, Linda			Nonlinear ranking function representations in genetic programming-based ranking discovery for personalized search	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						information routing; information retrieval; genetic programming; ranking function	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; RELEVANCE FEEDBACK; WEB SEARCH; ALGORITHMS; QUERY; FRAMEWORK	Ranking function is instrumental in affecting the performance of a search engine. Designing and optimizing a search engine's ranking function remains a daunting task for computer and information scientists. Recently, genetic programming (GP), a machine learning technique based on evolutionary theory, has shown promise in tackling this very difficult problem. Ranking functions discovered by GP have been found to be significantly better than many of the other existing ranking functions. However, current GP implementations for ranking function discovery are all designed utilizing the Vector Space model in which the same term weighting strategy is applied to all terms in a document. This may not be an ideal representation scheme at the individual query level considering the fact that many query terms should play different roles in the final ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear ranking function representation scheme and compare this new design to the well-known Vector Space model. We theoretically show that the new representation scheme subsumes the traditional Vector Space model representation scheme as a special case and hence allows for additional flexibility in term weighting. We test the new representation scheme with the GP-based discovery framework in a personalized search (information routing) context using a TREC web corpus. The experimental results show that the new ranking function representation design outperforms the traditional Vector Space model for GP-based ranking function discovery. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

There have been many intrusion detection schemes proposed, most of which apply both normal and intrusion data to construct classifiers. However, normal data and intrusion data are often imbalanced because intrusive connection data are usually difficult to collect. Internet intrusion detection can be considered as a novelty detection problem, which is the identification of new or unknown data, to which a learning system has not been exposed during training. In this paper, a novelty detection based intrusion detection system is proposed by combining the self-organization (SOM) and a kernel auto-associator (KAA) model. SOM organizes prototypes of samples while the KAA provides data description for the normal connection. The novelty detector can also be applied for classification in the recognition of different types of attacks. Using the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, the performance of the proposed scheme in separating normal connections from intrusive connections was compared with some other novelty detection methods such as the auto-encoder, showing much improvement in terms of the high intrusion detection accuracy and low false positives. Simulations on the classification of attack categories demonstrate high accuracies and low cost per example.

The result that the environment affects economy is complex black-box-problem. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a new machine learning method based on Statistical Learning Theory (SLT). It has good performances in dealing with non-linear modeling and high dimensional problems, and the learning results possess stronger robustness. In this paper, key indicators of environment are selected to forecast GDP of Hebei province by non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR). Compared with neural network, linear SVR and Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS), non-linear SVR has simple mathematical model and high forecast precision in solving the problem of the forecast model for sustainable development of Economy-Environment system. Thus we can draw a conclusion that environment plays an important role in the sustainable development of economy.

As a type of promising theory, artificial immune system (also called AIS) gradually becomes the research hotspot in related application fields. Its powerful information processing capacity often brings us new inspirations to solve real-world problems. For clustering analysis, AIS is employed to decrease the time complexity of handling original data, which results in simplifying the process of data processing and enhancing the computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose an improved approach to data clustering based on AIS. The efficiency evaluation is established for different datasets and parameters. The results show that the approach presented in this paper outperforms the classic aiNet.

Recently, artificial immune system developed quickly due to its powerful capability of information processing. The specific mechanisms of immune system make it possible to compress data and discover patterns. Meanwhile, support vector machine is an excellent approach for classification, regression and clustering. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to data clustering by combining artificial immune system with support vector machine.

J	Chen, CM; Lee, HM; Tan, CC				Chen, Chih-Ming; Lee, Hahn-Ming; Tan, Chia-Chen			An intelligent web-page classifier with fair feature-subset selection	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						feature selection; Web page classification; machine learning		The explosion of on-line information has given rise to many manually constructed topic hierarchies (such as Yahoo!!). But with the current growth rate in the amount of information, manual classification in topic hierarchies results in an immense information bottleneck. Therefore, developing an automatic classifier is an urgent need. However, classifiers suffer from enormous dimensionality, since the dimensionality is determined by the number of distinct keywords in a document corpus. More seriously, most classifiers are either working slowly or they are constructed subjectively without any learning ability. In this paper, we address these problems with a fair feature-subset selection (FFSS) algorithm and an adaptive fuzzy learning network (AFLN) for classification. The FFSS algorithm is used to reduce the enormous dimensionality. It not only gives fair treatment to each category but also has ability to identify useful features, including both positive and negative features. On the other hand, the AFLN provides extremely fast learning ability to model the uncertain behavior for classification so as to correct the fuzzy matrix automatically. Experimental results show that both FFSS algorithm and the AFLN lead to a significant improvement in document classification, compared to alternative approaches. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The procedure applies to data gathered in person-to-person communication. The procedure relies on the knowledge of the processes that govern such communication. It is general enough to represent data in a wide variety of domains. We present a case study of electronic negotiation, in which participants exchange text messages. We present the empirical results of classifying the outcomes of electronic negotiations based on such texts. The results achieved using process-specific feature selection are marginally better than those afforded by several traditional feature selection methods. We show that this tendency is consistent across several learning paradigms.

Spatio-temporal processing for multichannel biosensors using support vector machines	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						biosensors; conductometric immunosensor; electrochemical immunoassay; machine learning; polyaniline; support vector machines (SVMs)	DISPOSABLE BIOSENSOR	Rapid-response biosensing systems are necessary to counteract theats due to foreign and high-consequence pathogens. A yes/no multichannel biosensor is an important tool that enables simultaneous detection of different pathogens, independent of their relative concentration level. This paper proposes a novel multichannel biosensing technique, which combines multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) with multichannel immunosensors. The method combines spatial and temporal information generated by the multichannel immunosensor for rapid and reliable discrimination between pathogens of interest. This paper demonstrates that by including temporal and cross-reactive spatial signatures, the accuracy of the system can be improved at low pathogen concentration levels and for discrimination between closely related strains of pathogens. Compensation of systematic and biosensor fabrication errors is achieved by the use of a supervised SVM training which is also used in system calibration. Experimental results, with a prototype multichannel biosensor used for discriminating strains of E.-coli (K12 and O157:H7) and Salmonella enterica serovar Thompson, show an accuracy of 98% for concentration levels, 10(0)-10(8) colony forming units per milliliter, and total detection time of less than 6 min.

We propose a scheme for representing content of an image as a combination of features from multiple examples. This scheme is exploited for developing a multiple example-based retrieval engine. We have explored the use of machine learning techniques for generating the most appropriate feature combination scheme for a given class of images. The combination scheme can be used for developing purposive query engines for specialized image databases. Here, we have considered facial image databases.

J	Zhai, YH; Liu, B				Zhai, Yanhong; Liu, Bing			Structured data extraction from the web based on partial tree alignment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Web data extraction; wrapper generation; partial tree alignement; Web mining	SEQUENCES	This paper studies the problem of structured data extraction from arbitrary Web pages. The objective of the proposed research is to automatically segment data records in a page, extract data items/fields from these records, and store the extracted data in a database. Existing methods addressing the problem can be classified into three categories. Methods in the first category provide some languages to facilitate the construction of data extraction systems. Methods in the second category use machine learning techniques to learn wrappers (which are data extraction programs) from human labeled examples. Manual labeling is time-consuming and is hard to scale to a large number of sites on the Web. Methods in the third category are based on the idea of automatic pattern discovery. However, multiple pages that conform to a common schema are usually needed as the input. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective technique (called DEPTA) to perform the task of Web data extraction automatically. The method consists of two steps: 1) identifying individual records in a page and 2) aligning and extracting data items from the identified records. For step 1, a method based on visual information and tree matching is used to segment data records. For step 2, a novel partial alignment technique is proposed. This method aligns only those data items in a pair of records that can be aligned with certainty, making no commitment on the rest of the items. Experimental results obtained using a large number of Web pages from diverse domains show that the proposed two-step technique is highly effective.

Customized generalization of support patterns for classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						customized classification; machine learning; support patterns (SPs)		We propose a novel classification learning method called customized support pattern learner (CSPL). Given an instance to be classified, CSPL explores and discovers support patterns (SPs), which are essentially attribute value subsets of the instance to be classified. The final prediction of the class label is performed by combining some statistics of the discovered useful SPs. One advantage of the CSPL method is that it can explore a richer hypothesis space and discover useful classification patterns involving attribute values with almost indistinguishable information gain. The customized learning characteristic also allows that the target class can vary for different instances to be classified. It facilitates extremely easy training instance maintenance and updates. We have evaluated our method with real-world problems and benchmark data sets. The results demonstrate that CSPL can achieve good performance and high reliability.

J	Mitchell, S				Mitchell, Steve			Machine assistance in collection building: New tools, research, issues, and reflections	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES			English	Review							CLASSIFICATION	Digital tool making offers many challenges, involving much trial and error. Developing machine learning and assistance in automated and semi-automated Internet resource discovery, metadata generation, and rich-text identification provides opportunities for great discovery, innovation, and the potential for transformation of the library community. The areas of computer science involved, as applied to the library applications addressed, are among that discipline's leading edges. Making applied research practical and applicable, through placement within library/collection-management systems and services, involves equal parts computer scientist, research librarian, and legacy-systems archaeologist. Still, the early harvest is there for us now, with a large harvest pending. Data Fountains and iVia, the projects discussed, demonstrate this. Clearly, then, the present would be a good time for the library community to more proactively and significantly engage with this technology and research, to better plan for its impacts, to more proactively take up the challenges involved in its exploration, and to better and more comprehensively guide effort in this new territory. The alternative to doing this is that others will develop this territory for us, do it not as well, and sell it back to us at a premium. Awareness of this technology and its current capabilities, promises, limitations, and probable major impacts needs to be generalized throughout the library management, metadata, and systems communities. This article charts recent work, promising avenues for new research and development, and issues the library community needs to understand.

We hope their insights will inspire new research efforts, and give young researchers (including PhD students) a high-level guideline as to where the hot problems are located in data mining. Due to the limited amount of time, we were only able to send out our survey requests to the organizers of the IEEE ICDM and ACM KDD conferences, and we received an overwhelming response. We are very grateful for the contributions provided by these researchers despite their busy schedules. This short article serves to summarize the 10 most challenging problems of the 14 responses we have received from this survey. The order of the listing does not reflect their level of importance.

Intelligent evolutionary design: A new approach to optimizing complex engineering systems and its application to designing heat exchangers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							MODEL	A new method for optimizing complex engineering designs is presented that is based on the Learnable Evolution Model (LEM), a recently developed form of non-Darwinian evolutionary computation. Unlike conventional Darwinian-type methods that execute an unguided evolutionary process, the proposed method, called LEMd, guides the evolutionary design process using a combination of two methods, one involving computational intelligence and the other involving encoded expert knowledge. Specifically, LEMd integrates two modes of operation, Learning Mode and Probing Mode. Learning Mode applies a machine learning program to create new designs through hypothesis generation and instantiation, whereas Probing Mode creates them by applying expert- suggested design modification operators tailored to the specific design problem. The LEMd method has been used to implement two initial systems, ISHED I and ISCODI, specialized for the optimization of evaporators and condensers in cooling systems, respectively. The designs produced by these systems matched or exceeded in performance the best designs developed by human experts. These promising results and the generality of the presented method suggest that LEMd offers a powerful new tool for optimizing complex engineering systems. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Satellite-based precipitation estimation using watershed segmentation and growing hierarchical self-organizing map	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; RAINFALL ESTIMATION; PASSIVE MICROWAVE; INFRARED DATA; RESOLUTION; CLOUD; ALGORITHMS; SYSTEM	This paper outlines the development of a multi-satellite precipitation estimation methodology that draws on techniques from machine learning and morphology to produce high-resolution, short-duration rainfall estimates in an automated fashion. First, cloud systems are identified from geostationary infrared imagery using morphology based watershed segmentation algorithm. Second, a novel pattern recognition technique, growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM), is used to classify clouds into a number of clusters with hierarchical architecture. Finally, each cloud cluster is associated with co-registered passive microwave rainfall observations through a cumulative histogram matching approach. The network was initially trained using remotely sensed geostationary infrared satellite imagery and hourly ground-radar data in lieu of a dense constellation of polar-orbiting spacecraft such as the proposed global precipitation measurement (GPM) mission. Ground-radar and gauge rainfall measurements were used to evaluate this technique for both warm (June 2004) and cold seasons (December 2004-February 2005) at various temporal (daily and monthly) and spatial (0.04 degrees and 0.25 degrees) scales. Significant improvements of estimation accuracy are found classifying the clouds into hierarchical sub-layers rather than a single layer. Furthermore, 2-year (2003-2004) satellite rainfall estimates generated by the current algorithm were compared with gauge-corrected Stage IV radar rainfall at various time scales over continental United States. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the watershed segmentation and the GHSOM in satellite-based rainfall estimations.

In the absence of structural information from X-ray or NMR experiments, deriving informative descriptors can be difficult. We have developed feature-map vectors (FMVs), a new class of descriptors based on chemical features, to address this challenge. FMVs, which are derived from the conformational models of a few actives, are low dimensional, problem specific, and highly interpretable. By using shape-based alignments and scoring with chemical features, FMVs can combine information about a molecule's shape and the pharmacophores it can match. In five validation studies, bag classifiers built using FMVs have shown high enrichments for identifying actives for five diverse targets: CDK2, 5-HT3, DHFR, thrombin, and ACE. The interpretability of these descriptors has been demonstrated for CDK2 and 5-HT3, where the method automatically discovers the standard literature pharmacophore.

Analysis of reproductive performance of lactating cows on large dairy farms using machine learning algorithms	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						machine learning; alternating decision tree; fertility; dairy cattle	MILK-PRODUCTION; BODY CONDITION; NATURAL SERVICE; HEAT-STRESS; CATTLE; FERTILITY; HOLSTEIN; HERDS; MANAGEMENT; WISCONSIN	The fertility of lactating dairy cows is economically important, but the mean reproductive performance of Holstein cows has declined during the past 3 decades. Traits such as first-service conception rate and pregnancy status at 150 d in milk ( DIM) are influenced by numerous explanatory factors common to specific farms or individual cows on these farms. Machine learning algorithms offer great flexibility with regard to problems of multicollinearity, missing values, or complex interactions among variables. The objective of this study was to use machine learning algorithms to identify factors affecting the reproductive performance of lactating Holstein cows on large dairy farms. This study used data from farms in the Alta Genetics Advantage progeny-testing program. Production and reproductive records from 153 farms were obtained from on-farm DHI-Plus, Dairy Comp 305, or PCDART herd management software. A survey regarding management, facilities, labor, nutrition, reproduction, genetic selection, climate, and milk production was completed by managers of 103 farms; body condition scores were measured by a single evaluator on 63 farms; and temperature data were obtained from nearby weather stations. The edited data consisted of 31,076 lactation records, 14,804 cows, and 317 explanatory variables for first-service conception rate and 17,587 lactation records, 9,516 cows, and 341 explanatory variables for pregnancy status at 150 DIM. An alternating decision tree algorithm for first-service conception rate classified 75.6% of records correctly and identified the frequency of hoof trimming maintenance, type of bedding in the dry cow pen, type of cow restraint system, and duration of the voluntary waiting period as key explanatory variables. An alternating decision tree algorithm for pregnancy status at 150 DIM classified 71.4% of records correctly and identified bunk space per cow, temperature for thawing semen, percentage of cows with low body condition scores, number of cows in the maternity pen, strategy for using a clean-up bull, and milk yield at first service as key factors.

J	Moser, B				Moser, Bernhard			On representing and generating kernels by fuzzy equivalence relations	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						kernel; triangular norm; T-transitivity; fuzzy relation; residuum	INDISTINGUISHABILITY OPERATORS; POINCARE PARADOX; PARTITIONS; TRANSITIVITY; MODELS	Kernels are two-placed functions that can be interpreted as inner products in some Hilbert space. It is this property which makes kernels predestinated to carry linear models of learning, optimization or classification strategies over to non-linear variants. Following this idea, various kernel-based methods like support vector machines or kernel principal component analysis have been conceived which prove to be successful for machine learning, data mining and computer vision applications. When applying a kernel-based method a central question is the choice and the design of the kernel function. This paper provides a novel view on kernels based on fuzzy-logical concepts which allows to incorporate prior knowledge in the design process. It is demonstrated that kernels mapping to the unit interval with constant one in its diagonal can be represented by a commonly used fuzzy-logical formula for representing fuzzy rule bases. This means that a great class of kernels can be represented by fuzzy-logical concepts. Apart from this result, which only guarantees the existence of such a representation, constructive examples are presented and the relation to unlabeled learning is pointed out.

Learning to detect and classify malicious executables in the wild	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						data mining; concept learning; computer security; invasive software	CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS	We describe the use of machine learning and data mining to detect and classify malicious executables as they appear in the wild. We gathered 1; 971 benign and 1; 651 malicious executables and encoded each as a training example using n-grams of byte codes as features. Such processing resulted in more than 255 million distinct n-grams. After selecting the most relevant n-grams for prediction, we evaluated a variety of inductive methods, including naive Bayes, decision trees, support vector machines, and boosting. Ultimately, boosted decision trees outperformed other methods with an area under the ROC curve of 0.996. Results suggest that our methodology will scale to larger collections of executables. We also evaluated how well the methods classified executables based on the function of their payload, such as opening a backdoor and mass-mailing. Areas under the ROC curve for detecting payload function were in the neighborhood of 0.9, which were smaller than those for the detection task. However, we attribute this drop in performance to fewer training examples and to the challenge of obtaining properly labeled examples, rather than to a failing of the methodology or to some inherent difficulty of the classification task. Finally, we applied detectors to 291 malicious executables discovered after we gathered our original collection, and boosted decision trees achieved a true-positive rate of 0.98 for a desired false-positive rate of 0.05. This result is particularly important, for it suggests that our methodology could be used as the basis for an operational system for detecting previously undiscovered malicious executables.

To improve the prediction accuracy, support vector machine was used to predict the mechanical properties of hot-rolled plain carbon steel Q235B. Support vector machine is a novel machine learning method, which is a powerful tool used to solve the problem characterized by small sample, non-linearity, and high dimension with a good generalization performance. On the basis of the data collected from the supervisor of hot-rolling process, the support vector regression algorithm was used to build prediction models, and the off-line simulation indicates that predicted and measured results are in good agreement.

Successful teleoperation depends on how well images taken by the mobile robot are visualized to the user. To enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the visualization, an image retrieval system on such a robot's image database would be very useful. The main difference of the robot's image database from standard image databases is that various relevant images exist due to variety of viewing conditions. The main contribution of this paper is to propose an efficient retrieval approach, named location-driven approach, utilizing correlation between visual features and real world locations of images. Combining the location-driven approach with the conventional feature-driven approach, our goal can be viewed as finding an optimal classifier between relevant and irrelevant feature-location pairs. An active learning technique based on support vector machine is extended for this aim.

J	Klema, J; Almonayyes, A				Klema, Jiri; Almonayyes, Ahmad			Automatic categorization of fanatic text using random forests	KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; random forest; text classification		This paper presents a study of the task of classification and analysis of fanatic texts. The analyzed set of texts stems from an Arabic environment in Kuwait, where teachers and students were asked questions regarding various terrorist tendencies. The responses were assigned by a domain expert into one of three classes with respect to degree of fanaticism of their content. The main task was to grasp the implicit expert's knowledge and distinguish the documents according to their content. The paper deals with the bag-of-words representation of the documents. It applies learning algorithms that proved to work well in the field of text classification (TFIDF classifier, multinomial probabilistic model) as well as the random forest classifier that is well-known to cope with domains described by a large number of features. The associated task is to discover any knowledge helping to understand the domain. For this reason, the final models were also analyzed and used to reveal inherent structure inside the set of documents (a sub-class structure) or to identify important words and their possible relations.

We found that all these, including the simple string-matching-based k-nearest neighborhood used in a previous study, obtained higher accuracy rates than the MT systems currently available on the market. We also found that the support vector machine obtained the best accuracy rates (98.8%) of these methods. Finally, we analyzed errors against the machine-learning methods and commercially available MT systems and obtained error patterns that should be useful for making future improvements.

Identifying market segments in beef: Breed, slaughter weight and ageing time implications	MEAT SCIENCE			English	Article						consumers; preferences; clustering; acceptability; machine learning; artificial intelligence	DIFFERENT TEXTURE DEVICES; MEAT QUALITY; SENSORY CHARACTERISTICS; INTRAMUSCULAR FAT; CATTLE BREEDS; PALATABILITY; CARCASSES; TRAITS; ANGUS	In this paper we propose a method to learn the reasons why groups of consumers prefer some beef products to others. We emphasise the role of groups since, from a practical point of view, they may represent market segments that demand different products. Our method starts representing people's preferences in a metric space; there we are able to define a kernel based similarity function that allows a clustering algorithm to identify significant groups of consumers with homogeneous likes. Finally, in each cluster, we developed, with a support vector machine (SVM), a function that explains the preferences of those consumers grouped in the cluster. The method was applied to a real case of consumers of beef that tasted beef from seven Spanish breeds, slaughtered at two different weights and aged for three different ageing periods. Two different clusters of consumers were identified for acceptability and tenderness, but not for flavour. Those clusters ranked two very different breeds (Asturiana and Retinta) in opposite order. In acceptability, ageing period was appreciated in a different way. However, in tenderness most consumers preferred long ageing periods and heavier to lighter animals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Statistical strategies for avoiding false discoveries in metabolomics and related experiments	METABOLOMICS			English	Review						statistics; machine learning; false discovery; receiver-operator characteristic; hypothesis testing; statistical power; Bonferroni correction; bias; overfitting; cross validiation; credit assignment; visualisation	CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS; VARIABLE SELECTION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; MICROARRAY DATA; BREAST-CANCER; ROC CURVES	Many metabolomics, and other high-content or high-throughput, experiments are set up such that the primary aim is the discovery of biomarker metabolites that can discriminate, with a certain level of certainty, between nominally matched 'case' and 'control' samples. However, it is unfortunately very easy to find markers that are apparently persuasive but that are in fact entirely spurious, and there are well-known examples in the proteomics literature. The main types of danger are not entirely independent of each other, but include bias, inadequate sample size (especially relative to the number of metabolite variables and to the required statistical power to prove that a biomarker is discriminant), excessive false discovery rate due to multiple hypothesis testing, inappropriate choice of particular numerical methods, and overfitting (generally caused by the failure to perform adequate validation and cross-validation). Many studies fail to take these into account, and thereby fail to discover anything of true significance (despite their claims). We summarise these problems, and provide pointers to a substantial existing literature that should assist in the improved design and evaluation of metabolomics experiments, thereby allowing robust scientific conclusions to be drawn from the available data. We provide a list of some of the simpler checks that might improve one's confidence that a candidate biomarker is not simply a statistical artefact, and suggest a series of preferred tests and visualisation tools that can assist readers and authors in assessing papers. These tools can be applied to individual metabolites by using multiple univariate tests performed in parallel across all metabolite peaks. They may also be applied to the validation of multivariate models. We stress in particular that classical p-values such as "p < 0.05", that are often used in biomedicine, are far too optimistic when multiple tests are done simultaneously (as in metabolomics). Ultimately it is desirable that all data and metadata are available electronically, as this allows the entire community to assess conclusions drawn from them. These analyses apply to all high-dimensional 'omics' datasets.

We consider many different features computed on consecutive short portions of acoustic signal, among which those currently promoted in the literature on beat induction from acoustic signals and several original features, unmentioned in this literature. Evaluation of feature sets regarding their ability to provide reliable cues to the localization of beats is based on a machine learning methodology with a large corpus of beat-annotated music pieces, in audio format, covering distinctive music categories. Confirming common knowledge, energy is shown to be a very relevant cue to beat induction (especially the temporal variation of energy in various frequency bands, with the special relevance of frequency bands below 500 Hz and above 5 kHz). Some of the new features proposed in this paper are shown to outperform features currently promoted in the literature on beat induction from acoustic signals. We finally hypothesize that modeling beat induction may involve many different, complementary acoustic features and that the process of selecting relevant features should partly depend on acoustic properties of the very signal under consideration.

This paper describes a feature extraction method called semantic mapping. Semantic mapping, sparse random mapping and PCA are applied to self-organization of document collections using self-organizing map (SOM). The behaviors of the methods on projection of binary and tfidf document vector representations are compared. The classification error generated by SOM maps on text categorization of the K I collection was used to compare the performance of the methods. Semantic mapping generated better document representation than sparse random mapping. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the pre-defined instruction/operator sets, a flexible neural tree model can be created and evolved. This framework allows input variables selection, over-layer connections and different activation functions for the various nodes involved. The FNT structure is developed using genetic programming (GP) and the parameters are optimized by a memetic algorithm (MA). The proposed approach was applied for two real-world problems involving designing intrusion detection system (IDS) and for breast cancer classification. The IDS data has 41 inputs/features and the breast cancer classification problem has 30 inputs/features. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method is efficient for both input feature selection and improved classification rate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our aim was to investigate various data transformations that could be applied before training the SVM to retain task discriminatory variance while suppressing irrelevant components of variance. The data were acquired during a blocked experiment design: viewing unpleasant (Class 1), neutral (Class 2) and pleasant pictures (Class 3). In the multi-subject level analysis, we used a "leave-one-subject-out" approach, i.e. in each iteration, we trained the SVM using data from all but one subject and tested its performance in predicting the class label of the this last subject's data. In the single-subject level analysis, we used a "leave-one-block-out" approach, i.e. for each subject, we selected randomly one block per condition to be the test block and trained the SNM using data from the remaining blocks. Our results showed that in a single-subject level both temporal compression and space selection improved the SVM accuracy. However, in a multi-subject level, the temporal compression improved the performance of the SVM. but the space selection had no effect on the classification accuracy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Although in recent years progress in this field was made, the main drawback of the published prediction methods is a limited scope of comparison procedures, which in same cases were also improperly performed. Two examples include using protein datasets of varying homology, which has significant impact on the prediction accuracy, and comparing methods in pairs using different datasets. Based on extensive experimental work, the main aim of this paper is to revisit and reevaluate state of the art in this field. To this end, this paper performs a first-of-its-kind comprehensive and multi-goal study, which includes investigation of eight prediction algorithms, three protein sequence representations, three datasets with different homologies and finally three test procedures. Quality of several previously unused prediction algorithms, newly proposed sequence representation, and a new-to-the-field testing procedure is evaluated. Several important conclusions and findings are made. First, the logistic regression classifier, which was not previously used, is shown to perform better than other prediction algorithms, and high quality of previously used support vector machines is confirmed. The results also show that the proposed new sequence representation improves accuracy of the high quality prediction algorithms, while it does not improve results of the lower quality classifiers. The study shows that commonly used jackknife test is computationally expensive, and therefore computationally less demanding 10-fold cross-validation procedure is proposed. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference between these two procedures. The experiments show that sequence homology has very significant impact on the prediction accuracy, i.e. using highly homologous datasets results in higher accuracies. Thus, results of several past studies that use homologous datasets should not be perceived as reliable. The best achieved prediction accuracy for low homology datasets is about 57% and confirms results reported by Wang and Yuan [How good is the prediction of protein structural class by the component-coupled method?. Proteins 2000;38:165-175]. For a highly homologous dataset instance based classification is shown to be better than the previously reported results. It achieved 97% prediction accuracy demonstrating that homology is a major factor that can result in the overestimated prediction accuracy. (0 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.

There are a very large number of possible combinations of molecular descriptors and analysis methods that can be combined to pre-select compounds. The objectives strongly influence the methods chosen, in particular whether the desired outcome is to design a diverse library for initial screening; to follow up with additional similar hits (to perhaps help in establishing SAR) or to discover novel scaffolds (lead hopping) with the objective of obtaining novel patentable series (perhaps with different pharmacokinetics). Some of the factors that influence these decisions are discussed along with applications that compare and contrast methods and their performance in different situations.

This paper reviews the application of the approach to ligand-based virtual screening, where the sensors to be combined are functions that score molecules in a database on their likelihood of exhibiting some required biological activity. Much of the literature to date involves the combination of multiple similarity searches, although there is also an increasing interest in the combination of multiple machine-learning techniques. Both approaches are reviewed here, focusing on the extent to which fusion can improve the effectiveness of searching when compared with a single screening mechanism, and on the reasons that have been suggested for the observed performance enhancement.

J	Gola, J; Obrezanova, O; Champness, E; Segall, M				Gola, Joelle; Obrezanova, Olga; Champness, Ed; Segall, Matthew			ADMET property prediction: The state of the art and current challenges	QSAR & COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE			English	Review						ADMET; computational chemistry; drug design; structure-activity relationships	K+ CHANNEL BLOCKERS; IN-SILICO; ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY; VARIABLE SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; HERG BINDING; QSAR MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; ABSORPTION; PROGRESS	In this article, we review recent developments in the prediction of Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) properties by Quantitative Structure -Activity Relationships (QSAR). We consider advances in statistical modelling techniques, molecular descriptors and the sets of data used for model building and changes in the way in which predictive ADMET models are being applied in drug discovery. We also discuss the current challenges that remain to be addressed. While there has been progress in the adoption of non-linear modelling techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), the full advantages of these 'machine learning' techniques cannot be realised without further developments in molecular descriptors and availability of large, high-quality datasets. The largest pharmaceutical companies have developed large in-house databases containing consistently measured compound properties. However, these data are not yet available in the public domain and many models are still based on small 'historical' datasets taken from the literature. Probably, the largest remaining challenge is the full integration of predictive ADMET modelling in the drug discovery process. Until in silico models are applied to make effective decisions in a multi-parameter optimisation process, the full value they could bring will not be realised.

They will likely continue to be indispensable assets along with a growing library of software applications. This is primarily due to the increasingly massive amount of biology, chemistry and clinical data, which is now entering the public domain mainly as a result of NIH and commercially funded projects. We are therefore in need of new methods for mining this mountain of data in order to enable new hypothesis generation. The computational approaches include, but are not limited to, database compilation, quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR), pharmacophores, network visualization models, decision trees, machine learning algorithms and multidimensional data visualization software that could be used to improve drug delivery after mining public and/or proprietary data. We will discuss some areas of unmet needs in the area of data mining for drug delivery that can be addressed with new software tools or databases of relevance to future pharmaceutical projects.

J	Karwath, A; De Radet, L				Karwath, Andreas; De Radet, Luc			SMIREP: Predicting chemical activity from SMILES	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							AUTOMATED STRUCTURE EVALUATION; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR BINDING; BIODEGRADABILITY; MUTAGENICITY; ALGORITHMS; SYSTEM	Most approaches to structure-activity-relationship (SAR) prediction proceed in two steps. In the first step, a typically large set of fingerprints, or fragments of interest, is constructed (either by hand or by some recent data mining techniques). In the second step, machine learning techniques are applied to obtain a predictive model. The result is often not only a highly accurate but also hard to interpret model. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel SAR algorithm, SMIREP, which tightly integrates the fragment and model generation steps and which yields simple models in the form of a small set of IF-THEN rules. These rules contain SMILES fragments, which are easy to understand to the computational chemist. SMIREP combines ideas from the well-known IREP rule learner with a novel fragmentation algorithm for SMILES strings. SMIREP has been evaluated on three problems: the prediction of binding activities for the estrogen receptor (Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) National Center for Toxicological Research estrogen receptor (NCTRER) Database), the prediction of mutagenicity using the carcinogenic potency database (CPDB), and the prediction of biodegradability on a subset of the Environmental Fate Database (EFDB). In these applications, SMIREP has the advantage of producing easily interpretable rules while having predictive accuracies that are comparable to those of alternative state-of-the-art techniques.

J	Fukunishi, Y; Hojo, S; Nakamura, H				Fukunishi, Yoshifumi; Hojo, Shinichi; Nakamura, Haruki			An efficient in silico screening method based on the protein-compound affinity matrix and its application to the design of a focused library for cytochrome P450 (CYP) ligands	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							FLEXIBLE DOCKING; ATOMIC CHARGES; INHIBITORS; BINDING; FINGERPRINTS; SIMILARITIES; MOLECULES; IDENTIFICATION; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM	A new method has been developed to design a focused library based on available active compounds using protein-compound docking simulations. This method was applied to the design of a focused library for cytochrome P450 (CYP) ligands, not only to distinguish CYP ligands from other compounds but also to identify the putative ligands for a particular CYP. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the protein-compound affinity matrix, which was obtained by thorough docking calculations between a large set of protein pockets and chemical compounds. Each compound was depicted as a point in the PCA space. Compounds that were close to the known active compounds were selected as candidate hit compounds. A machine-learning technique optimized the docking scores of the protein-compound affinity matrix to maximize the database enrichment of the known active compounds, providing an optimized focused library.

J	Capriotti, E; Calabrese, R; Casadio, R				Capriotti, E.; Calabrese, R.; Casadio, R.			Predicting the insurgence of human genetic diseases associated to single point protein mutations with support vector machines and evolutionary information	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							NON-SYNONYMOUS SNPS; STABILITY CHANGES; DATABASE; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISMS; SEQUENCES; DIVERSITY; GENOMICS	Motivation: Human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent type of genetic variation in human population. One of the most important goals of SNP projects is to understand which human genotype variations are related to Mendelian and complex diseases. Great interest is focused on non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) that are responsible of protein single point mutation. nsSNPs can be neutral or disease associated. It is known that the mutation of only one residue in a protein sequence can be related to a number of pathological conditions of dramatic social impact such as Altzheimer's, Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's diseases. The quality and completeness of presently available SNPs databases allows the application of machine learning techniques to predict the insurgence of human diseases due to single point protein mutation starting from the protein sequence. Results: In this paper, we develop a method based on support vector machines (SVMs) that starting from the protein sequence information can predict whether a new phenotype derived from a nsSNP can be related to a genetic disease in humans. Using a dataset of 21185 single point mutations, 61% of which are disease-related, out of 3587 proteins, we show that our predictor can reach more than 74% accuracy in the specific task of predicting whether a single point mutation can be disease related or not. Our method, although based on less information, outperforms other web-available predictors implementing different approaches.

J	Lewis, DP; Jebara, T; Noble, WS				Lewis, Darrin P.; Jebara, Tony; Noble, William Stafford			Support vector machine learning from heterogeneous data: an empirical analysis using protein sequence and structure	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ALIGNMENT; KERNEL	Motivation: Drawing inferences from large, heterogeneous sets of biological data requires a theoretical framework that is capable of representing, e. g. DNA and protein sequences, protein structures, microarray expression data, various types of interaction networks, etc. Recently, a class of algorithms known as kernel methods has emerged as a powerful framework for combining diverse types of data. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is the most popular kernel method, due to its theoretical underpinnings and strong empirical performance on a wide variety of classification tasks. Furthermore, several recently described extensions allow the SVM to assign relative weights to various datasets, depending upon their utilities in performing a given classification task. Results: In this work, we empirically investigate the performance of the SVM on the task of inferring gene functional annotations from a combination of protein sequence and structure data. Our results suggest that the SVM is quite robust to noise in the input datasets. Consequently, in the presence of only two types of data, an SVM trained from an unweighted combination of datasets performs as well or better than a more sophisticated algorithm that assigns weights to individual data types. Indeed, for this simple case, we can demonstrate empirically that no solution is significantly better than the naive, unweighted average of the two datasets. On the other hand, when multiple noisy datasets are included in the experiment, then the naive approach fares worse than the weighted approach. Our results suggest that for many applications, a naive unweighted sum of kernels may be sufficient.

J	Eitrich, T; Lang, B				Eitrich, Tatjana; Lang, Bruno			Efficient optimization of support vector machine learning parameters for unbalanced datasets	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						support vector machine; parameter tuning; unbalanced datasets; derivative-free optimization	DECOMPOSITION METHOD; ALGORITHM	Support vector machines are powerful kernel methods for classification and regression tasks. If trained optimally, they produce excellent separating hyperplanes. The quality of the training, however, depends not only on the given training data but also on additional learning parameters, which are difficult to adjust, in particular for unbalanced datasets. Traditionally, grid search techniques have been used for determining suitable values for these parameters. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to adjusting the learning parameters using a derivative-free numerical optimizer. To make the optimization process more efficient, a new sensitive quality measure is introduced. Numerical tests with a well-known dataset show that our approach can produce support vector machines that are very well tuned to their classification tasks. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, descriptors explaining the nature of different protein-protein complexes are desirable. In this work, the authors introduced Epic Protein Interface Classification as a framework handling the preparation, processing, and analysis of protein-protein complexes for classification with machine learning algorithms. We applied four different machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines, C4.5 Decision Trees, K Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithm in combination with three feature selection methods, Filter (Relief F), Wrapper, and Genetic Algorithms, to extract discriminating features from the protein-protein complexes. To compare protein-protein complexes to each other, the authors represented the physicochemical characteristics of their interfaces in four different ways, using two different atomic contact vectors, DrugScore pair potential vectors and SFCscore descriptor vectors. We classified two different datasets: (A) 172 protein-protein complexes comprising 96 monomers, forming contacts enforced by the crystallographic packing environment (crystal contacts), and 76 biologically functional homodimer complexes; (B) 345 protein-protein complexes containing 147 permanent complexes and 198 transient complexes. We were able to classify up to 94.8% of the packing enforced/functional and up to 93.6% of the permanent/transient complexes correctly. Furthermore, we were able to extract relevant features from the different protein-protein complexes and introduce an approach for scoring the importance of the extracted features.

Genotypic predictors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						antiviral therapy; HIV; linear regression; machine learning	REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; IN-VITRO; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PROTEASE; SENSITIVITY; HYPERSUSCEPTIBILITY; REGRESSION; MUTATIONS; PHENOTYPE	Understanding the genetic basis of HIV-1 drug resistance is essential to developing new antiretroviral drugs and optimizing the use of existing drugs. This understanding, however, is hampered by the large numbers of mutation patterns associated with cross-resistance within each antiretroviral drug class. We used five statistical learning methods (decision trees, neural networks, support vector regression, least-squares regression, and least angle regression) to relate HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase mutations to in vitro susceptibility to 16 antiretroviral drugs. Learning methods were trained and tested on a public data set of genotype-phenotype correlations by 5-fold cross-validation. For each learning method, four mutation sets were used as input features: a complete set of all mutations in >= 2 sequences in the data set, the 30 most common data set mutations, an expert panel mutation set, and a set of nonpolymorphic treatment-selected mutations from a public database linking protease and reverse transcriptase sequences to antiretroviral drug exposure. The nonpolymorphic treatment-selected mutations led to the best predictions: 80.1% accuracy at classifying sequences as susceptible, low/intermediate resistant, or highly resistant. Least angle regression predicted susceptibility significantly better than other methods when using the complete set of mutations. The three regression methods provided consistent estimates of the quantitative effect of mutations on drug susceptibility, identifying nearly all previously reported genotype-phenotype associations an providing strong statistical support for many new associations. Mutation regression coefficients showed that, within a drug class, cross-resistance patterns differ for different mutation subsets and that cross-resistance has been underestimated.

Automated recognition of malignancy mentions in biomedical literature	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							NAME RECOGNITION; LANGUAGE SYSTEM; GENE; TEXT; FEATURES; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; EXTRACTION; TAGGER	Background: The rapid proliferation of biomedical text makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to identify, synthesize, and utilize developed knowledge in their fields of interest. Automated information extraction procedures can assist in the acquisition and management of this knowledge. Previous efforts in biomedical text mining have focused primarily upon named entity recognition of well-defined molecular objects such as genes, but less work has been performed to identify disease-related objects and concepts. Furthermore, promise has been tempered by an inability to efficiently scale approaches in ways that minimize manual efforts and still perform with high accuracy. Here, we have applied a machine-learning approach previously successful for identifying molecular entities to a disease concept to determine if the underlying probabilistic model effectively generalizes to unrelated concepts with minimal manual intervention for model retraining. Results: We developed a named entity recognizer (MTag), an entity tagger for recognizing clinical descriptions of malignancy presented in text. The application uses the machine-learning technique Conditional Random Fields with additional domain-specific features. MTag was tested with 1,010 training and 432 evaluation documents pertaining to cancer genomics. Overall, our experiments resulted in 0.85 precision, 0.83 recall, and 0.84 F-measure on the evaluation set. Compared with a baseline system using string matching of text with a neoplasm term list, MTag performed with a much higher recall rate (92.1% vs. 42.1% recall) and demonstrated the ability to learn new patterns. Application of MTag to all MEDLINE abstracts yielded the identification of 580,002 unique and 9,153,340 overall mentions of malignancy. Significantly, addition of an extensive lexicon of malignancy mentions as a feature set for extraction had minimal impact in performance. Conclusion: Together, these results suggest that the identification of disparate biomedical entity classes in free text may be achievable with high accuracy and only moderate additional effort for each new application domain.

Machine learning techniques in disease forecasting: a case study on rice blast prediction	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REGRESSION NEURAL-NETWORK; GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; COLLETOTRICHUM-GLOEOSPORIOIDES; INFECTION PERIODS; AMINO-ACID; TAN SPOT; PROTEIN; WEATHER	Background: Diverse modeling approaches viz. neural networks and multiple regression have been followed to date for disease prediction in plant populations. However, due to their inability to predict value of unknown data points and longer training times, there is need for exploiting new prediction softwares for better understanding of plant-pathogen-environment relationships. Further, there is no online tool available which can help the plant researchers or farmers in timely application of control measures. This paper introduces a new prediction approach based on support vector machines for developing weather-based prediction models of plant diseases. Results: Six significant weather variables were selected as predictor variables. Two series of models (cross-location and cross-year) were developed and validated using a five-fold cross validation procedure. For cross-year models, the conventional multiple regression (REG) approach achieved an average correlation coefficient (r) of 0.50, which increased to 0.60 and percent mean absolute error (% MAE) decreased from 65.42 to 52.24 when back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was used. With generalized regression neural network (GRNN), the r increased to 0.70 and % MAE also improved to 46.30, which further increased to r = 0.77 and % MAE = 36.66 when support vector machine (SVM) based method was used. Similarly, cross-location validation achieved r = 0.48, 0.56 and 0.66 using REG, BPNN and GRNN respectively, with their corresponding % MAE as 77.54, 66.11 and 58.26. The SVM-based method outperformed all the three approaches by further increasing r to 0.74 with improvement in % MAE to 44.12. Overall, this SVM-based prediction approach will open new vistas in the area of forecasting plant diseases of various crops. Conclusion: Our case study demonstrated that SVM is better than existing machine learning techniques and conventional REG approaches in forecasting plant diseases. In this direction, we have also developed a SVM-based web server for rice blast prediction, a first of its kind worldwide, which can help the plant science community and farmers in their decision making process.

The results are relevant to research on efficient Bayesian network inference, such as computing a most probable explanation or belief updating, since they allow controlled experimentation to determine the impact of improvements to inference algorithms. The results are also relevant to research on machine learning of Bayesian networks, since they support controlled generation of a large number of data sets at a given difficulty level. Our generation algorithms, called BPART and MPART, support controlled but random construction of bipartite and multipartite Bayesian networks. The Bayesian network parameters that we vary are the total number of nodes, degree of connectivity, the ratio of the number of non-root nodes to the number of root nodes, regularity of the underlying graph, and characteristics of the conditional probability tables. The main dependent parameter is the size of the maximal clique as generated by tree clustering. This article presents extensive empirical analysis using the HUGIN tree clustering approach as well as theoretical analysis related to the random generation of Bayesian networks using BPART and MPART.

Learning adaptation knowledge to improve case-based reasoning	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						case-based reasoning; adaptation knowledge; knowledge acquisition; machine learning; introspective learning	RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM; DESIGN	Case-Based Reasoning systems retrieve and reuse solutions for previously solved problems that have been encountered and remembered as cases. In some domains, particularly where the problem solving is a classification task, the retrieved solution can be reused directly. But for design tasks it is common for the retrieved solution to be regarded as an initial solution that should be refined to reflect the differences between the new and retrieved problems. The acquisition of adaptation knowledge to achieve this refinement can be demanding, despite the fact that the knowledge source of stored cases captures a substantial part of the problem-solving expertise. This paper describes an introspective learning approach where the case knowledge itself provides a source from which training data for the adaptation task can be assembled. Different learning algorithms are explored and the effect of the learned adaptations is demonstrated for a demanding component-based pharmaceutical design task, tablet formulation. The evaluation highlights the incremental nature of adaptation as a further reasoning step after nearest-neighbour retrieval. A new property-based classification to adapt symbolic values is proposed, and an ensemble of these property-based adaptation classifiers has been particularly successful for the most difficult of the symbolic adaptation tasks in tablet formulation.

Some require immediate treatment while others, with only minor disorders, may be sent home. Detecting ACS patients using a machine learning approach would be advantageous in many situations. Methods and materials: Artificial neural network (ANN) ensembles and logistic regression models were trained on data from 634 patients presenting an emergency department with chest pain. Only data immediately available at patient presentation were used, including electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The models were analyzed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, calibration assessments, inter- and intra-method variations. Effective odds ratios for the ANN ensembles were compared with the odds ratios obtained from the logistic model. Results: The ANN ensemble approach together with ECG data preprocessed using principal component analysis resulted in an area under the ROC curve of 80%. At the sensitivity of 95% the specificity was 41%, corresponding to a negative predictive value of 97%, given the ACS prevalence of 21%. Adding clinical data available at presentation did not improve the ANN ensemble performance. Using the area under the ROC curve and model calibration as measures of performance we found an advantage using the ANN ensemble models compared to the logistic regression models. Conclusion: Clinically, a prediction model of the present type, combined with the judgment of trained emergency department personnel, could be useful for the early discharge of chest pain patients in populations with a tow prevalence of ACS.

Thus, a large number of techniques have been developed based on Artificial Intelligence (Logic-based techniques, Perceptron-based techniques) and Statistics (Bayesian Networks, Instance-based techniques). The goal of supervised learning is to build a concise model of the distribution of class labels in terms of predictor features. The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown. This paper describes various classification algorithms and the recent attempt for improving classification accuracy-ensembles of classifiers.	[Kotsiantis, S. B.; Pintelas, P.

Gerard			The Simplicity and Power model for inductive inference	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						simplicity; cognitive science; categorization; learning	OPTIMAL DATA SELECTION; SIMILARITY; CATEGORIZATION; INFORMATION; PRINCIPLE; CLASSIFICATION; COMPRESSION; ACQUISITION; COMPLEXITY; KNOWLEDGE	With this paper we wish to present a simplicity (informally 'simple explanations are the best') formalism that is easily and directly applicable to modeling problems in cognitive science. While simplicity has been extensively advocated as a psychologically relevant principle, a general modeling formalism has been lacking. The Simplicity and Power model (SP) is a particular simplicity-based framework, that has been supported in machine learning (Wolff, Unifying computing and cognition: the SP theory and its applications, 2006). We propose its utility in cognitive modeling. For illustration, we provide SP demonstrations of the trade-off between encoding with whole exemplars versus parts of stimuli in learning and the effect of wide versus narrow distributions in categorization. In both cases, SP computations show how simplicity can account for these contrasts, in terms of how the frequency of individual exemplars in training compares to the frequency of their constituent parts.

PSoL: a positive sample only learning algorithm for finding non-coding RNA genes	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ANTISENSE RNA; BACTERIA; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; GENOME	Motivation: Small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes play important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes. However, detection of ncRNA genes is a great challenge to both experimental and computational approaches. In this study, we describe a new approach called positive sample only learning (PSoL) to predict ncRNA genes in the Escherichia coli genome. Although PSoL is a machine learning method for classification, it requires no negative training data, which, in general, is hard to define properly and affects the performance of machine learning dramatically. In addition, using the support vector machine (SVM) as the core learning algorithm, PSoL can integrate many different kinds of information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Besides the application of PSoL for predicting ncRNAs, PSoL is applicable to many other bioinformatics problems as well. Results: The PSoL method is assessed by 5-fold cross-validation experiments which show that PSoL can achieve about 80% accuracy in recovery of known ncRNAs.

J	Budagyan, L; Abagyan, R				Budagyan, Levon; Abagyan, Ruben			Weighted quality estimates in machine learning	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SEQUENCE WEIGHTS; PREDICTION; PROTEINS	Motivation: Machine learning methods such as neural networks, support vector machines, and other classification and regression methods rely on iterative optimization of the model quality in the space of the parameters of the method. Model quality measures (accuracies, correlations, etc.) are frequently overly optimistic because the training sets are dominated by particular families and subfamilies. To overcome the bias, the dataset is usually reduced by filtering out closely related objects. However, such filtering uses fixed similarity thresholds and ignores a part of the training information. Results: We suggested a novel approach to calculate prediction model quality based on assigning to each data point inverse density weights derived from the postulated distance metric. We demonstrated that our new weighted measures estimate the model generalization better and are consistent with the machine learning theory. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis theorem was reformulated and applied to derive the space-uniform error estimates. Two examples were used to illustrate the advantages of the inverse density weighting. First, we demonstrated on a set with a built-in bias that the unweighted cross-validation procedure leads to an overly optimistic quality estimate, while the density-weighted quality estimates are more realistic. Second, an analytical equation for weighted quality estimates was used to derive an SVM model for signal peptide prediction using a full set of known signal peptides, instead of the usual filtered subset.

J	Androulakis, IP				Androulakis, Ioannis P.			New approaches for representing, analyzing and visualizing complex kinetic transformations	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						complex kinetic mechanisms; combustion; visualization	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; COMBUSTION; SIMULATION; IGNITION; ENGINE; MODEL	Complex kinetic mechanisms involving thousands of reacting species and tens of thousands of reactions are currently required for the rational analysis of modem combustion systems. In order to represent, analyze and visualize effectively the ignition process, advanced computational techniques will be required. Recently, we introduced a novel approach that captured the principal elemental transformations in complex reaction mechanisms in the form of graphs. In this work, we propose new approaches in order to arrive at a compact representation of the information content of these graphs utilizing machine learning principles, such as feature selection in time series and hashing. These approaches allow the projection of the totality of the information contained in the graphs describing the chemical transformations onto a single scalar. The temporally evolving graphs are treated as streaming data and locality-preserving hashing allows the unique assignment of a scalar "motif" value to each such graph. Analysis of those motifs allows the quick identification of "clusters" of identical reaction graphs that correspond to regimes with similar kinetic characteristics. The approach is illustrated with highly complex kinetic mechanisms describing pentane autoignition. It is demonstrated how this novel representation allows the identification of regions where similar temporal history of the chemical transformations is experienced. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Location awareness through trajectory prediction	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Geoinformatics Geospatial Information Research (Geoinformatics 2004)	JUN 07-09, 2004	Gavel, SWEDEN		Univ Gavel	location-aware computing; location management; user movement; trajectory prediction; probabilistic methods; machine learning algorithms	MOBILE	Location-aware computing is a type of ubiquitous computing that uses user's location information as an essential parameter for providing services and application-related optimization. Location management plays an important role in location-aware computing because the provision of services requires convenient access to dynamic location and location-dependent information. Many existing location management strategies are passive since they rely on system capability to periodically record current location information. In contrast, active strategies predict user movement through trajectories and locations. Trajectory prediction provides richer location and context information and facilitates the means for adapting to future locations. In this paper, we present two models for trajectory prediction, namely probability-based model and learning-based model. We analyze these two models and conduct experiments to test their performances in location-aware systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A 3D object classifier for discriminating manufacturing processes	COMPUTERS & GRAPHICS-UK			English	Article						3D search; shape recognition; shape matching; solid model databases	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DESIGN; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	Automated classification of artifacts produced by mechanical computer-aided design (CAD) is a unique research frontier for 3D matching and mesh processing. Unlike general graphical models, mechanical CAD artifacts have a physical realization via a variety of manufacturing processes as well as functional and behavioral attributes. The general problem of how to best correlate low-level shape data with the higher-order manufacturing and mechanical properties remains an open area of research with many practical applications (cost estimation, design archival, variational design and process selection). This paper addresses the problem of manufacturing process discrimination, i.e., determination of the best (or most likely) manufacturing process from shape feature information. Specifically, we introduce a new curvature-based shape descriptor and show its applicability to manufacturing process discrimination using a publicly available set of artifacts from the National Design Repository. Statistics on surface curvatures are used to construct the curvature-based shape descriptor; and a supervised machine learning classifier, based on support vector machines, is applied to learn a separator for models that are "prismatic machined" and "cast-then-machined". The authors believe that this work can be the basis for practical new techniques for manufacturing cost estimation, engineering analysis and design archival. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Janssens, D; Brijs, T; Vanhoof, K; Wets, G				Janssens, D; Brijs, T; Vanhoof, K; Wets, G			Evaluating the performance of cost-based discretization versus entropy- and error-based discretization	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						discretization; ROC-curve; cost-sensitive learning	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; ROC CURVE; ATTRIBUTES; AREA	Discretization is defined as the process that divides continuous numeric values into intervals of discrete categorical values. In this article, the concept of cost-based discretization as a pre-processing step to the induction of a classifier is introduced in order to obtain an optimal multi-interval splitting for each numeric attribute. A transparent description of the method and the steps involved in cost-based discretization are given. The aim of this paper is to present this method and to assess the potential benefits of such an approach. Furthermore, its performance against two other well-known methods, i.e. entropy- and pure error-based discretization is examined. To this end, experiments on 14 data sets, taken from the UCI Repository on Machine Learning were carried out. In order to compare the different methods, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graph was used and tested on its level of significance. For most data sets the results show that cost-based discretization achieves satisfactory results when compared to entropy- and error-based discretization. Given its importance, many researchers have already contributed to the issue of discretization in the past. However, to the best of our knowledge, no efforts have been made yet to include the concept of misclassification costs to find an optimal multi-split for discretization purposes, prior to induction of the decision tree. For this reason, this new concept is introduced and explored in this article by means of operations research techniques. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We examine the problems spam. introduces, what spam is and how we can measure it. The paper primarily focuses on automated, non-interactive filters, with a broad review ranging from commercial implementations to ideas confined to current research papers. Both machine learning- and non-machine learning-based filters are reviewed as potential solutions and a taxonomy of known approaches is presented. While a range of different techniques have and continue to be evaluated in academic research, heuristic and Bayesian filtering dominate commercial filtering systems; therefore, a case study of these techniques is presented to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of these popular techniques.

The proposed method is based on a hybrid method that uses feature selection (FS) and artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) with fuzzy resource allocation mechanism. AIRS has showed an effective performance on several problems such as machine learning benchmark problems and medical classification problems like breast cancer, diabets, liver disorders classification. By hybridizing FS and AIRS with fuzzy resource allocation mechanism, a method is obtained to solve this diagnosis problem via classifying. The robustness of this method with regard to sampling variations is examined using a cross-validation method. We used hepatitis disease dataset which is taken from UCI machine learning repository. We obtained a classification accuracy of 92.59%, which is the highest one reached so far. The classification accuracy was obtained via 10-fold cross validation. The obtained classification accuracy of our system was 92.59% and it was very promising with regard to the other classification applications in literature for this problem. Also, sensitivity, and specificity values for hepatitis disease dataset were obtained as 100 and 85%. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The primary role of the thyroid gland is to help regulation of the body's metabolism. Thyroid hormone produced by thyroid gland provides this. Production of too little thyroid hormone (hypo-thyroidism) or production of too much thyroid hormone (hyper-thyroidism) defines the types of thyroid disease. It is evident that usage of machine learning methods in disease diagnosis has been increasing gradually. In this study, diagnosis of thyroid disease, which is a very common and important disease, was conducted with such a machine learning system. In this study, we have detected on thyroid disease using principles component analysis (PCA), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) based weighted pre-processing and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The proposed system has three stages. In the first stage, dimension of thyroid disease dataset that has 5 features is reduced to 2 features using principles component analysis. In the second stage, a new weighting scheme based on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method was utilized as a pre-processing step before the main classifier. Then, in the third stage, we have used adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to diagnosis of thyroid disease. We took the thyroid disease dataset used in our study from the UCI machine learning database. The obtained classification accuracy of our system was 100% and it was very promising with regard to the other classification applications in literature for this problem. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Visualising and assessing the probable error from downscaling ecological time series data	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Informatics	OCT 24-28, 2004	Busan, SOUTH KOREA	Int Soc Ecol Informat		univariate time series; interpolation; downscaling; multi-scale		Collecting natural data at regular, fine scales is an onerous and often costly procedure. However, there is a basic need for fine scale data when applying inductive methods such as neural networks or genetic algorithms for the development of ecological models. This paper will address the issues involved in interpolating data for use in machine learning methods by considering how to determine if a downscaling of the data is valid. The approach is based on a multi-scale estimate of errors. The resulting function has similar properties to a time series variogram; however, the comparison at different scales is based on the variance introduced by rescaling from the original sequence. This approach has a number of properties, including the ability to detect frequencies in the data below the current sampling rate, an estimate of the probable average error introduced when a sampled variable is downscaled and a method for visualising the sequences of a time series that are most susceptible to error due to sampling. The described approach is ideal for supporting the ongoing sampling of ecological data and as a tool for assessing the impact of using interpolated data for building inductive models of ecological response.

Informatics software for the ecologist's toolbox: A basic example	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Informatics	OCT 24-28, 2004	Busan, SOUTH KOREA	Int Soc Ecol Informat		artificial neural networks; genetic algorithms; classification trees; software; fish IBI	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; INDEX	Machine learning techniques for ecological applications or "eco-informatics" are becoming increasingly useful and accessible as software for these techniques becomes more readily available. Complex ecological data sets with a multitude of variables are also increasingly available. Ecologists, who do not necessarily have extensive backgrounds in machine-learning techniques, are facing decisions on new methods of data analysis. We evaluated the predictive ability of three commercially available (i.e. user-friendly) software packages for artificial neural networks (ANNs), evolutionary algorithms (EAs), and classificatiordregression trees (CART). To demonstrate their usage, we analyzed fish and habitat data from the mid-Atlantic region of the US, which was collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These data, including over 200 environmental descriptors summarizing watershed, stream, and water chemistry, and physical habitat characteristics in addition to fish community metrics (i.e. richness, Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores, % exotics), were collected as part of the EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Protection program. We predicted fish IBI scores as a function of these local and regional scale habitat variables. Predictive ability is evaluated with independent validation data. These approaches could prove especially useful for conservation or management applications where ecologists seek to utilize the most comprehensive data to make predictions at various scales. By employing "user-friendly" software we hope to show that ecologists, without extensive knowledge of computational science, can benefit from these techniques by extracting more information about complex ecosystems. We found that all models predicted better than chance (p < 0.05). Relative strengths and weaknesses of these three approaches are compared and recommendations for their use in ecological applications are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Customs authorities and international traders need a HS code query tool to make their processing efficient and automatic. Since HS codes are identified at 5-7 levels of classification, then any intelligent coding service will need to combine a knowledge database, with the techniques of data mining, machine learning and semantics reasoning. In this paper, the authors propose a comprehensive solution for such a coding service. The architecture, related techniques, technical solution and implementation considerations for the proposed system have been provided. Several of the proposed functions and implementation techniques have been developed and deployed by the Shanghai International Airport Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau. The coding service has been published as a Web service, and has the potential to be widely used by authorities and international traders around the world. The proposed system may also be appropriate for other applications that relate to code or classification processes, such as RFID-based or product ontology based applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Machine learning methods for transcription data integration	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							FACTOR-BINDING SITES; CIS-REGULATORY MODULES; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; GENE-EXPRESSION; GENOME SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; DISCOVERY; NETWORKS; DNA; CLASSIFICATION	Gene expression is modulated by transcription factors (TFs), which are proteins that generally hind to DNA adjacent to coding regions and initiate transcription. Each target gene can be regulated by more than one TF, and each TF can regulate many targets. For a complete molecular understanding of transcriptional regulation, researchers must first associate each TF with the set of genes that it regulates. Here we present a summary of completed work on the ability to associate 104 TFs with their binding sites using support vector machines (SVMs), which are classfication algorithms based in statistical learning theory. We use several types of genomic datasets to train classifiers in order to predict TF binding in the yeast genome. We consider motif matches, subsequence counts, motif conservation, functional annotation, and expression profiles. A simple weighting scheme varies the contribution of each type of genomic data when building a final SVM classifier, which we evaluate using known binding sites published in the literature and in online databases. The SVM algorithm works best when all datasets are combined, producing 73% coverage of known interactions, with a prediction accuracy of almost 0.9. We discuss new ideas and preliminary work for improving SVM classification of biological data.

Machine learning methods are used to design the models, including Gaussian mixture models, support vector machines, and random forest classifiers. Estimates of the subjective mean opinion score (MOS) generated by the models are combined using hard or soft decisions generated by a classifier which has learned to match the input signal with the models. Test results show the algorithm outperforming ITU-T P.563, the current "state-of-art" standard single-ended algorithm.

For complexity reasons, most stimuli generators use sequential solutions without planning ahead. Therefore, in many cases, they fail to produce a consistent stimuli due to an inadequate selection of the initial state. We propose a new method, based on machine learning techniques, to improve generation success by learning the relationship between the initial state vector and generation success. We applied the proposed method in two different settings, with the objective of improving generation success and coverage in processor and system level generation. In both settings, the proposed method significantly reduced generation failures and enabled faster coverage.

The method is based on recent developments in statistical learning theory concerning transductive inference and in particular transductive SVMs (TSVMs). TSVMs exploit specific iterative algorithms which gradually search a reliable separating hyperplane (in the kernel space) with a transductive process that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled samples in the training phase. Based on an analysis of the properties of the TSVMs presented in the literature, a novel modified TSVM classifier designed for addressing ill-posed remote-sensing problems is proposed. In particular, the proposed technique: 1) is based on a novel transductive procedure that exploits a weighting strategy for unlabeled. patterns, based on a time-dependent criterion; 2) is able to mitigate the effects of suboptimal model selection (which is unavoidable in the presence of small-size training sets); and 3) can address multiclass, cases. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on a set of ill-posed remote-sensing classification problems representing different operative conditions.

Prediction of continental-scale evapotranspiration by combining MODIS and AmeriFlux data through support vector machine	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						AmeriFlux; evapotranspiration (ET); Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); support vector machines (SVMs)	LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; VEGETATION INDEXES; VALIDATION; FLUX; SATELLITE; PARAMETERS; ECOSYSTEM; PATTERN; NDVI	Application of remote sensing data to extrapolate evapotranspiration (ET) measured at eddy covariance flux towers is a potentially powerful method to estimate continental-scale ET. In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and an inductive machine learning technique called support vector machine (SVM) to develop a predictive ET model. The model was then applied to the conterminous U.S. In this process, we first trained the SVM to predict 2000-2002 ET measurements from 25 AmeriFlux sites using three remotely sensed variables [land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover] and one ground-measured variable (surface shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated the model performance by predicting ET for 19 flux sites in 2003. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted ET with a root-mean-square error (rmse) of 0.62 mm/day (approximately 23% of the mean observed values) and an R-2 of 0.75. The rmse from SVM was significantly smaller than that from neural network and multiple-regression approaches in a cross-validation experiment. Among the explanatory variables, EVI was the most important factor. Indeed, removing this variable induced an rmse increase from 0.54 to 0.77 mm/day. Third, with forcings; from remote sensing data alone, we used the SVM model to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of ET for the conterminous U.S. for 2004. The SVM model captured the spatial and temporal variations of ET at a continental scale.

However, the performance of SVM-based RF approaches is often poor when the number of labeled feedback samples is small. This is mainly due to 1) the SVM classifier being unstable for small-size training sets because its optimal hyper plane is too sensitive to the training examples; and 2) the kernel method being ineffective because the feature dimension is much greater than the size of the training samples. In this paper, we develop a new machine learning technique, multitraining SVM (MTSVM), which combines the merits of the cotraining technique and a random sampling method in the feature space. Based on the proposed MTSVM algorithm, the above two problems can be mitigated. Experiments are carried out on a large image set of some 20 000 images, and the preliminary results demonstrate that the developed method consistently improves the performance over conventional SVM-based RFs in terms of precision and standard deviation, which are used to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of a RF algorithm, respectively.

However, many irrelevant links can be found in real-world link data such as Web pages. Often, these noisy and irrelevant links do not provide useful and predictive information for categorization. It is thus important to automatically identify which links are most relevant for categorization. In this paper, we present a contextual dependency network (CDN) model for classifying linked objects in the presence of noisy and irrelevant links. The CDN model makes use of a dependency function that characterizes the contextual dependencies among linked objects. In this way, CDNs can differentiate the impacts of the related objects on the classification and consequently reduce the effect of irrelevant links on the classification. We show how to learn the CDN model effectively and how to use the Gibbs inference framework over the learned model for collective classification of multiple linked objects. The experiments show that the CDN model demonstrates relatively high robustness on data sets containing irrelevant links.

Data fusion and multicue data matching by diffusion maps	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						pattern matching; graph theory; graph algorithms; Markov processes; machine learning; data mining; image databases	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; GEOMETRIC DIFFUSIONS; STRUCTURE DEFINITION; HARMONIC-ANALYSIS; TOOL; EIGENMAPS	Data fusion and multicue data matching are fundamental tasks of high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we apply the recently introduced diffusion framework to address these tasks. Our contribution is three-fold: First, we present the Laplace-Beltrami approach for computing density invariant embeddings which are essential for integrating different sources of data. Second, we describe a refinement of the Nystrom extension algorithm called "geometric harmonics." We also explain how to use this tool for data assimilation. Finally, we introduce a multicue data matching scheme based on nonlinear spectral graphs alignment. The effectiveness of the presented schemes is validated by applying it to the problems of lipreading and image sequence alignment.

The objective of this paper is to develop adaptive controlled islanding as a component of an emergency power system control strategy. There are two primary aspects of controlled islanding: 1) where to island and 2) when to island? Assisted by a decision tree (DT) approach, this paper seeks to address the "when to island" aspect. A decision tree based tool is proposed to recognize conditions existing in the system that warrant controlled islanding. A 29-generator, 179-bus system is employed to demonstrate the tool. Simulation data are used to train DTs, and the online performance of DTs is then evaluated as part of a controlled islanding strategy.

Some of the difficulties that user modeling faces are the amount of data available to create user models, the adequacy of the data, the noise within that data, and the necessity of capturing the imprecise nature of human behavior. Data mining and machine learning techniques have the ability to handle large amounts of data and to process uncertainty. These characteristics make these techniques suitable for automatic generation of user models that simulate human decision making. This,paper surveys different data mining techniques that can be used to efficiently and accurately capture user behavior. The paper also presents guidelines that show which techniques may be used more efficiently according to the task implemented by the application.

J	Mansmann, F; Vinnik, S				Mansmann, Florian; Vinnik, Svetlana			Interactive exploration of data traffic with hierarchical network maps	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						data and knowledge visualization; information visualization; visual analytics; network security		Network communication has become indispensable in business, education, and government. With the pervasive role of the Internet as a means of sharing information across networks, its misuse for destructive purposes, such as spreading malicious code, compromising remote hosts, or damaging data through unauthorized access, has grown immensely in the recent years. The classical way of monitoring the operation of large network systems is by analyzing the system logs for detecting anomalies. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Network Map, an interactive visualization technique for gaining a deeper insight into network flow behavior by means of user-driven visual exploration. Our approach is meant as an enhancement to conventional analysis methods based on statistics or machine learning. We use multidimensional modeling combined with position and display awareness to view source and target data of the hosts in a hierarchical fashion with the ability to interactively change the level of aggregation or apply filtering.

J	Wei, X; Croft, B; McCallum, A				Wei, Xing; Croft, Bruce; McCallum, Andrew			Table extraction for answer retrieval	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						table extraction; conditional random fields; question answering; information extraction		The ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary component of many information retrieval tasks. Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information. Tables do this by employing layout patterns to efficiently indicate fields and records in two-dimensional form. Their rich combination of formatting and content presents difficulties for traditional retrieval techniques. This paper describes techniques for extracting tables from text and retrieving answers from the extracted information. We compare machine learning (especially, Conditional Random Fields) and heuristic methods for table extraction. To retrieve answers, our approach creates a cell document, which contains the cell and its metadata (headers, titles) for each table cell, and the retrieval model ranks the cells of the extracted tables using a language-modeling approach. Performance is tested using government statistical Web sites and news articles, and errors are analyzed in order to improve the system.

J	Shuai, DX; Xue, FL				Shuai, Dianxun; Xue Fangliang			Generalized particle model used for data clustering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data clustering; kernel method; multidimensional data; generalized particle model; local transitive rule; stochastic process; Markov chain	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	Data clustering has been widely used in many areas, such as data mining, statistics, machine learning and so on.(a) A variety of clustering approaches have been proposed so far, but most of them are not qualified to quickly cluster a large-scale high-dimensional database. This paper is devoted to a novel data clustering approach based on a generalized particle model (GPM). The GPM transforms the data clustering process into a stochastic process over the configuration space on a GPM array. The proposed approach is characterized by the self-organizing clustering and many advantages in terms of the insensitivity to noise, quality robustness to clustered data, suitability for high-dimensional and massive data sets, learning ability, openness and easier hardware implementation with the VLSI systolic technology. The analysis and simulations have shown the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed GPM approach to data clustering.

Using data continualization and expansion to improve small data set learning accuracy for early flexible manufacturing system (FMS) scheduling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						small data set; scheduling; flexible manufacturing system; machine learning	KNOWLEDGE; ENVIRONMENTS; INFORMATION; SIMULATION; NETWORK	Knowledge derived from limited data gathered in the early manufacturing stages is usually too fragile for a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). Unfortunately, production decisions have to be made quickly in a competitive environment. In a previous study, a strategy using continuous data and domain external expansion methods under a known data domain range was proposed to solve the so-called small data set learning problem in FMS. The present paper goes further in seeking a quantitative method to determine the range of domain external expansion under unknown domain bounds. The research considers the data bias phenomenon that often occurs in small data sets and provides a method for its adjustment. Beyond this, the study also compares the learning results among three types of membership functions (Bell, Trapezoid, Triangular) for data fuzzification. The results show that the proposed approach can advance the learning accuracy of a broad range of applications.

J	Lee, TH; Yang, Y				Lee, Tae-Hwy; Yang, Yang			Bagging binary and quantile predictors for time series	JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS			English	Article						asymmetric cost function; bagging; binary prediction; BMA; forecast combination; majority voting; quantile prediction; time series	REGRESSION; ERROR; MODEL; COMBINATION; FORECASTS; ACCURACY	Bootstrap aggregating or Bagging, introduced by Breiman (1996a. Bagging predictors. Machine Learning 24, 123-140), has been proved to be effective to improve on unstable forecast. Theoretical and empirical works using classification, regression trees, variable selection in linear and non-linear regression have shown that bagging can generate substantial prediction gain. However, most of the existing literature on bagging has been limited to the cross sectional circumstances with symmetric cost functions. In this paper, we extend the application of bagging to time series settings with asymmetric cost functions, particularly for predicting signs and quantiles. We use quantile predictions to construct a binary predictor and the majority-voted bagging binary prediction. We show that bagging may improve the binary prediction in small sample, but it does not improve in large sample. Various bagging forecast combination weights are used such as equal weighted and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) weighted combinations. For demonstration, we present results from Monte Carlo experiments and from empirical applications using monthly S&P500 and NASDAQ stock index returns. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Weon, IY; Song, DH; Lee, CH				Weon, Ill-Young; Song, Doo Heon; Lee, Chang-Hoon			Effective intrusion detection model through the combination of a signature-based intrusion detection system and a machine learning-based intrusion detection system	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						network intrusion detection system; machine learning; combined model; false alarm; detection of new attack; instance-based learner		In the field of network intrusion detection, both the signature-based intrusion detection system and the machine learning-based intrusion detection system possess advantages and disadvantages. When the two discrepant systems are combined in a way that the former is used as the main system and the latter as a supporting system, the machine learning-based intrusion detection system measures the validity of alarms determined by the signature-based intrusion detection system and filters out any false alarms. What is more, such an approach can also detect attacks that the signature-based system by itself cannot detect. The objective of this paper is to propose a combined model of the signature-based and machine learning-based intrusion detection systems and to show that the combined system is more efficient than each individual system. We used the DARPA Data Set in experiments in order to show the usefulness of the combined model. Snort was used for the experiment as a signature-based intrusion detection system and extended IBL (Instance-based Learner) was used as the principal learning algorithm for the machine learning-based intrusion detection system. To compare performances of the algorithms, C4.5 was used.

A convenient approach for extracting the stochastic dynamics of a process from log data is that of modelling the process as a Markov model: in this way the discovery of the short/medium range dynamics of the process is cast in terms of the learning of Markov models of different orders, i.e. in terms of learning the corresponding transition matrices. In this paper we show that the use of a full Bayesian approach in the learning process helps providing robustness against statistical noise and over-fitting, as the size of a transition matrix grows exponentially with the order of the model. We give a specific model-model similarity definition and the corresponding calculation procedure to be used in model-to-sequence or sequence-to-sequence conformance assessment, this similarity definition could also be applied to other inferential tasks, such as unsupervised process learning.

Identifying wrist fracture patients with high accuracy by automatic categorization of x-ray reports	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							RADIOLOGY REPORTS	The authors performed this study to determine the accuracy of several text classification methods to categorize wrist x-ray reports. We randomly sampled 751 textual wrist x-ray reports. Two expert reviewers rated the presence (n = 301) or absence (n = 450) of an acute fracture of wrist. We developed two information retrieval (IR) text classification methods and a machine learning method using a support vector machine (TC-1). In cross-validation on the derivation set (n = 493), TC-1 outperformed the two IR based methods and six benchmark classifiers, including Naive Bayes and a Neural Network. In the validation set (n = 258), TC-1 demonstrated consistent performance with 93.8% accuracy; 95.5% sensitivity; 92.9% specificity; and 87.5% positive predictive value. TC-1 was easy to implement and superior in performance to the other classification methods.

J	Li, T; Zhu, SH; Ogihara, M				Li, Tao; Zhu, Shenghuo; Ogihara, Mitsunori			Using discriminant analysis for multi-class classification: an experimental investigation	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						multi-class classification; discriminant analysis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CATEGORIZATION; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM; LDA	Many supervised machine learning tasks can be cast as multi-class classification problems. Support vector machines (SVMs) excel at binary classification problems, but the elegant theory behind large-margin hyperplane cannot be easily extended to their multi-class counterparts. On the other hand, it was shown that the decision hyperplanes for binary classification obtained by SVMs are equivalent to the solutions obtained by Fisher's linear discriminant on the set of support vectors. Discriminant analysis approaches are well known to learn discriminative feature transformations in the statistical pattern recognition literature and can be easily extend to multi-class cases. The use of discriminant analysis, however, has not been fully experimented in the data mining literature. In this paper, we explore the use of discriminant analysis for multi-class classification problems. We evaluate the performance of discriminant analysis on a large collection of benchmark datasets and investigate its usage in text categorization. Our experiments suggest that discriminant analysis provides a fast, efficient yet accurate alternative for general multi-class classification problems.

J	Joseph, A; Fenton, NE; Neil, M				Joseph, A.; Fenton, N. E.; Neil, M.			Predicting football results using Bayesian nets and other machine learning techniques	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian nets; machine learning; football		Bayesian networks (BNs) provide a means for representing, displaying, and making available in a usable form the knowledge of experts in a given field. In this paper, we look at the performance of an expert constructed BN compared with other machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting the outcome (win, lose, or draw) of matches played by Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. The period under study was 1995-1997 - the expert BN was constructed at the start of that period, based almost exclusively on subjective judgement. Our objective was to determine retrospectively the comparative accuracy of the expert BN compared to some alternative ML models that were built using data from the two-year period. The additional ML techniques considered were: MC4, a decision tree learner; Naive Bayesian learner; Data Driven Bayesian (a BN whose structure and node probability tables are learnt entirely from data); and a K-nearest neighbour learner. The results show that the expert BN is generally superior to the other techniques for this domain in predictive accuracy. The results are even more impressive for BNs given that, in a number of key respects, the study assumptions place them at a disadvantage. For example, we have assumed that the BN prediction is 'incorrect' if a BN predicts more than one outcome as equally most likely (whereas, in fact, such a prediction would prove valuable to somebody who could place an 'each way' bet on the outcome). Although the expert BN has now long been irrelevant (since it contains variables relating to key players who have retired or left the club) the results here tend to confirm the excellent potential of BNs when they are built by a reliable domain expert. The ability to provide accurate predictions without requiring much learning data are an obvious bonus in any domain where data are scarce. Moreover, the BN was relatively simple for the expert to build and its structure could be used again in this and similar types of problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Galitsky, B				Galitsky, Boris			Reasoning about attitudes of complaining customers	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						reasoning about mental attitudes; BDI model; customer complaints; CRM	INFORMATION; TRUST	The paper introduces a knowledge engineering methodology to handle scenarios of inter-human interaction. We focus on the attitudes of the conflicting agents, building the formal framework for the representation of these scenarios as sequences of mental actions of the agents. Developed framework facilitates a domain-independent comparative analysis of the textual scenarios of inter-human interactions, as well as a machine learning technique for estimation of the attitudes of involved agents. The formal model for a special case of conflict (customer complaint) is built and the developed framework is applied to justify the scenario as being a valid (consistent, plausible) or invalid complaint. The result of this study is that complaint validity assessment is possible, taking into account the information about mental actions of involved agents only. A formal representation of the mental world of complainants is constructed, where the mental actions are defined in terms of their beliefs and intentions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inductive learning models with missing values	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						missing values; decision tree; decision theory; data mining; machine learning	INCOMPLETE INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; ROUGH SET APPROACH; RULES; CLASSIFICATION	In this paper, a new approach to working with missing attribute values in inductive learning algorithms is introduced. Three fundamental issues are studied: the splitting criterion, the allocation of values to missing attribute values, and the prediction of new observations. The formal definition for the splitting criterion is given. This definition takes into account the missing attribute values and generalizes the classical definition. In relation to the second objective, multiple values are assigned to missing attribute values using a decision theory approach. Each of these multiple values will have an associated confidence and error parameter. The error parameter measures how near or how far the value is from the original value of the attribute. After applying a splitting criterion, a decision tree is obtained (from training sets with or without missing attribute values). This decision tree can be used to predict the class of an observation (with or without missing attribute values). Hence, there are four perspectives. The three perspectives with missing attribute values are studied and experimental results are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the aim is to complement these schemes with rules that predict H-bonding in crystals from 2D structural information only. Modern computational power and the advances in inductive logic programming (ILP) can now provide computational chemistry with the opportunity for extracting structure-specific rules from large databases that can be incorporated into expert systems. ILP technology is here applied to H-bonding in crystals to develop a self-extracting expert system utilizing data in the Cambridge Structural Database of small molecule crystal structures. A clear increase in performance was observed when the ILP system DMAX was allowed to refer to the local structural environment of the possible H-bond donor/acceptor pairs. This ability distinguishes ILP from more traditional approaches that build rules on the basis of global molecular properties.

J	Fushiki, T; Horiuchi, S; Tsuchiya, T				Fushiki, Tadayoshi; Horiuchi, Shingo; Tsuchiya, Takashi			A maximum likelihood approach to density estimation with semidefinite programming	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							DETERMINANT MAXIMIZATION; MATRIX; OPTIMIZATION	Density estimation plays an important and fundamental role in pattern recognition, machine learning, and statistics. In this article, we develop a parametric approach to univariate (or low-dimensional) density estimation based on semidefinite programming (SDP). Our density model is expressed as the product of a nonnegative polynomial and a base density such as normal distribution, exponential distribution, and uniform distribution. When the base density is specified, the maximum likelihood estimation of the polynomial is formulated as a variant of SDP that is solved in polynomial time with the interior point methods. Since the base density typically contains just one or two parameters, computation of the maximum likelihood estimate reduces to a one- or two-dimensional easy optimization problem with this use of SDP. Thus, the rigorous maximum likelihood estimate can be computed in our approach. Furthermore, such conditions as symmetry and unimodality of the density function can be easily handled within this framework. AIC is used to choose the best model. Through applications to several instances, we demonstrate flexibility of the model and performance of the proposed procedure. Combination with a mixture approach is also presented. The proposed approach has possible other applications beyond density estimation. This point is clarified through an application to the maximum likelihood estimation of the intensity function of a nonstationary Poisson process.

The proposed method is based on a hybrid method that uses fuzzy weighted pre-processing and artificial immune recognition system (AIRS). Artificial immune recognition system has showed an effective performance on several problems such as machine learning benchmark problems and medical classification problems like breast cancer, diabetes, liver disorders classification. The robustness of the proposed method is examined using classification accuracy, k-fold cross-validation method and confusion matrix. The obtained classification accuracy is 96.30% and it is very promising compared to the previously reported classification techniques. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we introduce a method for identifying histidines and eysteines that participate in binding of several transition metals and iron complexes. The method predicts histidines as being in either of two states (free or metal bound) and cysteines in either of three states (free, metal bound, or in disulfide bridges). The method uses only sequence information by utilizing position-specific evolutionary profiles as well as more global descriptors such as protein length and amino acid composition. Our solution is based on a two-stage machine-learning approach. The first stage consists of a support vector machine trained to locally classify the binding state of single histidines and cysteines. The second stage consists of a bidirectional recurrent neural network trained to refine local predictions by taking into account dependencies among residues within the same protein. A simple finite state automaton is employed as a postprocessing in the second stage in order to enforce an even number of disulfide-bonded cysteines. We predict histidines and cysteines in transition-metal-binding sites at 73% precision and 61% recall. We observe significant differences in performance depending on the ligand (histidine or cysteine) and on the metal bound. We also predict cysteines participating in disulfide bridges at 86% precision and 87% recall. Results are compared to those that would be obtained by using expert information as represented by PROSITE motifs and, for is fide bonds, to state-of-the-art methods.

J	Hamady, M; Betterton, MD; Knight, R				Hamady, Micah; Betterton, M.

Because transferred genes perform many medically important functions, such as conferring antibiotic resistance, improved detection of horizontally transferred genes from sequence data would be an important advance. Existing sequence-based methods for detecting HGT focus on changes in nucleotide composition or on differences between gene and genome phylogenies; these methods have high error rates. Results: First, we introduce a new class of methods for detecting HGT based on the changes in nucleotide substitution rates that occur when a gene is transferred to a new organism. Our new methods discriminate simulated HGT events with an error rate up to 10 times lower than does GC content. Use of models that are not time-reversible is crucial for detecting HGT. Second, we show that using combinations of multiple predictors of HGT offers substantial improvements over using any single predictor, yielding as much as a factor of 18 improvement in performance (a maximum reduction in error rate from 38% to about 3%). Multiple predictors were combined by using the random forests machine learning algorithm to identify optimal classifiers that separate HGT from non-HGT trees. Conclusion: The new class of HGT-detection methods introduced here combines advantages of phylogenetic and compositional HGT-detection techniques. These new techniques offer order-of-magnitude improvements over compositional methods because they are better able to discriminate HGT from non-HGT trees under a wide range of simulated conditions. We also found that combining multiple measures of HGT is essential for detecting a wide range of HGT events. These novel indicators of horizontal transfer will be widely useful in detecting HGT events linked to the evolution of important bacterial traits, such as antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

Samples on which the target function has a large margin (gamma) convey more information since they yield more accurate hypotheses. Let X be a finite domain and S denote the set of all samples S subset of X of fixed cardinality in. Let H be a class of hypotheses h on X. A hyperconcept h' is defined as an indicator function for a set A subset of S of all samples on which the corresponding hypothesis h has a margin of at least gamma. An estimate on the complexity of the class H' of hyperconcepts h' is obtained with explicit dependence on gamma, the pseudo-dimension of H and m. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Sorek, R; Dror, G; Shamir, R				Sorek, Rotem; Dror, Gideon; Shamir, Ron			Assessing the number of ancestral alternatively spliced exons in the human genome	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							HUMAN GENES; MOUSE; IDENTIFICATION; CONSERVATION; SEQUENCES	Background: It is estimated that between 35% and 74% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing. However, as a gene that undergoes alternative splicing can have between one and dozens of alternative exons, the number of alternatively spliced genes by itself is not informative enough. An additional parameter, which was not addressed so far, is therefore the number of human exons that undergo alternative splicing. We have previously described an accurate machine-learning method allowing the detection of conserved alternatively spliced exons without using ESTs, which relies on specific features of the exon and its genomic vicinity that distinguish alternatively spliced exons from constitutive ones. Results: In this study we use the above-described approach to calculate that 7.2% (+/- 1.1%) of all human exons that are conserved in mouse are alternatively spliced in both species. Conclusion: This number is the first estimation for the extent of ancestral alternatively spliced exons in the human genome.

SNP-PHAGE - High throughput SNP discovery pipeline	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; TOOL; VISUALIZATION	Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as defined here are single base sequence changes or short insertion/deletions between or within individuals of a given species. As a result of their abundance and the availability of high throughput analysis technologies SNP markers have begun to replace other traditional markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs or microsatellite) markers for fine mapping and association studies in several species. For SNP discovery from chromatogram data, several bioinformatics programs have to be combined to generate an analysis pipeline. Results have to be stored in a relational database to facilitate interrogation through queries or to generate data for further analyses such as determination of linkage disequilibrium and identification of common haplotypes. Although these tasks are routinely performed by several groups, an integrated open source SNP discovery pipeline that can be easily adapted by new groups interested in SNP marker development is currently unavailable. Results: We developed SNP-PHAGE (SNP discovery Pipeline with additional features for identification of common haplotypes within a sequence tagged site (Haplotype Analysis) and GenBank (-dbSNP) submissions. This tool was applied for analyzing sequence traces from diverse soybean genotypes to discover over 10,000 SNPs. This package was developed on UNIX/Linux platform, written in Per1 and uses a MySQL database. Scripts to generate a user-friendly web interface are also provided with common queries for preliminary data analysis. A machine learning tool developed by this group for increasing the efficiency of SNP discovery is integrated as a part of this package as an optional feature. The SNP-PHAGE package is being made available open source at http://bfgl.anri.barc.usda.gov/ML/snp-phage/. Conclusion: SNP-PHAGE provides a bioinformatics solution for high throughput SNP discovery, identification of common haplotypes within an amplicon, and GenBank (dbSNP) submissions. SNP selection and visualization are aided through a user-friendly web interface. This tool is useful for analyzing sequence tagged sites (STSs) of genomic sequences, and this software can serve as a starting point for groups interested in developing SNP markers.

J	Chen, DY; Li, X; Dong, ZY; Chen, X				Chen, Ding-Yi; Li, Xue; Dong, Zhao Yang; Chen, Xia			Fitness assessment of document model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						document classification; document model; fitness measurement	TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Document classification is a supervised machine learning process, where predefined category labels are assigned to documents based on the hypothesis derived from training set of labelled documents. Documents cannot be directly interpreted by a computer system unless they have been modelled as a collection of computable features. Rogati and Yang [M. Rogati and Y. Yang, "Resource selection for domain-specific cross-lingual IR", in SIGIR 2004: Proceedings of the 27th annual international conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, ACM Press, Sheffied: United Kingdom, pp. 154-161.] pointed out that the effectiveness of document classification system may vary in different domains. This implies that the quality of document model contributes to the effectiveness of document classification. Conventionally, model evaluation is accomplished by comparing the effectiveness scores of classifiers on model candidates. However, this kind of evaluation methods may encounter either under-fitting or over-fitting problems, because the effectiveness scores are restricted by the learning capacities of classifiers. We propose a model fitness evaluation method to determine whether a model is sufficient to distinguish positive and negative instances while still competent to provide satisfactory effectiveness with a small feature subset. Our experiments demonstrated how the fitness of models are assessed. The results of our work contribute to the researches of feature selection, dimensionality reduction and document classification.

J	Peng, YH				Peng, Yonghong			Integration of gene functional diversity for effective cancer detection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						cancer detection; microarray; integration	EXPRESSION DATA; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; SELECTION; ARRAYS; TUMOR	DNA microarray technology has demonstrated to be an effective methodology for the diagnosis of diseases and cancers by means of expression data classification. Although much research has been conducted during the recent years to apply machine learning techniques for microarray data classification, there are two important issues that prevent the use of conventional machine learning techniques, namely the limited availability of training samples and the existence of various uncertainties. This article presents an integrative classification system, based on the ensemble of machine learning, to integrate the diverse functions of multiple groups of genes in order to achieve a robust microarray data classification. Ensemble learning combines a set of base classifiers as a committee to make more appropriate decisions when classifying new data instances. In order to enhance the performance of the ensemble learning process, the approach presented includes a procedure to select optimal ensemble members based on their classification behaviour. The proposed approach has been verified by three microarray data sets for cancer detection. Experimental results showed that the performance of cancer detection can be much improved by integrating a different subgroup of genes, which suggests, instead of seeking individual gene makers, that a robust cancer detection system can be developed based on integration of related gene groups with diverse functions.

In this article, we present E-CIDIM, a multiple classifier system designed to improve the performance of CIDIM, and FE-CIDIM, an algorithm developed to speed up E-CIDIM. CIDIM is an algorithm that induces small and accurate decision trees. E-CIDIM keeps a maximum number of trees and induces new trees that may substitute the old trees in the ensemble. The substitution process finishes when none of the new trees improves the accuracy of any of the trees in the ensemble after a preconfigured number of attempts. FE-CIDIM has been developed to speed up the convergence of E-CIDIM using a more restrictive substitution method. We will show that the accuracy obtained thanks to a unique instance of CIDIM can be improved utilizing these new multiple classifier systems.

J.; DeLisi, Charles; Kasif, Simon			Towards the identification of essential genes using targeted genome sequencing and comparative analysis	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE GENOME; PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORKS; YEAST; EVOLUTION; DISPENSABILITY; BACTERIA; TOPOLOGY; LEVEL; BIAS; RNAI	Background: The identification of genes essential for survival is of theoretical importance in the understanding of the minimal requirements for cellular life, and of practical importance in the identification of potential drug targets in novel pathogens. With the great time and expense required for experimental studies aimed at constructing a catalog of essential genes in a given organism, a computational approach which could identify essential genes with high accuracy would be of great value. Results: We gathered numerous features which could be generated automatically from genome sequence data and assessed their relationship to essentiality, and subsequently utilized machine learning to construct an integrated classifier of essential genes in both S. cerevisiae and E. coli. When looking at single features, phyletic retention, a measure of the number of organisms an ortholog is present in, was the most predictive of essentiality. Furthermore, during construction of our phyletic retention feature we for the first time explored the evolutionary relationship among the set of organisms in which the presence of a gene is most predictive of essentiality. We found that in both E. coli and S. cerevisiae the optimal sets always contain host-associated organisms with small genomes which are closely related to the reference. Using five optimally selected organisms, we were able to improve predictive accuracy as compared to using all available sequenced organisms. We hypothesize the predictive power of these genomes is a consequence of the process of reductive evolution, by which many parasites and symbionts evolved their gene content. In addition, essentiality is measured in rich media, a condition which resembles the environments of these organisms in their hosts where many nutrients are provided. Finally, we demonstrate that integration of our most highly predictive features using a probabilistic classifier resulted in accuracies surpassing any individual feature. Conclusion: Using features obtainable directly from sequence data, we were able to construct a classifier which can predict essential genes with high accuracy. Furthermore, our analysis of the set of genomes in which the presence of a gene is most predictive of essentiality may suggest ways in which targeted sequencing can be used in the identification of essential genes. In summary, the methods presented here can aid in the reduction of time and money invested in essential gene identification by targeting those genes for experimentation which are predicted as being essential with a high probability.

J	Rothfuss, A; Steger-Hartmann, T; Heinrich, N; Wichard, J				Rothfuss, Andreas; Steger-Hartmann, Thomas; Heinrich, Nikolaus; Wichard, Joerg			Computational prediction of the chromosome-damaging potential of chemicals	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							PROGRAMS DEREK; GENOTOXICITY; ABERRATIONS; MUTAGENICITY; SENSITIVITY; TOPKAT; ASSAY; SAR	We report on the generation of computer- based models for the prediction of the chromosome-damaging potential of chemicals as assessed in the in Vitro chromosome aberration (CA) test. On the basis of publicly available CA-test results of more than 650 chemical substances, half of which are drug-like compounds, we generated two different computational models. The first model was realized using the (Q) SAR tool MCASE. Results obtained with this model indicate a limited performance (53%) for the assessment of a chromosome-damaging potential (sensitivity), whereas CA- test negative compounds were correctly predicted with a specificity of 75%. The low sensitivity of this model might be explained by the fact that the underlying 2D-structural descriptors only describe part of the molecular mechanism leading to the induction of chromosome aberrations, that is, direct drug-DNA interactions. The second model was constructed with a more sophisticated machine learning approach and generated a classification model based on 14 molecular descriptors, which were obtained after feature selection. The performance of this model was superior to the MCASE model, primarily because of an improved sensitivity, suggesting that the more complex molecular descriptors in combination with statistical learning approaches are better suited to model the complex nature of mechanisms leading to a positive effect in the CA- test. An analysis of misclassified pharmaceuticals by this model showed that a large part of the false-negative predicted compounds were uniquely positive in the CA- test but lacked a genotoxic potential in other mutagenicity tests of the regulatory testing battery, suggesting that biologically nonsignificant mechanisms could be responsible for the observed positive CA- test result. Since such mechanisms are not amenable to modeling approaches it is suggested that a positive prediction made by the model reflects a biologically significant genotoxic potential. An integration of the machine-learning model as a screening tool in early discovery phases of drug development is proposed.

Star-galaxy classification of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR3 using decision trees	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astronomical data bases : miscellaneous; catalogs; methods : data analysis; surveys	SPECTROSCOPIC TARGET SELECTION; DATA RELEASE; CATALOG; SAMPLE; IMAGES	We provide classifications for all 143 million nonrepeat photometric objects in the Third Data Release of the SDSS using decision trees trained on 477,068 objects with SDSS spectroscopic data. We demonstrate that these star/galaxy classifications are expected to be reliable for approximately 22 million objects with r less than or similar to 20. The general machine learning environment Data-to-Knowledge and supercomputing resources enabled extensive investigation of the decision tree parameter space. This work presents the first public release of objects classified in this way for an entire SDSS data release. The objects are classified as either galaxy, star, or nsng ( neither star nor galaxy), with an associated probability for each class. To demonstrate how to effectively make use of these classifications, we perform several important tests. First, we detail selection criteria within the probability space defined by the three classes to extract samples of stars and galaxies to a given completeness and efficiency. Second, we investigate the efficacy of the classifications and the effect of extrapolating from the spectroscopic regime by performing blind tests on objects in the SDSS, 2dFGRS, and 2QZ surveys. Given the photometric limits of our spectroscopic training data, we effectively begin to extrapolate past our star-galaxy training set at r similar to 18. By comparing the number counts of our training sample with the classified sources, however, we find that our efficiencies appear to remain robust to r similar to 20. As a result, we expect our classifications to be accurate for 900,000 galaxies and 6.7 million stars and remain robust via extrapolation for a total of 8.0 million galaxies and 13.9 million stars.

J	Tan, KC; Yu, Q; Ang, JH				Tan, K. C.; Yu, Q.; Ang, J. H.			A coevolutionary algorithm for rules discovery in data mining	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						evolutionary algorithms; data mining; classification	LEARNING CLASSIFIER SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; EXTRACTION; DIAGNOSIS; SELECTION	One of the major challenges in data mining is the extraction of comprehensible knowledge from recorded data. In this paper, a coevolutionary-based classification technique, namely COevolutionary Rule Extractor (CORE), is proposed to discover classification rules in data mining. Unlike existing approaches where candidate rules and rule sets are evolved at different stages in the classification process, the proposed CORE coevolves rules and rule sets concurrently in two cooperative populations to confine the search space and to produce good rule sets that are comprehensive. The proposed coevolutionary classification technique is extensively validated upon seven datasets obtained from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which are representative artificial and real-world data from various domains. Comparison results show that the proposed CORE produces comprehensive and good classification rules for most datasets, which are competitive as compared with existing classifiers in literature. Simulation results obtained from box plots also unveil that CORE is relatively robust and invariant to random partition of datasets.

STAR: predicting recombination sites from amino acid sequence	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; PROTEIN RECOMBINATION; STABILITY CHANGES; EVOLUTION; ENZYMES; NUMBER	Background: Designing novel proteins with site-directed recombination has enormous prospects. By locating effective recombination sites for swapping sequence parts, the probability that hybrid sequences have the desired properties is increased dramatically. The prohibitive requirements for applying current tools led us to investigate machine learning to assist in finding useful recombination sites from amino acid sequence alone. Results: We present STAR, Site Targeted Amino acid Recombination predictor, which produces a score indicating the structural disruption caused by recombination, for each position in an amino acid sequence. Example predictions contrasted with those of alternative tools, illustrate STAR'S utility to assist in determining useful recombination sites. Overall, the correlation coefficient between the output of the experimentally validated protein design algorithm SCHEMA and the prediction of STAR is very high (0.89). Conclusion: STAR allows the user to explore useful recombination sites in amino acid sequences with unknown structure and unknown evolutionary origin.

Method-specific dynamic compilation using logistic regression	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						performance; experimentation; languages; compiler optimization; machine learning; logistic regression; Java; Jikes RVM		Determining the best set of optimizations to apply to a program has been a long standing problem for compiler writers. To reduce the complexity of this task, existing approaches typically apply the same set of optimizations to all procedures within a program, without regard to their particular structure. This paper develops a new method-specific approach that automatically selects the best optimizations on a per method basis within a dynamic compiler. Our approach uses the machine learning technique of logistic regression to automatically derive a predictive model that determines which optimizations to apply based on the features of a method. This technique is implemented in the Jikes RVM Java JIT compiler. Using this approach we reduce the average total execution time of the SPECjvm98 benchmarks by 29%. When the same heuristic is applied to the DaCapo+ benchmark suite, we obtain an average 33% reduction over the default level O2 setting.

A fuzzy resemblance relation concept is used to set up a mathematical framework for measuring the degree of similarity between the input-output behavior of a simulation model and the corresponding behavior of the real system. A neuro-fuzzy inference algorithm is employed to automatically learn the required resemblance relation from real and simulated data. Ultimately, defuzzification strategies are applied to obtain a coefficient on the unit interval that characterizes the degree of model validity. An example in the airline industry illustrates the practical application of this methodology.

The "COSSO" is a method of regularization with the penalty functional being the sum of component norms, instead of the squared norm employed in the traditional smoothing spline method. The COSSO provides a unified framework for several recent proposals for model selection in linear models and smoothing spline ANOVA models. Theoretical properties, such as the existence and the rate of convergence of the COSSO estimator, are studied. In the special case of a tensor product design with periodic functions, a detailed analysis reveals that the COSSO does model selection by applying a novel soft thresholding type operation to the function components. We give an equivalent formulation of the COSSO estimator which leads naturally to an iterative algorithm. We compare the COSSO with MARS, a popular method that builds functional ANOVA models, in simulations and real examples. The COSSO method can be extended to classification problems and we compare its performance with those of a number of machine learning algorithms on real datasets. The COSSO gives very competitive performance in these studies.

J	Culotta, A; Kristjansson, T; McCallum, A; Viola, P				Culotta, Aron; Kristjansson, Trausti; McCallum, Andrew; Viola, Paul			Corrective feedback and persistent learning for information extraction	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						information extraction; active learning; graphical models		To successfully embed statistical machine learning models in real world applications, two post-deployment capabilities must be provided: (1) the ability to solicit user corrections and (2) the ability to update the model from these corrections. We refer to the former capability as corrective feedback and the latter as persistent learning. While these capabilities have a natural implementation for simple classification tasks such as spam filtering, we argue that a more careful design is required for structured classification tasks. One example of a structured classification task is information extraction, in which raw text is analyzed to automatically populate a database. In this work, we augment a probabilistic information extraction system with corrective feedback and persistent learning components to assist the user in building, correcting, and updating the extraction model. We describe methods of guiding the user to incorrect predictions, suggesting the most informative fields to correct, and incorporating corrections into the inference algorithm. We also present an active learning framework that minimizes not only how many examples a user must label, but also how difficult each example is to label. We empirically validate each of the technical components in simulation and quantify the user effort saved. We conclude that more efficient corrective feedback mechanisms lead to more effective persistent learning. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A novel structure-based encoding for machine-learning applied to the inference of SH3 domain specificity	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; PREDICTION; MODULES; SRC; INFORMATION; MUTATIONS; SEQUENCES	Motivation: Unravelling the rules underlying protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions is a crucial step in understanding cell machinery. Peptide recognition modules (PRMs) are globular protein domains which focus their binding targets on short protein sequences and play a key role in the frame of protein-protein interactions. High-throughput techniques permit the whole proteome scanning of each domain, but they are characterized by a high incidence of false positives. In this context, there is a pressing need for the development of in silico experiments to validate experimental results and of computational tools for the inference of domain-peptide interactions. Results: We focused on the SH3 domain family and developed a machine-learning approach for inferring interaction specificity. SH3 domains are well-studied PRMs which typically bind proline-rich short sequences characterized by the PxxP consensus. The binding information is known to be held in the conformation of the domain surface and in the short sequence of the peptide. Our method relies on interaction data from high-throughput techniques and benefits from the integration of sequence and structure data of the interacting partners. Here, we propose a novel encoding technique aimed at representing binding information on the basis of the domain-peptide contact residues in complexes of known structure. Remarkably, the new encoding requires few variables to represent an interaction, thus avoiding the 'curse of dimension'. Our results display an accuracy > 90% in detecting new binders of known SH3 domains, thus outperforming neural models on standard binary encodings, profile methods and recent statistical predictors. The method, moreover, shows a generalization capability, inferring specificity of unknown SH3 domains displaying some degree of similarity with the known data.

J	Cawley, GC; Talbot, NLC				Cawley, Gavin C.; Talbot, Nicola L. C.			Gene selection in cancer classification using sparse logistic regression with Bayesian regularization	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							EXPRESSION DATA; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS	Motivation: Gene selection algorithms for cancer classification, based on the expression of a small number of biomarker genes, have been the subject of considerable research in recent years. Shevade and Keerthi propose a gene selection algorithm based on sparse logistic regression (SLogReg) incorporating a Laplace prior to promote sparsity in the model parameters, and provide a simple but efficient training procedure. The degree of sparsity obtained is determined by the value of a regularization parameter, which must be carefully tuned in order to optimize performance. This normally involves a model selection stage, based on a computationally intensive search for the minimizer of the cross-validation error. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple Bayesian approach can be taken to eliminate this regularization parameter entirely, by integrating it out analytically using an uninformative Jeffrey's prior. The improved algorithm (BLogReg) is then typically two or three orders of magnitude faster than the original algorithm, as there is no longer a need for a model selection step. The BLogReg algorithm is also free from selection bias in performance estimation, a common pitfall in the application of machine learning algorithms in cancer classification. Results: The SLogReg, BLogReg and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) gene selection algorithms are evaluated over the well-studied colon cancer and leukaemia benchmark datasets. The leave-one-out estimates of the probability of test error and cross-entropy of the BLogReg and SLogReg algorithms are very similar, however the BlogReg algorithm is found to be considerably faster than the original SLogReg algorithm. Using nested cross-validation to avoid selection bias, performance estimation for SLogReg on the leukaemia dataset takes almost 48 h, whereas the corresponding result for BLogReg is obtained in only 1 min 24 s, making BLogReg by far the more practical algorithm. BLogReg also demonstrates better estimates of conditional probability than the RVM, which are of great importance in medical applications, with similar computational expense.

J	Polat, K; Gunes, S				Polat, Kemal; Guenes, Salih			Automated identification of diseases related to lymph system from lymphography data using artificial immune recognition system with fuzzy resource allocation mechanism (fuzzy-AIRS)	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Fuzzy resource allocation; AIRS; Lymph diseases; k-Fold cross-validation; Expert system		Artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) classification algorithm, which has an important place among classification algorithms in the field of artificial immune systems, has showed an effective and intriguing performance oil the problems it was applied. AIRS was previously applied to some medical classification problems including breast cancer, Cleveland heart disease, diabetes and it obtained very satisfactory results. So, AIRS proved to be,in efficient artificial intelligence technique in medical field. In this study, the resource allocation mechanism of AIRS was changed with a new one determined by fuzzy-logic. This system, named as fuzzy-AIRS was used as a classifier in the diagnosis of lymph diseases, which is of great importance in medicine. The classifications of lymph diseases dataset taken from University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository were done using 10-fold cross-validation method. Reached classification accuracies were evaluated by comparing them with reported classifiers in UCI web site in addition to other systems that are applied to the related problems. Also, the obtained classification performances were compared with AIRS with regard to the classification accuracy, number of resources and classification time. While only AIRS algorithm obtained 83.138% classification accuracy, fuzzy-AIRS classified the lymph diseases dataset with 90.00% accuracy. For lymph diseases dataset, fuzzy-AIRS obtained the highest classification accuracy according to the UCI web site, Beside of this success, fuzzy-AIRS gained an important advantage over the AIRS by means of classification time. By reducing classification time as well as obtaining high classification accuracies in the applied datasets, fuzzy-AIRS classifier proved that it could be used as an effective classifier for medical problems.

In this paper, a novel idea of distance, Hit-Distance, was proposed to generalize the representational capacity of available prototypes. It is more reasonable to utilize the proposed hit-distance to describe the distance between any given point and any matter subspace. The effectiveness of the proposed distance was indirectly evaluated by some experiments of matter classifications. Experiments were performed on 8 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was shown that the hit-distance based classifiers performed much better than the classical nearest neighbor classifier (NN), the Nearest feature line method (NFL) and the Nearest feature plane method (NFP).

Genes for the majority of group A streptococcal virulence factors and extracellular surface proteins do not confer an increased propensity to cause invasive disease	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; EPIDEMIOLOGIC FEATURES; PYROGENIC EXOTOXINS; PYOGENES; INFECTIONS; NETHERLANDS; CLONE; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; RELATEDNESS	Background. The factors behind the reemergence of severe, invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) diseases are unclear, but it could be caused by altered genetic endowment in these organisms. However, data from previous studies assessing the association between single genetic factors and invasive disease are often conflicting, suggesting that other, as-yet unidentified factors are necessary for the development of this class of disease. Methods. In this study, we used a targeted GAS virulence microarray containing 226 GAS genes to determine the virulence gene repertoires of 68 GAS isolates (42 associated with invasive disease and 28 associated with noninvasive disease) collected in a defined geographic location during a contiguous time period. We then employed 3 advanced machine learning methods (genetic algorithm neural network, support vector machines, and classification trees) to identify genes with an increased association with invasive disease. Results. Virulence gene profiles of individual GAS isolates varied extensively among these geographically and temporally related strains. Using genetic algorithm neural network analysis, we identified 3 genes with a marginal overrepresentation in invasive disease isolates. Significantly, 2 of these genes, ssa and mf4, encoded superantigens but were only present in a restricted set of GAS M-types. The third gene, spa, was found in variable distributions in all M-types in the study. Conclusions. Our comprehensive analysis of GAS virulence profiles provides strong evidence for the incongruent relationships among any of the 226 genes represented on the array and the overall propensity of GAS to cause invasive disease, underscoring the pathogenic complexity of these diseases, as well as the importance of multiple bacteria and/ or host factors.

J	Williams, N; Zander, S; Armitage, G				Williams, Nigel; Zander, Sebastian; Armitage, Grenville			A preliminary performance comparison of five machine learning algorithms for practical IP traffic flow classification	COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW			English	Review						algorithms; measurement; traffic classification; machine learning		The identification of network applications through observation of associated packet traffic flows is vital to the areas of network management and surveillance. Currently popular methods such as port number and payload-based identification exhibit a number of shortfalls. An alternative is to use machine learning (ML) techniques and identify network applications based on per-flow statistics, derived from payload-independent features such as packet length and inter-arrival time distributions. The performance impact of feature set reduction, using Consistency-based and Correlation-based feature selection, is demonstrated on Naive Bayes, C4.5, Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes Tree algorithms. We then show that it is useful to differentiate algorithms based on computational performance rather than classification accuracy alone, as although classification accuracy between the algorithms is similar, computational performance can differ significantly.

J	Yoon, K; Brew, C				Yoon, Kyuchul; Brew, Chris			A linguistically motivated approach to grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for Korean	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article								This paper describes a hand-written rule-based grapheme-to-phoneme (GTP) conversion system for Korean built within the Festival text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis framework. The core of the GTP conversion system is a simple implementation of nine linguistically motivated morphophonological rules. These rules, which are well known to students of Korean linguistics, were implemented in Festival rewrite formalism ism, and were applied to 1.3 million distinct orthographic words (space-delimited eojeols) from the Korean Newswire corpus. The outputs were evaluated against a representative subset of eojeols. The subset was examined by three native speakers of Korean,,who judged 91.17% of the word types in a stratified sample of Korean eojeols to be acceptable pronunciations, which means that our system converted. 99.63% of the grapheme tokens correctly. This performance is comparable to that obtained from earlier studies such as Kim et al. [Morpheme-based grapheme to phoneme conversion using phonetic patterns and morphophonemic connectivity information. ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing 1 (1) (2002) 65-82] which, contrary to our system, used an elaborate morphological analysis module. This is evidence of the potential benefit of welt-abstracted linguistic knowledge. In addition, because our approach is based on well-known linguistic principles, error analysis is fairly straightforward. Straightforward error analysis is an essential step in knowing what features are likely to be informative in training a hybrid system where exceptions to rules are handled by a machine-learning component.

J	Liu, Y; Chawla, NV; Harper, MR; Shriberg, E; Stolcke, A				Liu, Yang; Chawla, Nitesh V.; Harper, Mary R.; Shriberg, Elizabeth; Stolcke, Andreas			A study in machine learning from imbalanced data for sentence boundary detection in speech	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; STRENGTH; PROSODY	Enriching speech recognition output with sentence boundaries improves its human readability and enables further processing by downstream language processing modules. We have constructed a hidden Markov model (HMM) system to detect sentence boundaries that uses both prosodic and textual information. Since there are more nonsentence boundaries than sentence boundaries in the data, the prosody model, which is implemented as a decision tree classifier, must be constructed to effectively learn from the imbalanced data distribution. To address this problem, we investigate a variety of sampling approaches and a bagging scheme. A pilot study was carried out to select methods to apply to the full NIST sentence boundary evaluation task across two corpora (conversational telephone speech and broadcast news speech), using both human transcriptions and recognition output. In the pilot study, when classification error rate is the performance measure, using the original training set achieves the best performance among the sampling methods, and an ensemble of multiple classifiers from different downsampled training sets achieves slightly poorer performance, but has the potential to reduce computational effort. However, when performance is measured using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) or area under the curve (AUC), then the sampling approaches outperform the original training set. This observation is important if the sentence boundary detection output. is used by downstream language processing modules. Bagging was found to significantly improve system performance for each of the sampling methods. The gain from these methods may be diminished when the prosody model is combined with the language model, which is,a strong knowledge source for the sentence detection task. The. patterns found in the pilot study were replicated in the full NIST evaluation task. The conclusions may be dependent on the task, the classifiers, and the knowledge combination approach.

J	Wanner, L; Bohnet, B; Giereth, M				Wanner, Leo; Bohnet, Bernd; Giereth, Mark			Making sense of collocations	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	Lexico-semantic collocations (LSCs) are a prominent type of multiword expressions. Over the last decade, the automatic compilation of LSCs from text corpora has been addressed in a significant number of works. However, very often, the output of an LSC-extraction program is a plain list of LSCs. Being useful as raw material for dictionary construction, plain lists of LSCs are of a rather limited use in NLP-applications. For NLP, LSCs must,be assigned syntactic and, especially, semantic information. Our goal is to develop an "off-the-shelf" LSC-acquisition program that annotates each LSC identified in the corpus with its syntax and semantics. In this article, we address the annotation task as a classification task,viewing it as a machine learning problem. The LSC-typology we use are the lexical functions from the Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology; as lexico-semantic resource, EuroWordnet has been used. The applied machine learning technique is a variant of the nearest neighbor-family, which is defined over lexico-semantic features of the elements:of LSCs. The technique has been tested on Spanish verb-noun bigrams. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The application of machine learning techniques in other areas such as pattern recognition has resulted in accumulated experience as to correct and principled approaches for their use. The aim of this paper is to give an account of issues affecting the application of machine learning tools, focusing primarily on general aspects of feature and model parameter selection, rather than any single specific algorithm. These aspects are discussed in the context of published bioinformatics studies in leading journals over the last 5 years. We assess to what degree the experience gained by the pattern recognition research community pervades these bioinformatics studies. We finally discuss various critical issues relating to bioinformatic data sets and make a number of recommendations on the proper use of machine learning techniques for bioinformatics research based upon previously published research on machine learning.

In this paper, employing only protein sequence information, a framework is presented to predict protein-protein interactions using a probabilistic-based tree augmented naive (TAN) Bayesian network. Our framework also provides a confidence level for every predicted interaction, which is useful for further analysis by the biologists. The framework is applied to the yeast interaction datasets for predicting interactions and it is shown that our framework gives better performance than support vector machine (SVM). The framework is implemented as a webserver and is available for prediction. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This facilitates knowledge sharing and re-use by both people and systems. Ontologies are becoming increasingly important in the biomedical domain since they enable knowledge sharing in a formal, homogeneous and unambiguous way. Knowledge in a rapidly growing field such as biomedicine is usually evolving and therefore an ontology maintenance process is required to keep ontological knowledge up-to-date. This work presents our methodology for building a formally defined ontology, maintaining it exploiting machine learning techniques and domain specific corpora, and evaluating it using a well-defined experimental setting.

All docking algorithms make use of a scoring function in combination with a method of search. Two theoretical aspects of scoring function performance dominate operational performance. The first is the degree to which a scoring function has a global extremum within the ligand pose landscape at the proper location. The second is the degree to which the magnitude of the function at the extremum is accurate. Presuming adequate search strategies, a scoring function's location performance will dominate behavior with respect to docking accuracy: the degree to which a predicted pose of a ligand matches experimental observation. A scoring function's magnitude performance will dominate behavior with respect to screening utility: enrichment of true ligands over non-ligands. Magnitude estimation also controls pure scoring accuracy: the degree to which bona fide ligands of a particular protein may be correctly ranked. Approaches to the development of scoring functions have varied widely, with a number of functions yielding similarly high levels of performance relating to the location issue. However, even among functions performing equally well on location, widely varying performance is observed on the question of magnitude. In many cases, performance is good enough to yield high enrichments of true ligands versus non-ligands in screening across a wide variety of protein types. Generally, performance is not good enough to correctly rank among true ligands. Strategies for improvement are discussed.

To prevent this, new biological therapies, such as infliximab, have been successfully developed. The present analysis is based on an expanded access program in which 511 RA patients with chronic refractory disease were treated with infliximab. They received a standard dose of 3 mg/kg on weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and every 8 weeks thereafter. On week 22, the treating rheumatologist evaluated the situation of every patient and decided whether the current dose should be increased or not. This decision can be considered as a measure of insufficient response. In the present analysis, 3 machine-learning classification techniques-the self-organizing map (SOM), multilayered perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM)-are implemented to model the decision to give a dose increase. Their performance on increasingly multivariate real-life data will be studied and compared to classical statistics-linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression (LR). Results show that the SOM is an excellent tool for data visualization but not for classification. All the remaining methods show good classification performance, if configured well. However, as the number of features increases, the performance decreases. The SVM suffers to a lesser degree from this curse of dimensionality. Expectation maximization (EM) comes out as a good method to cope with missing values in such real-life data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Owing to long response delay, revenues of the enterprises are substantially reduced due to many aborted e-commerce transactions. Recently, researchers have been addressing different admission control schemes of differentiated service for web servers to complement the Internet differentiated services model and thereby provide QoS support to the users of the World Wide Web. However, most of these admission control mechanisms do not guarantee the QoS requirements of all admitted clients under bursty workload. Although an Internet service model called proportional differentiated service is enabled in web servers to improve the QoS guarantee predicament in the literature, it still exists some impracticable assumptions and incompatible problems with the current Internet protocols. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for admission control and traffic scheduler schemes of the web server under proportional differentiated service, wherein a time series predictor is embedded to estimate the traffic load of the client in the next measurement time period. Support vector regression and particle swarm optimization techniques are used to implement the time series predictor based on the reports of successful prediction in the literature. The experimental results reveal that the proposed schemes can realize proportional delay differentiation service in multiclass Web server effectively.

This paper proposes a novel method called 'knowledge acquisition via information granulation' (KAIG) model which not only can remove some unnecessary details and provide a better insight into the essence of data but also effectively solve 'class imbalance' problems. In this model, the homogeneity index (H-index) and the undistinguishable ratio (U-ratio) are successfully introduced to determine a suitable level of granularity. We also developed the concept of sub-attributes to describe granules and tackle the overlapping among granules. Seven data sets from UCI data bank, including one imbalanced diagnosis data (pima-Indians-diabetes), are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of KAIG model. By using different performance indexes, overall accuracy, G-mean and Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve, the experimental results comparing with C4.5 and Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrate the superiority of our method.

J	Li, XF; Liu, L; Wu, LH; Zhang, Z				Li, XF; Liu, L; Wu, LH; Zhang, Z			Predicting the final prices of online auction items	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						online auctions; price prediction; machine learning; neural network		With the prevalence of the Internet and e-commerce, the online exchange market, especially the online auction market develops very fast. The activities of online auction produce a large number of transaction data. If utilized properly, these data can be of great benefit to sellers, buyers and website administrator. Typically, the final price prediction results may help sellers optimize the selling price of their items and auction attributes. At the same time, part of the information asymmetry problems may be solved for buyers. Thus, transaction time can be shortened and cost can be saved. In this paper, we collect large amounts of historical exchange data from Eachnet, an online auction website most famous in China and use machine learning algorithms and traditional statistical methods to forecast the final prices of auction items. We propose an attribute construction method to overcome the problem that auction bid list changes dynamically. Some experiments are performed and the prediction results are discussed to verify the proposed solution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uncovering the to-dos hidden in your in-box	IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article							COMMUNICATION	In this paper we present SCOUT, an application that examines the machine-generated messages within the in-box of an e-mail application, extracts from these messages information regarding the tasks the recipient is asked to perform, and displays these messages in a graphical interface where they are grouped by context. The tool is intended for business managers who receive daily a large number of machine-generated messages that require some action be taken. SCOUT uses the IBM Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) framework to apply rule-based reasoning for identification of tasks, and it uses contextual data to customize the presentation of task information to the user. SCOUT's open, extensible architecture allows the use of alternate inference models (such as machine learning algorithms) as well as the integration of additional context sources and client interfaces. SCOUT was well received by the participants in a small evaluation study.

We assume that valuable resources need to be protected against unauthorized users and that, to this aim, a password-based access control scheme is employed. Such an abstract scenario captures many applicative settings. The issue we focus our attention on is the following: Password-based schemes provide a certain level of security as long as users choose good passwords, i.e., passwords that are hard to guess in a reasonable amount of time. In order to force the users to make good choices, a proactive password checker can be implemented as a submodule of the access control scheme. Such a checker, any time the user chooses/changes his own password, decides on the fly whether to accept or refuse the new password, depending on its guessability. Hence, the question is: How can we get an effective and efficient proactive password checker? By means of neural networks and statistical techniques, we answer the above question, developing suitable proactive password checkers. Through a series of experiments, we show that these checkers have very good performance: Error rates are comparable to those of the best existing checkers, implemented on different principles and by using other methodologies, and the memory requirements are better in several cases. It is the first time that neural network technology has been fully and successfully applied to designing proactive password checkers.

Furthermore, an orthonormal basis for these spaces is presented.

J	Ye, JP; Janardan, R; Li, Q; Park, H				Ye, Jieping; Janardan, Ravi; Li, Qi; Park, Haesun			Feature reduction via generalized uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						feature reduction; uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis; QR-decomposition; generalized singular value decomposition	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; UNDERSAMPLED PROBLEMS; CLASSIFICATION	High-dimensional data appear in many applications of data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Feature reduction is commonly applied as a preprocessing step to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Uncorrelated Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA) was recently proposed for feature reduction. The extracted features via ULDA were shown to be statistically uncorrelated, which is desirable for many applications. In this paper, an algorithm called ULDA/QR is proposed to simplify the previous implementation of ULDA. Then, the ULDA/GSVD algorithm is proposed, based on a novel optimization criterion, to address the singularity problem which occurs in undersampled problems, where the data dimension is larger than the sample size. The criterion used is the regularized version of the one in ULDA/QR. Surprisingly, our theoretical result shows that the solution to ULDA/GSVD is independent of the value of the regularization parameter. Experimental results on various types of data sets are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and to compare it with other commonly used feature reduction algorithms.

In this paper, this problem is addressed in the way that a neural network algorithm named BP-MLL, i.e., Backpropagation for Multilabel Learning, is proposed. It is derived from the popular Backpropogation algorithm through employing a novel error function capturing the characteristics of multilabel learning, i.e., the labels belonging to an instance should be ranked higher than those not belonging to that instance. Applications to two real-world multilabel learning problems, i.e., functional genomics and text categorization, show that the performance of BP-MLL is superior to that of some well-established multilabel learning algorithms.

J	Zhu, XQ; Wu, XD				Zhu, Xingquan; Wu, Xindong			Class noise handling for effective cost-sensitive learning by cost-guided iterative classification filtering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; classification; cost-sensitive learning; noise handling		Recent research in machine learning, data mining, and related areas has produced a wide variety of algorithms for cost-sensitive (CS) classification, where instead of maximizing the classification accuracy, minimizing the misclassification cost becomes the objective. These methods often assume that their input is quality data without conflict or erroneous values, or the noise impact is trivial, which is seldom the case in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a Cost-guided Iterative Classification Filter (CICF) to identify noise for effective CS learning. Instead of putting equal weights on handling noise in all classes in existing efforts, CICF puts more emphasis on expensive classes, which makes it attractive in dealing with data sets with a large cost-ratio. Experimental results and comparative studies indicate that the existence of noise may seriously corrupt the performance of the underlying CS learners and by adopting the proposed CICF algorithm, we can significantly reduce the misclassification cost of a CS classifier in noisy environments.

J	van der Schaar, M; Turaga, DS; Wong, R				van der Schaar, Mihaela; Turaga, Deepak S.; Wong, Raymond			Classification-based system for cross-layer optimized wireless video transmission	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						classification for delay-constrained video transmission; cross-layer optimization	NETWORKS; H.264/AVC	Joint optimization strategies across various layers of the protocol stack have recently been proposed for improving the performance of real-time video transmission over wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a new, low complexity system for determining the optimal cross-layer strategies for wireless multimedia transmission based on classification and machine learning techniques. We first determine offline the optimal cross-layer strategy for various video sequences and channel conditions (training data). Subsequently, we extract relevant and easy to compute content features, encoder-specific parameters, and channel resources from the training data, and train a statistical classifier based on these optimal results. At run-time, we predict using the classifier the optimal cross-layer compression and transmission strategy using these simple, on-the-fly computed features. Hence, we consider the complex problem of finding the optimal cross-layer strategy during the training phase only, and rely at transmission-time on low-complexity classification techniques. We illustrate the proposed classification-based system by performing MAC-application layer optimizations for video transmission over 802.11a wireless LANs. Specifically, we predict the optimal MAC retry limits for the various video packets and compare our results against both optimal and conventionally used ad-hoc cross-layer solutions. Our results indicate that considerable improvements can be obtained through the proposed cross-layer techniques relying on classification as opposed to optimized ad-hoc solutions. The improvements are especially important at high packet-loss rates (5% and higher), where deploying a judicious mixture of strategies at the various layers becomes essential. Furthermore, our proposed classification-based system can be easily modified to include other layers from the OSI stack during the cross-layer optimization.

J	Zhou, YM; Leung, HT				Zhou, Yuming; Leung, Hareton			Empirical analysis of object-oriented design metrics for predicting high and low severity faults	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						object-oriented; faults; fault-proneness; metrics; prediction; cross validation	SOFTWARE QUALITY; PRONENESS MODELS; SYSTEMS; VALIDATION	In the last decade, empirical studies on object-oriented design metrics have shown some of them to be useful for predicting the fault-proneness of classes in object-oriented software systems. This research did not, however, distinguish among faults according to the severity of impact. It would be valuable to know how object-oriented design metrics and class fault-proneness are related when fault severity is taken into account. In this paper, we use logistic regression and machine learning methods to empirically investigate the usefulness of object-oriented design metrics, specifically, a subset of the Chidamber and Kemerer suite, in predicting fault-proneness when taking fault severity into account. Our results, based on a public domain NASA data set, indicate that 1) most of these design metrics are statistically related to fault-proneness of classes across fault severity, and 2) the prediction capabilities of the investigated metrics greatly depend on the severity of faults. More specifically, these design metrics are able to predict low severity faults in fault-prone classes better than high severity faults in fault-prone classes.

It is very challenging, however, to process a large amount of information in a limited time in order to make decisions about the health of the processes and products. This paper develops a "preprocessing" procedure for multiple sets of complicated functional data in order to reduce the data size for supporting timely decision analyses. The data type studied has been used for fault detection, root-cause analysis, and quality improvement in such engineering applications as automobile and semiconductor manufacturing and nanomachining processes. The proposed vertical-energy-thresholding (VET) procedure balances the reconstruction error against data-reduction efficiency so that it is effective in capturing key patterns in the multiple data signals. The selected wavelet coefficients are treated as the "reduced-size" data in subsequent analyses for decision making. This enhances the ability of the existing statistical and machine-learning procedures to handle high-dimensional functional data. A few real.-life examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed procedure compared to several ad hoe techniques extended from single-curve-based data modeling and denoising procedures.

J	Blurock, ES				Blurock, Edward S.			Automatic characterization of ignition processes with machine learning clustering techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL KINETICS			English	Article							OXIDATION	Machine learning clustering techniques are used to characterize and, after the training phase, to identify phases within an ignition process. Forth e ethanol mechanism used in this paper, four physically identifiable phases were found and characterized: the initiation phase, preignition phase, ignition phase, and the postignition phase. The clustering is done with respect to fuzzy logic predicates identifying the maxima, minima, and inflection points of the species profiles. The cluster descriptions characterize the phases found and are in human interpretable form. in addition, these descriptions are powerful enough to be used to predict the phase structure under new conditions. Cluster phases were calculated for the ethanol mechanism at an equivalence ratio of 0.5, a pressure of 3.3 bar, and the temperatures 1200, 1300, 1400, and 1500 K. The resulting cluster phase descriptions were then successfully used to predict the phase structure and ignition delay times for other temperatures in the range from 1200 to 1500 K. The effect of different fuzzy logic predicate profile descriptions is studied to emphasize that the boundaries of some phases, specifically that between the preignition and the ignition phase, are a matter of what the modeler considers important. The end of the ignition phase corresponds to the ignition delay time and was relatively independent of the predicate descriptions used to determine the phases. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Developing this potential, however, presents significant challenges to geographic information science. Modelling the spatio-temporal behaviour of individuals requires new representational forms that capture how organisms store and use spatial information. New procedures must be developed that simulate how individuals produce bounded knowledge of geographical space through experiential learning, adapt this knowledge to continually changing environments, and apply it to spatial decision-making processes. In this paper, we present a framework for the representation of adaptive, spatially aware, and mobile agents. To provide context to this research, a multiagent model is constructed to simulate the migratory behaviour of elk (Cervus elaphus) on Yellowstone's northern range. In this simulated environment, intelligent agents learn in ways that enable them to mimic real-world behaviours and adapt to changing landscapes.

This task can be viewed as a single-label multi-class text categorization problem. Given that the style of a text can be represented as mere word frequencies selected in a language-independent method, suitable machine learning techniques able to deal with high dimensional feature spaces and sparse data can be directly applied to solve this problem. This paper focuses on classifier ensembles based on feature set subspacing. It is shown that an effective ensemble can be constructed using, exhaustive disjoint subspacing, a simple method producing many poor but diverse base classifiers. The simple model can be enhanced by a variation of the technique of cross-validated committees applied to the feature set. Experiments on two benchmark text corpora demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method improving previously reported results and compare it to support vector machines, an alternative suitable machine learning approach to authorship attribution.

Achieving a secure web application involves tackling several issues such encryption of traffic and certain database information, strictly restricted access control, etc. In this work we focus on detecting misuse of the web application in order to gain unauthorised access. We introduce an Intrusion Detection component that by applying Text Categorisation is capable of learning the characteristics of both normal and malicious user behaviour from the regular, high-level log entries generated by web application through its application server. Therefore, the detection of misuse in the web application is achieved without the need of explicit programming or modification of the existing web application. We applied our Intrusion Detection component to a real web-based telemedicine system in order to offer some evaluation measurements. This articles offers an overview of the model, our experiences, and observations.

Automatic analysis of medical dialogue in the home hemodialysis domain: Structure induction and summarization	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						spoken dialogue analysis; medical discourse; summarization; natural language processing; information processing		Spoken medical dialogue is a valuable source of information for patients and caregivers. This work presents a first step towards automatic analysis and summarization of spoken medical dialogue. We first abstract a dialogue into a sequence of semantic categories using linguistic and contextual features integrated in a supervised machine-learning framework. Our model has a classification accuracy of 73%, compared to 33% achieved by a majority baseline (p < 0.01). We then describe and implement a summarizer that utilizes this automatically induced structure. Our evaluation results indicate that automatically generated summaries exhibit high resemblance to summaries written by humans. In addition, task-based evaluation shows that physicians can reasonably answer questions related to patient care by looking at the automatically generated summaries alone, in contrast to the physicians' performance when they were given summaries from a naive summarizer (p < 0.05). This work demonstrates the feasibility of automatically structuring and summarizing spoken medical dialogue. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Menconi, G; Marangoni, R				Menconi, Giulia; Marangoni, Roberto			A compression-based approach for coding sequences identification. I. Application to prokaryotic genomes	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						data compression; coding sequences; non-parametric identification; prokaryotes	MICROBIAL GENE IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; DNA; RECOGNITION; ACCURACY; ARCHAEON	Most of the gene prediction algorithms for prokaryotes are based on Hidden Markov Models or similar machine-learning approaches, which imply the optimization of a high number of parameters. The present paper presents a novel method for the classification of coding and non-coding regions in prokaryotic genomes, based on a suitably defined compression index of a DNA sequence. The main features of this new method are the non-parametric logic and the costruction of a dictionary of words extracted from the sequences. These dictionaries can be very useful to perform further analyses on the genomic sequences themselves. The proposed approach has been applied on some prokaryotic complete genomes, obtaining optimal scores of correctly recognized coding and non-coding regions. Several false-positive and false-negative cases have been investigated in detail, which have revealed that this approach can fail in the presence of highly structured coding regions (e.g., genes coding for modular proteins) or quasi-random non-coding regions (e.g., regions hosting non-functional fragments of copies of functional genes; regions hosting promoters or other protein-binding sequences). We perform an overall comparison with other gene-finder software, since at this step we are not interested in building another gene-finder system, but only in exploring the possibility of the suggested approach.

It aims at eliminating the pitfalls and disadvantages of the techniques and algorithms currently in use. The proposed algorithm makes use of the direct rule extraction approach, rather than the decision tree. For this purpose, it uses a set of examples to induce general rules. Using some widely used set of examples such as IRIS, Balance and Balloons, Monk, Splice, Promoter, Lenses, Zoo, and Vote, our algorithm is compared with other well-known algorithms such as ID3, C4.5, ILA, and Rules Family.

Such inconsistencies can be the result of modeling errors or recent modifications of the system. Despite such discrepancies, we can still attempt to perform automatic verification. In fact, as we show, we can sometimes exploit the verification results to assist in automatically learning the required updates to the model. In a related previous work, we have suggested the idea of black box checking, where verification starts without any model, and the model is obtained while repeated verification attempts are performed. Under the current assumptions, an existing inaccurate (but not completely obsolete) model is used to expedite the updates. We use techniques from black box testing and machine learning. We present an implementation of the proposed methodology called AMC (for Adaptive Model Checking). We discuss some experimental results, comparing various tactics of updating a model while trying to perform model checking.

Cost curves: An improved method for visualizing classifier performance	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						performance evaluation; classifiers; ROC curves; machine learning	OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES; CHARACTERISTIC ROC CURVES; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; DIAGNOSTIC-TEST; INDUCTION; ACCURACY; SYSTEMS; TESTS; BANDS	This paper introduces cost curves, a graphical technique for visualizing the performance (error rate or expected cost) of 2-class classifiers over the full range of possible class distributions and misclassification costs. Cost curves are shown to be superior to ROC curves for visualizing classifier performance for most purposes. This is because they visually support several crucial types of performance assessment that cannot be done easily with ROC curves, such as showing confidence intervals on a classifier's performance, and visualizing the statistical significance of the difference in performance of two classifiers. A software tool supporting all the cost curve analysis described in this paper is available from the authors.

J	Boulle, M				Boulle, Marc			MODL: A Bayes optimal discretization method for continuous attributes	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; discretization; Bayesianism; data analysis		While real data often comes in mixed format, discrete and continuous, many supervised induction algorithms require discrete data. Efficient discretization of continuous attributes is an important problem that has effects on speed, accuracy and understandability of the induction models. In this paper, we propose a new discretization method MODL1, founded on a Bayesian approach. We introduce a space of discretization models and a prior distribution defined on this model space. This results in the definition of a Bayes optimal evaluation criterion of discretizations. We then propose a new super-linear optimization algorithm that manages to find near-optimal discretizations. Extensive comparative experiments both on real and synthetic data demonstrate the high inductive performances obtained by the new discretization method.

J	Toh, KA				Toh, Kar-Ann			Training a reciprocal-sigmoid classifier by feature scaling-space	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						machine learning; pattern classification; Phi-machine; polynomials; parameter estimation	RELEVANCE VECTOR MACHINE; FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; NOISE INJECTION; LINEAR-MODELS	This paper presents a reciprocal-sigmoid model for pattern classification. This proposed classifier can be considered as a Phi-machine since it preserves the theoretical advantage of linear machines where the weight parameters can be estimated in a single step. The model can also be considered as an approximation to logistic regression under the framework of Generalized Linear Models. While inheriting the necessary classification capability from logistic regression, the problems of local minima and tedious recursive search no longer exist in the proposed formulation. To handle possible over-fitting when using high order models, the classifier is trained using multiple samples of uniformly scaled pattern features. Empirically, the classifier is evaluated using a benchmark synthetic data from random sampling runs for initial statistical evidence regarding its classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Additional experiments based on ten runs of 10-fold cross validations on 40 data sets further support the effectiveness of the reciprocal-sigmoid model, where its classification accuracy is seen to be comparable to several top classifiers in the literature. Main reasons for the good performance are attributed to effective use of reciprocal sigmoid for embedding nonlinearities and effective use of bundled feature sets for smoothing the training error hyper-surface.

J	Nanni, L; Lumini, A				Nanni, Loris; Lumini, Alessandra			Empirical tests on BioHashing	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						multi-modal matcher; machine learning; classifier combination	VERIFICATION; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; SYSTEM; IRIS	Given the recent explosion of interest in human authentication, verification based on tokenised pseudo-random numbers and user-specific biometric feature (BioHashing) has received much attention. The purpose of our paper is to investigate the pros and the cons of BioHashing. In particular we study: how to combine BioHashing in a multi-modal fusion approach based on the integration of face and fingerprint data; how to combine BioHashing and user specific Iris features. The results of this paper confirm that a multi-modal biometric can overcome some of the limitations of a single biometric resulting in a substantial performance improvement. Moreover, we show that a multi-matcher system based on the fusion between "BioHashed" Iris features and a "standard" Iris matcher permits to obtain good performance when an "impostor" steals the pseudo-random numbers, and a near zero Equal Error Rate when nobody steals the pseudo-random numbers.

The proposed scheme creates an appropriate polynomial equation with weighted coefficients as an objective function for fitness evaluation. The coefficients of the proposed polynomial equation represent the anomaly score of each field. After the evolutionary process is complete, the selected features are used for preprocessing TCP/IP packets before applying TCP/IP packets directly into anomalous detection.

An automatic and efficient prediction method for the protein subcellular localization is highly required owing to the need for large-scale genome analysis. From a machine learning point of view, a dataset of protein localization has several characteristics: the dataset has too many classes (there are more than 10 localizations in a cell), it is a multi-label dataset (a protein may occur in several different subcellular locations), and it is too imbalanced (the number of proteins in each localization is remarkably different). Even though many previous works have been done for the prediction of protein subcellular localization, none of them tackles effectively these characteristics at the same time. Thus, a new computational method for protein localization is eventually needed for more reliable outcomes. To address the issue, we present a protein localization predictor based on D-SVDD (PLPD) for the prediction of protein localization, which can find the likelihood of a specific localization of a protein more easily and more correctly. Moreover, we introduce three measurements for the more precise evaluation of a protein localization predictor. As the results of various datasets which are made from the experiments of Huh et al. (2003), the proposed PLPD method represents a different approach that might play a complimentary role to the existing methods, such as Nearest Neighbor method and discriminate covariant method. Finally, after finding a good boundary for each localization using the 5184 classified proteins as training data, we predicted 138 proteins whose subcellular localizations could not be clearly observed by the experiments of Huh et al. (2003).

J	Lumini, A; Nanni, L				Lumini, Alessandra; Nanni, Loris			Machine learning for HIV-1 protease cleavage site prediction	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						HIV-1 protease; Karhunen-Loeve transform; hierarchical approach	PROTEINS; VIRUS	Recently, several works have approached the HIV-1 protease specificity problem by applying a number of classifier creation and combination methods, known as ensemble methods, from the field of machine learning. However, it is still difficult for researchers to choose the best method due to the lack of an effective comparison. For the first time we have made an extensive study on methods for feature extraction, feature transformation and multiclassifier systems (MCS) in the problem of HIV-1 protease. In this work we report an experimental comparison on several learning systems coupled with different feature representations. We confirm previous results stating that linear classifiers obtain higher performance than non-linear classifiers using orthonormal encoding, but we also show that using Karhunen-Loeve transform the performance of neural networks are comparable to one of linear support vector machines. Finally we propose a new hierarchical approach that, for the first time, combines ideas derived from the machine learning methodologies and from a knowledge base of this particular problem. This approach proves to be a successful attempt to obtain a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of linear classifiers: the error rate decreases from 9.1% using linear-SVM to 6.6% using our new hierarchical classifier based on some pattern rules.

The current manuscript explores newtoxicogenomics approaches to better understand the hepatotoxic potential of human pharmaceutical compounds and to assess their toxicity earlier in the drug development process by means of a toxicity screen. Resources: Data consisted of two commercial knowledgebases that employed a hybrid experimental design in which human drug toxicity information was extracted from the literature, dichotomized and merged with rat-based gene expression measures. One knowledgebase used gene expression from rat primary hepatocytes while the other employed whole rats. Approximately 100 compounds were used in each. Methods: Toxicity classification rules were built using a stochastic gradient boosting machine learner, with classification error estimated using a modified bootstrap estimate of true error. Several types of clustering methods were also applied, some based on sets of compounds and others based on sets of genes. Results: Robust classification rules were constructed for both in vitro (hepatocytes) and in vivo (liver) data, based on a high dose, 24-hour design. There appeared to be little overlap between the two classifiers, at least in terms of their gene lists. Robust classifiers could not be fitted when earlier timepoints and/or low dose data were included, indicating that experimental design is important for these systems. Conclusions: In light of these findings, a working compound screen based on these toxicity classifiers appears feasible, with classifier operating characteristics used to tune a screen for a specific implementation. To ensure robust and optimal performance, issues such as site variability of microarrays and generalizability of findings should be addressed as indicated.

The cellular location and functional diversity of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (omps) makes them an important protein class. At the present time, very few nonhomologous TMB structures have been determined by X-ray diffraction because of the experimental difficulty encountered in crystallizing transmembrane proteins. A novel method using pairwise interstrand residue statistical potentials derived from globular (nonouter membrane) proteins is introduced to predict the supersecondary structure of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins. The algorithm transFold employs a generalized hidden Markov model (i.e., multitape S-attribute grammar) to describe potential beta-barrel supersecondary structures and then computes by dynamic programming the minimum free energy beta-barrel structure. Hence, the approach can be viewed as a "wrapping" component that may capture folding processes with an initiation stage followed by progressive interaction of the sequence with the already-formed motifs. This approach differs significantly from others, which use traditional machine learning to solve this problem, because it does not require a training phase on known TMB structures and is the first to explicitly capture and predict long-range interactions. TransFold outperforms previous programs for predicting TMBs on smaller (5200 residues) proteins and matches their performance for straightforward recognition of longer proteins. An exception is for multimeric porins where the algorithm does perform well when an important functional motif in loops is initially identified. We verify our simulations of the folding process by comparing them with experimental data on the functional folding of TMBs. A Web server running transFold is available and outputs contact predictions and locations for sequences predicted to form TMBs.

J	Huang, L; Su, CY				Huang, Li; Su, Congyong			Facial expression synthesis using manifold learning and belief propagation	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						facial expression synthesis; regularization network; manifold learning; belief propagation	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; IMAGES	Given a person's neutral face, we can predict his/her unseen expression by machine learning techniques for image processing. Different from the prior expression cloning or image analogy approaches, we try to hallucinate the person's plausible facial expression with the help of a large face expression database. In the first step, regularization network based nonlinear manifold learning is used to obtain a smooth estimation for unseen facial expression, which is better than the reconstruction results of PCA. In the second step, Markov network is adopted to learn the low-level local facial feature's relationship between the residual neutral and the expressional face image's patches in the training set, then belief propagation is employed to infer the expressional residual face image for that person. By integrating the two approaches, we obtain the final results. The experimental results show that the hallucinated facial expression is not only expressive but also close to the ground truth.

Plasticity of functional connectivity in the adult spinal cord	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						spinal cord injury; rehabilitation; robotics; locomotion; standing; neural control systems	CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR; LOCOMOTOR RECOVERY; MOTOR FUNCTION; INJURY; CATS; RAT; COORDINATION; TRANSECTION; MOTONEURONS; MOVEMENTS	This paper emphasizes several characteristics of the neural control of locomotion that provide opportunities for developing strategies to maximize the recovery of postural and locomotor functions after a spinal cord injury (SCI). The major points of this paper are: (i) the circuitry that controls standing and stepping is extremely malleable and reflects a continuously varying combination of neurons that are activated when executing stereotypical movements; (ii) the connectivity between neurons is more accurately perceived as a functional rather than as an anatomical phenomenon; (iii) the functional connectivity that controls standing and stepping reflects the physiological state of a given assembly of synapses, where the probability of these synaptic events is not deterministic; (iv) rather, this probability can be modulated by other factors such as pharmacological agents, epidural stimulation and/or motor training; (v) the variability observed in the kinematics of consecutive steps reflects a fundamental feature of the neural control system and (vi) machine-learning theories elucidate the need to accommodate variability in developing strategies designed to enhance motor performance by motor training using robotic devices after an SCI.

A machine learning strategy to identify candidate binding sites in human protein-coding sequence	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; RNA SPLICING ENHANCERS; SR PROTEIN; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; ELEMENTS; DATABASE; DISTINCT; INTRONS; GENES	Background: The splicing of RNA transcripts is thought to be partly promoted and regulated by sequences embedded within exons. Known sequences include binding sites for SR proteins, which are thought to mediate interactions between splicing factors bound to the 5' and 3' splice sites. It would be useful to identify further candidate sequences, however identifying them computationally is hard since exon sequences are also constrained by their functional role in coding for proteins. Results: This strategy identified a collection of motifs including several previously reported splice enhancer elements. Although only trained on coding exons, the model discriminates both coding and non-coding exons from intragenic sequence. Conclusion: We have trained a computational model able to detect signals in coding exons which seem to be orthogonal to the sequences' primary function of coding for proteins. We believe that many of the motifs detected here represent binding sites for both previously unrecognized proteins which influence RNA splicing as well as other regulatory elements.

J	Wren, JD				Wren, Jonathan D.			A scalable machine-learning approach to recognize chemical names within large text databases	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society	MAR 02-04, 2006	Baton Rouge, LA	MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc			BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; RANKING	Motivation: The use or study of chemical compounds permeates almost every scientific field and in each of them, the amount of textual information is growing rapidly. There is a need to accurately identify chemical names within text for a number of informatics efforts such as database curation, report summarization, tagging of named entities and keywords, or the development/curation of reference databases. Results: A first-order Markov Model (MM) was evaluated for its ability to distinguish chemical names from words, yielding similar to 93% recall in recognizing chemical terms and similar to 99% precision in rejecting non-chemical terms on smaller test sets. However, because total false-positive events increase with the number of words analyzed, the scalability of name recognition was measured by processing 13.1 million MEDLINE records. The method yielded precision ranges from 54.7% to 100%, depending upon the cutoff score used, averaging 82.7% for approximately 1.05 million putative chemical terms extracted. Extracted chemical terms were analyzed to estimate the number of spelling variants per term, which correlated with the total number of times the chemical name appeared in MEDLINE. This variability in term construction was found to affect both information retrieval and term mapping when using PubMed and Ovid.

This method was applied to enhance the database enrichment of in silico drug screening and in silico target protein screening using a protein-compound affinity matrix calculated by a protein-compound docking software. Our assumption was that the protein-compound binding free energy of a compound could be improved by a linear combination of its docking scores with many different proteins. We proposed two approaches to determine the coefficients of the linear combination. The first approach is based on similarity among the proteins, and the second is a machine-learning approach based on the known active compounds. These methods were applied to in silico screening of the active compounds of several target proteins and in silico target protein screening.

Assessing the viability of underground slate mining by combining an expert system with a GIS	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						slate; rock mass classification; underground mining; support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EXPLOITATION; ALGORITHMS; NETWORKS	The slate sector in Galicia (NW Spain) is facing a growing crisis resulting from the gradual increase in the exploitation ratios for open quarries and increasingly stringent environmental restrictions. Given that good geotechnical quality reduces the costs of any underground mining operation, and - for slate and other ornamental rock - conditions the possibility of extracting blocks of a size acceptable to roofing slate transformation and finishing plants, we created a geotechnical quality index, aimed specifically at analysing slate masses, that applied techniques from the machine learning field (Support Vector Machines). This geotechnical quality index, together with the factors that affect underground mining operations, was integrated in a Geographical Information System, which would enable all relevant information on a slate mass to be viewed and analysed simultaneously.

While research in operations research, direct marketing and machine learning focuses on the analysis and design of data mining algorithms, the interaction of data mining with the preceding phase of data preprocessing has not been investigated in detail. This paper investigates the influence of different preprocessing techniques of attribute scaling, sampling, coding of categorical as well as coding of continuous attributes on the classifier performance of decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. The impact of different preprocessing choices is assessed on a real world dataset from direct marketing using a multifactorial analysis of variance on various performance metrics and method parameterisations. Our case-based analysis provides empirical evidence that data preprocessing has a significant impact on predictive accuracy, with certain schemes proving inferior to competitive approaches. In addition, it is found that (1) selected methods prove almost as sensitive to different data representations as to method parameterisations, indicating the potential for increased performance through effective preprocessing; (2) the impact of preprocessing schemes varies by method, indicating different 'best practice' setups to facilitate superior results of a particular method; (3) algorithmic sensitivity towards preprocessing is consequently an important criterion in method evaluation and selection which needs to be considered together with traditional metrics of predictive power and computational efficiency in predictive data mining.

Methods We obtained serum proteomic profiles from patients with active tuberculosis and controls by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry. A supervised machine-learning approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) was used to obtain a classifier that distinguished between the groups in two independent test sets. We used k-fold cross validation and random sampling of the SVM classifier to assess the classifier further. Relevant mass peaks were selected by correlational analysis and assessed with SVM We tested the diagnostic potential of candidate biomarkers, identified by peptide mass fingerprinting, by conventional immunoassays and SVM classifiers trained on these data. Findings Our SVM classifier discriminated the proteomic profile of patients with active tuberculosis from that of controls with overlapping clinical features. Diagnostic accuracy was 94% (sensitivity 93.5%, specificity 94.9%) for patients with tuberculosis and was unaffected by HIV status. A classifier trained on the 20 most informative peaks achieved diagnostic accuracy of 90%. From these peaks, two peptides (serum amyloid A protein and transthyretin) were identified and quantitated by immunoassay. Because these peptides reflect inflammatory states, we also quantitated neopterin and C reactive protein. Application of an SVM classifier using combinations of these values gave diagnostic accuracies of up to 84% for tuberculosis. Validation on a second, prospectively collected testing set gave similar accuracies using the whole proteomic signature and the 20 selected peaks. Using combinations of the four biomarkers, we achieved diagnostic accuracies of up to 78%. Interpretation The potential biomarkers for tuberculosis that we identified through proteomic fingerprinting and pattern recognition have a plausible biological connection with the disease and could be used to develop new diagnostic tests.

J	Kusiak, A				Kusiak, A.			Data mining: manufacturing and service applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						data mining; decision making; knowledge structuring; process modelling; industrial applications	DRIVEN CONSTRUCTIVE INDUCTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SELECTION	In this paper basic concepts of machine learning and data mining are introduced. Machine learning algorithms extract knowledge from diverse data bases that can be used to build decision-making systems. For example, based on the operational engineering data, equipment faults can be detected, the number of items to be ordered can be predicted, optimal control parameters can be determined. A framework for organizing and applying knowledge for decision-making in manufacturing and service applications is presented. The framework uses decision-making constructs such decision tables, decision maps, and atlases. It offers a new data-driven paradigm of importance to modern manufacturing and service organisations. Examples of data mining applications in industrial, medical, and pharmaceutical domains are presented. It is envisioned that the data-driven framework presented in the paper will enhance these applications.

The challenges associated with the analysis of large-scale multivariate proteomic datasets have been widely discussed in medical research and biomarker discovery. This concept has been introduced to ecotoxicology only recently, so data processing and classification analysis need to be refined before they can be readily applied in biomarker discovery and monitoring studies. Results: Data sets obtained from a case study of oil pollution in the Blue mussel were investigated for differential protein expression by retentate chromatography-mass spectrometry and decision tree classification. Different tissues and different settings were used to evaluate classifiers towards their discriminatory power. It was found that, due the intrinsic variability of the data sets, reliable classification of unknown samples could only be achieved on a broad statistical basis (n > 60) with the observed expression changes comprising high statistical significance and sufficient amplitude. The application of stringent criteria to guard against overfitting of the models eventually allowed satisfactory classification for only one of the investigated data sets and settings. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques provide a promising approach to process and extract informative expression signatures from high-dimensional mass-spectrometry data. Even though characterisation of the proteins forming the expression signatures would be ideal, knowledge of the specific proteins is not mandatory for effective class discrimination. This may constitute a new biomarker approach in ecotoxicology, where working with organisms, which do not have sequenced genomes render protein identification by database searching problematic.

Predicting the effect of missense mutations on protein function: analysis with Bayesian networks	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; AMINO-ACID POLYMORPHISMS; BACTERIOPHAGE-T4 LYSOZYME; LAC REPRESSOR; SNPS; SUBSTITUTIONS; CONSEQUENCES; SEQUENCE; DISEASE	Background: A number of methods that use both protein structural and evolutionary information are available to predict the functional consequences of missense mutations. However, many of these methods break down if either one of the two types of data are missing. Furthermore, there is a lack of rigorous assessment of how important the different factors are to prediction. Results: Here we use Bayesian networks to predict whether or not a missense mutation will affect the function of the protein. Bayesian networks provide a concise representation for inferring models from data, and are known to generalise well to new data. More importantly, they can handle the noisy, incomplete and uncertain nature of biological data. Our Bayesian network achieved comparable performance with previous machine learning methods. The predictive performance of learned model structures was no better than a naive Bayes classifier. However, analysis of the posterior distribution of model structures allows biologically meaningful interpretation of relationships between the input variables. Conclusion: The ability of the Bayesian network to make predictions when only structural or evolutionary data was observed allowed us to conclude that structural information is a significantly better predictor of the functional consequences of a missense mutation than evolutionary information, for the dataset used. Analysis of the posterior distribution of model structures revealed that the top three strongest connections with the class node all involved structural nodes. With this in mind, we derived a simplified Bayesian network that used just these three structural descriptors, with comparable performance to that of an all node network.

J	Kinjo, AR; Nishikawa, K				Kinjo, Akira R.; Nishikawa, Ken			CRNPRED: highly accurate prediction of one-dimensional protein structures by large-scale critical random networks	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; MATRICES; DATABASE; RECOGNITION; NUMBER; SERVER	Background: One-dimensional protein structures such as secondary structures or contact numbers are useful for three-dimensional structure prediction and helpful for intuitive understanding of the sequence-structure relationship. Accurate prediction methods will serve as a basis for these and other purposes. Results: We implemented a program CRNPRED which predicts secondary structures, contact numbers and residue-wise contact orders. This program is based on a novel machine learning scheme called critical random networks. Unlike most conventional one-dimensional structure prediction methods which are based on local windows of an amino acid sequence, CRNPRED takes into account the whole sequence. CRNPRED achieves, on average per chain, Q(3) = 81% for secondary structure prediction, and correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.61 for contact number and residue-wise contact order predictions, respectively. Conclusion: CRNPRED will be a useful tool for computational as well as experimental biologists who need accurate one-dimensional protein structure predictions.

However, some other constraints are difficult to represent, like comfort or user satisfaction. Partially defined constraints can be used to model the incomplete knowledge of a concept or a relation. Instead of only computing with the known part of the constraint, we propose to complete its definition by using machine-learning techniques. Because constraints are actively used during solving for pruning domains, building a classifier for instances is not enough: we need a solver able to reduce variable domains. Our technique is composed of two steps: first we learn a classifier for the constraint's projections and then we transform the classifier into a propagator. We show that our technique not only has good learning performances but also yields a very efficient solver for the learned constraint.

J	Furtado, V; Vasconcelos, E				Furtado, Vasco; Vasconcelos, Eurico			A multiagent simulator for teaching police allocation	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction	MAR 02-04, 2006	Salt Lake City, UT					This article describes the,ExpertCop tutorial system, a simulator of crime in an urban region. In ExpertCop, the students (police officers) configure and allocate an available police force according to a selected geographic region and then interact with the simulation. The student interprets the results with the help of an intelligent tutor, the pedagogical agent, observing how crime behaves in the presence of the allocated preventive policing. The interaction between domain agents representing social entities as criminals and police teams drives the simulation. ExpertCop induces students to reflect on resource allocation. The pedagogical agent implements interaction strategies between the student and the geosimblator, designed to make simulated phenomena better understood. In particular, the agent uses a machine-learning algorithm to identify patterns in simulation data and to formulate questions to the student about these patterns.

Agreement and repeatability for standard automated perimetry and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy in the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							HEIDELBERG RETINA TOMOGRAPH; TEST-RETEST VARIABILITY; OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA; VISUAL-FIELD LOSS; OCULAR HYPERTENSION TREATMENT; MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS; OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPH; FIBER LAYER THICKNESS; TOPOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS; CONVENTIONAL PERIMETRY	center dot PURPOSE: To assess agreement between structural and functional testing in classifying eyes as normal or abnormal and their repeatability on two consecutive visits by means of standard automated perimetry (SAP) and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. center dot DESIGN: Analysis of selected data obtained from a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study. center dot METHODS: One hundred fifty,one participants with a SAP and a Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) test within a three,month window at two visits within 15 months were included. Eyes were classified by SAP and HRT at each visit. Agreement and repeatability were assessed by kappa statistics. center dot RESULTS: At visit 1, 33 (22%) of 151 eyes had only SAP defects, 11 (7%) eyes had only HRT defects, and 35 (23%) eyes had both SAP and HRT defects. Seventy-two eyes (48%) were classified as normal by both tests. Similar results were obtained for visit 2. The agreement between SAP and HRT in classifying eyes was 70% (kappa = 0.393) at visit one and 68% (kappa = 0.363) at visit 2. Repeatability of classification by SAP alone, HRT alone, and both SAP and HRT between visits 1 and 2 was 84% (kappa = 0.693), 89% (kappa = 0.752), and 90% (kappa = 0.723), respectively. center dot CONCLUSIONS: Agreement between SAP and HRT was only fair at both visits. Repeatability across visits was substantial for SAP alone, HRT alone, and for the combination of SAP and HRT. These results suggest that detection of particular features of glaucomatous damage depends on the technique used. Structural and functional tests appear complementary, and both should be used for early detection of glaucoma.

However, to date, no one approach has been shown to accurately identify the origins of fecal pollution in aquatic environments. In this multilaboratory study, different microbial and chemical indicators were analyzed in order to distinguish human fecal sources from nonhuman fecal sources using wastewaters and slurries from diverse geographical areas within Europe. Twenty-six parameters, which were later combined to form derived variables for statistical analyses, were obtained by performing methods that were achievable in all the participant laboratories: enumeration of fecal coliform bacteria, enterococci, clostridia, somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA phages, bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis RYC2056 and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GA17, and total and sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria; genotyping of F-specific RNA phages; biochemical phenotyping of fecal coliform bacteria and enterococci using miniaturized tests; specific detection of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium dentium; and measurement of four fecal sterols. A number of potentially useful source indicators were detected (bacteriophages infecting B. thetaiotaomicron, certain genotypes of F-specific bacteriophages, sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and epycoprostanol), although no one source identifier alone provided 100% correct classification of the fecal source. Subsequently, 38 variables (both single and derived) were defined from the measured microbial and chemical parameters in order to find the best subset of variables to develop predictive models using the lowest possible number of measured parameters. To this end, several statistical or machine learning methods were evaluated and provided two successful predictive models based on just two variables, giving 100% correct classification: the ratio of the densities of somatic coliphages and phages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of somatic coliphages and the ratio of the densities of fecal coliform bacteria and phages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of fecal coliform bacteria. Other models with high rates of correct classification were developed, but in these cases, higher numbers of variables were required.

Q(2) learning and its application to car modelling	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION	In this paper we describe an application of Q(2) learning, a recently developed approach to machine learning in numerical domains (Suc et al., 2003, 2004) to the automated modelling of a complex, industrially relevant mechanical system - a four wheel suspension and steering system of a car. In this experiment, first a qualitative model of this dynamic system was induced from data, and then this model was reified into a quantitative model. The induced qualitative models enable explanation of relations among the variables in the system and, when reified into quantitative models, enable accurate numerical prediction. Furthermore, the qualitative guidance of the quantitative modelling process leads to predictions that are significantly more accurate than those obtained by state-of-the-art numerical learning methods.

In this work, we have analyzed the influence of physico-chemical, energetic and conformational properties of amino acid residues for discriminating outer membrane proteins using different machine learning algorithms, such as, Bayes rules, Logistic functions, Neural networks, Support vector machines, Decision trees, etc. We observed that most of the properties have discriminated the OMPs with similar accuracy. The neural network method with the property, free energy change could discriminate the OMPs from other folding types of globular and membrane proteins at the 5-fold cross-validation accuracy of 94.4% in a dataset of 1088 proteins, which is better than that obtained with amino acid composition. The accuracy of discriminating globular proteins is 94.3% and that of transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins is 91.8%. Further, the neural network method is tested with globular proteins belonging to 30 major folding types and it could successfully exclude 99.4% of the considered 1612 non-redundant proteins. These accuracy levels are comparable to or better than other methods in the literature. We suggest that this method could be effectively used to discriminate OMPs and for detecting OMPs in genomic sequences. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, Y; Kim, Y; Lee, S; Koo, JY				Lee, Yoonkyung; Kim, Yuwon; Lee, Sangjun; Koo, Ja-Yong			Structured multicategory support vector machines with analysis of variance decomposition	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						classification; feature selection; linear programming; l(1)-norm penalty; quadratic programming; regularisation method; reproducing kernel Hilbert space	CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; REGULARIZATION; REGRESSION; NETWORKS	The support vector machine has been a popular choice of classification method for many applications in machine learning. While it often outperforms other methods in terms of classification accuracy, the implicit nature of its solution renders the support vector machine less attractive in providing insights into the relationship between covariates and classes. Use of structured kernels can remedy the drawback. Borrowing the flexible model-building idea of functional analysis of variance decomposition, we consider multicategory support vector machines with analysis of variance kernels in this paper. An additional penalty is imposed on the sum of weights of functional subspaces, which encourages a sparse representation of the solution. Incorporation of the additional penalty enhances the interpretability of a resulting classifier with often improved accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to real data.

J	Kam, J; Dick, S				Kam, Jeffery; Dick, Scott			Comparing nearest-neighbour search strategies in the SMOTE algorithm	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING-REVUE CANADIENNE DE GENIE ELECTRIQUE ET INFORMATIQUE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th Annual Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	MAY 07-10, 2006	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE		classification; data mining; machine learning; nearest-neighbour; oversampling; performance testing; resampling; skewness		Nearest-neighbour searches are a key element of the new SMOTE algorithm for resampling highly skewed datasets for machine learning. However, at present no work has been done to determine the most efficient and scalable neighbour search to use in the SMOTE algorithm. This question will be a key consideration if SMOTE is to be deployed in extremely large, highly skewed datasets. This paper reports on empirical investigations of two fast neighbour search strategies, namely, K-D trees and box-assisted neighbour searches. The times required to oversample three well-known datasets with SMOTE using these two strategies are compared to each other as well as to the time required for a brute-force sequential search strategy. In general, an order-of-magnitude improvement in execution time is found from sequential search to K-D trees, and a further order-of-magnitude improvement is found from K-D trees to box-assisted search, indicating that the SMOTE algorithm scales best with increasing dataset size when box-assisted search is used. However, it is also observed that SMOTE scales best with an increasing degree of oversampling when K-D trees are used as the neighbour search strategy.

We describe our labeling procedure of various corrections types and statistical analyses of their features in a corpus collected from a train information spoken dialogue system. We then present results of machine-learning experiments designed to identify user corrections of speech recognition errors. We investigate the predictive power of features automatically computable from the prosody of the turn, the speech recognition process, experimental conditions, and the dialogue history.

Toward the end, we design a new l(1)-norm distance metric for measuring misclassification errors and use it to develop a mixed 0-1 integer and linear program (MILP) for the k piecewise linear and convex separation of data. The proposed model is meritorious in that it considers the synergy as well as the individual role of the k hyperplanes in constructing a decision surface and exploits the advances in theory and algorithms and the advent of powerful softwares for MILP for its solution. With artificially created data, we illustrate pros and cons of pattern classification by the proposed methodology. With six benchmark classification datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and competitive with well-established learning methods. In summary, the classifiers constructed by the proposed approach obtain the best prediction rates on three of the six datasets and the second best records for two of the remaining three datasets.

Knowledge management, knowledge discovery, and dynamic intelligent data mining	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article							FUZZY DATA-ANALYSIS	During the last two to three decades, many scientific as well business areas have moved from a situation of a lack of (electronically) readable information into a situation of abundant data. Data warehouses appeared, and the problem of extracting information from large masses of data became more and more important. Also knowledge became a very precious commodity, and its efficient use often makes the difference between success and failure. Finding useful information or patterns in raw data is known in the literature under various names, such as knowledge discovery in data bases, data mining, knowledge extraction, information discovery, information harvesting, data archaeology, etc. Many research areas, such as machine learning, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, knowledge acquisition for expert systems, data visualization, and others are concerned with these activities, and the terminology used is not unequivocally defined. In this article, we shall first consider the different interpretations of the notions previously mentioned, and we shall then describe in more detail a recent technology that is very useful for data mining as well as for related areas.

Its use is, however, made difficult by the large number of possible data projections showing different attribute subsets that must be evaluated by the data analyst. In this paper, we introduce a method called VizRank, which is applied on classified data to automatically select the most useful data projections. VizRank can be used with any visualization method that maps attribute values to points in a two-dimensional visualization space. It assesses possible data projections and ranks them by their ability to visually discriminate between classes. The quality of class separation is estimated by computing the predictive accuracy of k-nearest neighbor classifier on the data set consisting of x and y positions of the projected data points and their class information. The paper introduces the method and presents experimental results which show that VizRank's ranking of projections highly agrees with subjective rankings by data analysts. The practical use of VizRank is also demonstrated by an application in the field of functional genomics.

A new family of proximity graphs: Class cover catch digraphs	DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						class cover problem; pattern classification; machine learning; digraph		Motivated by issues in machine learning and statistical pattern classification, we investigate a class cover problem (CCP) with an associated family of directed graphs-class cover catch digraphs (CCCDs). CCCDs are a special case of catch digraphs. Solving, the underlying CCP is equivalent to finding a smallest cardinality dominating set for the associated CCCD, which in turn provides regularization for statistical pattern classification. Some relevant properties of CCCDs are studied and a characterization of a family of CCCDs is given. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Seringhaus, M; Paccanaro, A; Borneman, A; Snyder, M; Gerstein, M				Seringhaus, Michael; Paccanaro, Alberto; Borneman, Anthony; Snyder, Michael; Gerstein, Mark			Predicting essential genes in fungal genomes	GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article							SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE GENOME; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; EFFECTIVE NUMBER; PROTEIN; YEAST; IDENTIFICATION; BIOINFORMATICS; DELETION; SEARCH	Essential genes are required for an organism's viability, and the ability to identify these genes in pathogens is crucial to directed drug development. Predicting essential genes through computational methods is appealing because it circumvents expensive and difficult experimental screens. Most such prediction is based on homology mapping to experimentally verified essential genes in model organisms. We present here a different approach, one that relies exclusively on sequence features of a gene to estimate essentiality and offers a promising way to identify essential genes in unstudied or uncultured organisms. We identified 14 characteristic sequence features potentially associated with essentiality, such as localization signals, codon adaptation, GC content, and overall hydrophobicity. Using the well- characterized baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we employed a simple Bayesian framework to measure the correlation of each of these features with essentiality. We then employed the 14 features to learn the parameters of a machine learning classifier capable of predicting essential genes. We trained our classifier on known essential genes in S. cerevisiae and applied it to the closely related and relatively unstudied yeast Saccharomyces mikatae. We assessed predictive success in two ways: First, we compared all of our predictions with those generated by homology mapping between these two species. Second, we verified a subset of our predictions with eight in vivo knockouts in S. mikatae, and we present here the first experimentally confirmed essential genes in this species.

Glycation is involved in diabetes and aging where the accumulation of glycation products causes side effects. In this study, we statistically investigate the glycation of epsilon amino groups of lysines and also train a sequence-based predictor. The statistical analysis suggests that acidic amino acids, mainly glutamate, and lysine residues catalyze the glycation of nearby lysines. The catalytic acidic amino acids are found mainly C-terminally from the glycation site, whereas the basic lysine residues are found mainly N-terminally. The predictor was made by combining 60 artificial neural networks in a balloting procedure. The cross-validated Matthews correlation coefficient for the predictor is 0.58, which is quite impressive given the relatively small amount of experimental data available.

The approach is named large margin HMM. First, we show this type of large margin HMM estimation problem can be formulated as a constrained minimax optimization problem. Second, we propose to solve this constrained minimax optimization problem by using a penalized gradient descent algorithm, where the original objective function, i.e., minimum margin, is approximated by a differentiable function and the constraints are cast as penalty terms in the objective function. The new training,method is evaluated in the speaker-independent isolated E-set recognition and the TIDIGITS connected digit string recognition tasks. Experimental results clearly show that the large margin HMMs consistently outperform the conventional HMM training methods. It has been consistently observed that the large margin training method yields significant recognition error rate reduction even on top of some popular 1 discriminative training methods.

A new text categorization technique using distributional clustering and learning logic	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						text categorization; feature selection; machine learning		Text categorization is continuing to be one of the most researched NLP problems due to the ever-increasing amounts of electronic documents and digital libraries. In this paper, we present a new text categorization method that combines the distributional clustering of words and a learning logic technique, called Lsquare, for constructing text classifiers. The high dimensionality of text in a document has not been fruitful for the task of categorization, for which reason, feature clustering has been proven to be an ideal alternative to feature selection for reducing the dimensionality. We, therefore, use distributional clustering method (IB) to generate an efficient representation of documents and apply Lsquare for training text classifiers. The method was extensively tested and evaluated. The proposed method achieves higher or comparable classification accuracy and F(1) results compared with SVM on exact experimental settings with a small number of training documents on three benchmark data sets WebKB, 20Newsgroup, and Reuters21578. The results prove that the method is a good choice for applications with a limited amount of labeled training data. We also demonstrate the effect of changing training size on the classification performance of the learners.

We evaluate the classification task (detecting a several abnormalities separately or simultaneously), classifier paradigm (monolithic or hierarchical), ordering strategy for the training patterns (averaging or voting), training mode (for one epoch, with validation or until completion) and model sensitivity to parameters. We find the fuzzy ARTMAP accurate in accomplishing both tasks; requiring only very few training epochs. Also, selecting a training ordering by voting is more precise than if averaging over orderings. If trained for only one epoch, the fuzzy ARTMAP provides fast, yet stable and accurate learning as well as insensitivity to model complexity. Early stop of training using a validation set reduces the fuzzy ARTMAP complexity as for other machine learning models but cannot improve accuracy beyond that achieved when training is completed. Compared to other machine learning models, the fuzzy ARTMAP does not loose but gain accuracy when overtrained, although increasing its number of categories. Learned incrementally, the fuzzy ARTMAP reaches its ultimate accuracy very fast obtaining most of its data representation capability and accuracy by using only a few examples. Finally, the fuzzy ARTMAP accuracy for this domain is comparable with those of the multilayer perceptron and support vector machine and superior to those of the naive Bayesian and linear classifiers.

Diffusion maps and coarse-graining: A unified framework for dimensionality reduction, graph partitioning, and data set parameterization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; text analysis; knowledge retrieval; quantization; graph-theoretic methods; compression (coding); clustering; clustering similarity measures; information visualization; Markov processes; graph algorithms	GEOMETRIC DIFFUSIONS; STRUCTURE DEFINITION; HARMONIC-ANALYSIS; TOOL	We provide evidence that nonlinear dimensionality reduction, clustering, and data set parameterization can be solved within one and the same framework. The main idea is to define a system of coordinates with an explicit metric that reflects the connectivity of a given data set and that is robust to noise. Our construction, which is based on a Markov random walk on the data, offers a general scheme of simultaneously reorganizing and subsampling graphs and arbitrarily shaped data sets in high dimensions using intrinsic geometry. We show that clustering in embedding spaces is equivalent to compressing operators. The objective of data partitioning and clustering is to coarse-grain the random walk on the data while at the same time preserving a diffusion operator for the intrinsic geometry or connectivity of the data set up to some accuracy. We show that the quantization distortion in diffusion space bounds the error of compression of the operator, thus giving a rigorous justification fork-means clustering in diffusion space and a precise measure of the performance of general clustering algorithms.

Context-based object detection in still images	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						computer vision; machine learning; object recognition	FACE DETECTION; ATTENTION; STATISTICS; SYSTEM; FIELD; MODEL; END	We present a novel dual-stage object-detection method. In the first stage, an object detector based on appropriate visual features is used to find object candidates. In the second stage, the object candidates are assigned a confidence value based on local-contextual information. Our context-based method is called COBA, for COntext BAsed object detection. At a given detection rate COBA is able to lower the false-detection rate. Experiments in which frontal human faces are to be detected show that the number of false positives is lowered by a factor 8.7 at a detection rate of 80% when compared to the current high-performance object detectors. Moreover, COBA is capable of flexibly using other new object-detection algorithms as 'plug-ins' in the second stage. Hence, object detection can be straightforwardly improved by our method a soon as new insights emerge and are available in algorithmic form. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moderate diversity for better cluster ensembles	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						pattern recognition; machine learning; multiple classifiers; cluster ensembles; diversity measures; adjusted Rand index	CLASSIFIER ENSEMBLES; REPRESENTATIONS; ACCURACY	Adjusted Rand index is used to measure diversity in cluster ensembles and a diversity measure is subsequently proposed. Although the measure was found to be related to the quality of the ensemble, this relationship appeared to be non-monotonic. In some cases, ensembles which exhibited a moderate level of diversity gave a more accurate clustering. Based on this, a procedure for building a cluster ensemble of a chosen type is proposed (assuming that an ensemble relies on one or more random parameters): generate a small random population of cluster ensembles, calculate the diversity of each ensemble and select the ensemble corresponding to the median diversity. We demonstrate the advantages of both our measure and procedure on 5 data sets and carry out statistical comparisons involving two diversity measures for cluster ensembles from the recent literature. An experiment with 9 data sets was also carried out to examine how the diversity-based selection procedure fares on ensembles of various sizes. For these experiments the classification accuracy was used as the performance criterion. The results suggest that selection by median diversity is no worse and in some cases is better than building and holding on to one ensemble. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, YH; Li, H; Cao, YB; Teng, L; Meyerzon, D; Zheng, QH				Hu, YH; Li, H; Cao, YB; Teng, L; Meyerzon, D; Zheng, QH			Automatic extraction of titles from general documents using machine learning	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information extraction; metadata extraction; machine learning; search		In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to title extraction from general documents. By general documents, we mean documents that can belong to any one of a number of specific genres, including presentations, book chapters, technical papers, brochures, reports, and letters. Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint, respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents. Precision and recall for title extraction from Word are 0.810 and 0.837, respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from PowerPoint are 0.875 and 0.895, respectively in an experiment on intranet data. Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to other domains, and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to other languages. Moreover, we can significantly improve search ranking results in document retrieval by using the extracted titles. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Asuncion; Aracil, Rafael			Part grasping for automated disassembly	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						decision trees; disassembly; machine learning; robot grasping	MANIPULATION; ALGORITHM	A robot grasp synthesis algorithm for automated disassembly is presented. The goal is to select grasping points in each part to be disassembled so that a previously planned disassembly sequence can be performed holding the parts firmly and avoiding collisions. The algorithm is structured in five steps in order to make it general enough to cope with different robot grippers and different geometrical data (2D or 3D). The system is learning based, and behaviour rules are automatically extracted from grasping examples given by the user, using mainly decision trees and nearest neighbour techniques. Some simulation experiments have been carried out and results with a two fingered robot gripper are presented.

A strong need for high information content and the increasing object-oriented CAM software requires a new information level for preparation and execution tasks in part manufacturing. This paper describes applications of different intelligent methods especially to support distributed technological data management. The problem of current technological databases will be solved with the help of agent technology and machine learning for distributed information on the shopfloor and in planning departments. The authors introduce a combination of agent-based organization and self-learning of feature-based technological information. The prototype includes three components for coordination, data acquisition and preprocessing of technological information to assist human engineers in planning and manufacturing.

In prediction (machine) learning the prediction rule is derived from data consisting of previously solved cases. Most methods for predictive learning were originated many years ago at the dawn of the computer age. Recently two new techniques have emerged that have revitalized the field. These are support vector machines and boosted decision trees. This paper provides an introduction to these two new methods tracing their respective ancestral roots to standard kernel methods and ordinary decision trees.

Simulation of fluid flow in oil reservoirs is usually carried out using large commercially written finite difference simulators solving conservation equations describing the multi-phase flow through the porous reservoir rocks. This paper examines a Bayesian Framework for uncertainty quantification in porous media flows that uses a stochastic sampling algorithm to generate models that match observed data. Machine learning algorithms are used to speed up the identification of regions in parameter space where good matches to observed data can be found. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Feng, D; Jin, H				Feng, Dan; Jin, Hai			Massive storage systems	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						massive storage; SAN; NAS; intelligent storage; storage virtualization; data grid		To accommodate the explosively increasing amount of data in many areas such as scientific computing and e-Business, physical storage devices and control components have been separated from traditional computing systems to become a scalable, intelligent storage subsystem that, when appropriately designed, should provide transparent storage interface, effective data allocation, flexible and efficient storage management, and other impressive features. The design goals and desirable features of such a storage subsystem include high performance, high scalability, high availability, high reliability and high security. Extensive research has been conducted in this field by researchers all over the world, yet many issues still remain open and challenging. This paper studies five different online massive storage systems and one offline storage system that we have developed with the research grant support from China. The storage pool with multiple network-attached RAIDs avoids expensive store-and-forward data copying between the server and storage system, improving data transfer rate by a factor of 2-3 over a traditional disk array. Two types of high performance distributed storage systems for local-area network storage are introduced in the paper. One of them is the Virtual Interface Storage Architecture (VISA) where VI as a communication protocol replaces the TCP/IP protocol in the system. VISA's performance is shown to achieve better than that of IP SAN by designing and implementing the vSCSI (VI-attached SCSI) protocol to support SCSI commands in the VI network. The other is a fault-tolerant parallel virtual file system that is designed and implemented to provide high I/O performance and high reliability. A global distributed storage system for wide-area network storage is discussed in detail in the paper, where a Storage Service Provider is added to provide storage service and plays the role of user agent for the storage system. Object based Storage Systems not only store data but also adopt the attributes and methods of objects that encapsulate the data. The adaptive policy triggering mechanism (APTM), which borrows proven machine learning techniques to improve the scalability of object storage systems, is the embodiment of the idea about smart storage device and facilitates the self-management of massive storage systems. A typical offline massive storage system is used to backup data or store documents, for which the tape virtualization technology is discussed. Finally, a domain-based storage management framework for different types of storage systems is presented in the paper.

This paper studies multi-instance learning from the view of supervised learning. First, by analyzing some representative learning algorithms, this paper shows that multi-instance learners can be derived from supervised learners by shifting their focuses from the discrimination on the instances to the discrimination on the bags. Second, considering that ensemble learning paradigms can effectively enhance supervised learners, this paper proposes to build multi-instance ensembles to solve multi-instance problems. Experiments on a real-world benchmark test show that ensemble learning paradigms can significantly enhance multi-instance learners.

J	Lin, DT				Lin, Daw-Tung			Facial expression classification using PCA and hierarchical radial basis function network	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						intelligent human-computer interaction; facial expression classification; hierarchical radial basis function network; principal component analysis; local features	NEURAL-NETWORKS; RECOGNITION; EIGENFACES; IMAGES	Intelligent human-computer interaction (HCI) integrates versatile tools such as perceptual recognition, machine learning, affective computing, and emotion cognition to enhance the ways humans interact with computers. Facial expression analysis is one of the essential medium of behavior interpretation and emotion modeling. In this paper, we modify and develop a reconstruction method utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform facial expression recognition. A framework of hierarchical radial basis function network (HRBFN) is further proposed to classify facial expressions based on local features extraction by PCA technique from lips and eyes images. It decomposes the acquired data into a small set of characteristic features. The objective of this research is to develop a more efficient approach to discriminate between seven prototypic facial expressions, such as neutral, smile, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, and sadness. A construetive procedure is detailed and the system performance is evaluated on a public database "Japanese Females Facial Expression (JAFFE)." We conclude that local images of lips and eyes can be treated as cues for facial expression. As anticipated, the experimental results demonstrate the potential capabilities of the proposed approach.

A machine learning algorithm based on KCCA is studied for cross-language information retrieval. We apply the algorithm in Japanese-English cross-language information retrieval. The results are quite encouraging and are significantly better than those obtained by other state of the art methods. Computational complexity is an important issue when applying KCCA to large dataset as in information retrieval. We experimentally evaluate several methods to alleviate the problem of applying KCCA to large datasets. We also investigate cross-language document classification using KCCA as well as other methods. Our results show that it is feasible to use a classifier learned in one language to classify the documents in other languages.

Gender and genre variation in weblogs	JOURNAL OF SOCIOLINGUISTICS			English	Article						CMC; gender; genre; style; text classification; variation; weblog	LANGUAGE	A relationship among language, gender, and discourse genre has previously been observed in informal, spoken interaction and formal, written texts. This study investigates the language/gender/genre relationship in weblogs, a popular new mode of computer-mediated communication (CMC). Taking as the dependent variables stylistic features identified in machine learning research and popularized in a Web interface called the Gender Genie, a multivariate analysis was conducted of entries from random weblogs in a sample balanced for author gender and weblog sub-genre (diary or filter). The results show that the diary entries contained more 'female' stylistic features, and the filter entries more 'male' stylistic features, independent of author gender. These findings problematize the characterization of the stylistic features as gendered, and suggest a need for more fine-grained genre analysis in CMC research. At the same time, it is observed that conventional associations of gender with certain spoken and written genres are reproduced in weblogs, along with their societal valuations.

Automating the assignment of diagnosis codes to patient encounters using example-based and machine learning techniques	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							CHIEF COMPLAINTS; LANGUAGE; CLASSIFICATION; RADIOLOGY; SYSTEM	Objective: Human classification of diagnoses is a labor intensive process that consumes significant resources. Most medical practices use specially trained medical coders to categorize diagnoses for billing and research purposes. Methods: We have developed an automated coding system designed to assign codes to clinical diagnoses. The system uses the notion of certainty to recommend subsequent processing. Codes with the highest certainty are generated by matching the diagnostic text to frequent examples in a database of 22 million manually coded entries. These code assignments are not subject to subsequent manual review. Codes at a lower certainty level are assigned by matching to previously infrequently coded examples. The least certain codes are generated by a naive Bayes classifier. The latter two types of codes are subsequently manually reviewed. Measurements: Standard information retrieval accuracy measurements of precision, recall and f-measure were used. Micro- and macro-averaged results were computed. Results: At least 48% of all EMR problem list entries at the Mayo Clinic can be automatically classified with macro-averaged 98.0% precision, 98.3% recall and an f-score of 98.2%. An additional 34% of the entries are classified with macro-averaged 90.1% precision, 95.6% recall and 93.1% f-score. The remaining 18% of the entries are classified with macro-averaged 58.5%. Conclusion: Over two thirds of all diagnoses are coded automatically with high accuracy. The system has been successfully implemented at the Mayo Clinic, which resulted in a reduction of staff engaged in manual coding from thirty-four coders to seven verifiers.

J	Finn, A; Kushmerick, N				Finn, Aidan; Kushmerick, Nicholas			Learning to classify documents according to genre	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Computational Approaches to Style Analysis and Synthesis	AUG, 2003	Acapulco, MEXICO					Current document-retrieval tools succeed in locating large numbers of documents relevant to a given query. While search results may be relevant according to the topic of the documents, it is more difficult to identify which of the relevant documents are most suitable for a particular user. Automatic genre analysis (i.e., the ability to distinguish documents according to style) would be a useful tool for identifying documents that are most suitable for a particular user. We investigate the use of machine learning for automatic genre classification. We introduce the idea of domain transfer-genre classifiers should be reusable across multiple topics-which does not arise in standard text classification. We investigate different features for building genre classifiers and their ability to transfer across multiple-topic domains. We also show how different feature-sets can be used in conjunction with each other to improve performance and reduce the number of documents that need to be labeled.

This measure brings together elements from several different machine learning fields, namely information theory, graph theory and Mercer kernel and spectral theory. These connections are revealed when estimating the CS divergence non-parametrically using the Parzen window technique for density estimation.

Some evidence on forecasting time-series with support vector machines	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						time-series; forecasting; support vector machines	MODELS	The importance of predicting future values of a time-series transcends a range of disciplines. Economic and business time-series are typically characterized by trend, cycle, seasonal, and random components. Powerful methods have been developed to capture these components by specifying and estimating statistical models. These methods include exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and partially adaptive estimated ARIMA models. New research in pattern recognition through machine learning offers innovative methodologies that can improve forecasting performance. This paper presents a study of the comparative results of time-series analysis on nine problem domains, each of which exhibits differing time-series characteristics. Comparative analyses use ARIMA selection employing an intelligent agent, ARIMA estimation through partially adaptive methods, and support vector machines. The results find that support vector machines weakly dominate the other methods and achieve the best results in eight of nine different data sets.

The effect of principal component analysis on machine learning accuracy with high-dimensional spectral data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	25th SGAI International Conference on Innovative Techniques and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI-2005)	DEC 12-14, 2005	Cambridge, ENGLAND	British Comp Soc, Specialist Grp Artificial Intelligence		machine learning; high-dimensional data; principal component analysis; NIPALS; spectroscopy	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; CLASSIFICATION; CANCER	This paper presents the results of an investigation into the use of machine learning methods for the identification of narcotics from Raman spectra. The classification of spectral data and other high-dimensional data, such as images, gene-expression data and spectral data, poses an interesting challenge to machine learning, as the presence of high numbers of redundant or highly correlated attributes can seriously degrade classification accuracy. This paper investigates the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce high-dimensional spectral data and to improve the predictive performance of some well-known machine learning methods. Experiments are carried out on a high-dimensional spectral dataset. These experiments employ the NIPALS (Non-Linear Iterative Partial Least Squares) PCA method, a method that has been used in the field of chemometrics for spectral classification, and is a more efficient alternative than the widely used eigenvector decomposition approach. The experiments show that the use of this PCA method can improve the performance of machine learning in the classification of high-dimensional data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work we present another difficult task: learning, from large numbers of complex performances by concert pianists, to play music expressively. We model the problem as a multi-level decomposition and prediction task. We show that this is a fundamentally relational learning problem and propose a new similarity measure for structured objects, which is built into a relational instance-based learning algorithm named DISTALL. Experiments with data derived from a substantial number of Mozart piano sonata recordings by a skilled concert pianist demonstrate that the approach is viable. We show that the instance-based learner operating on structured, relational data outperforms a propositional k-NN algorithm. In qualitative terms, some of the piano performances produced by DISTALL after learning from the human artist are of substantial musical quality; one even won a prize in an international 'computer music performance' contest. The experiments thus provide evidence of the capabilities of ILP in a highly complex domain such as music.

J	Colton, S; Muggleton, S				Colton, Simon; Muggleton, Stephen			Mathematical applications of inductive logic programming	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming	SEP 29-OCT 01, 2003	Szeged, HUNGARY	Univ Szeged, Dept Informat, European Knowledge Discovery Network Excellence, Machine Learning, Minist Educ Hungary			DISCOVERY	The application of Inductive Logic Programming to scientific datasets has been highly successful. Such applications have led to breakthroughs in the domain of interest and have driven the development of ILP systems. The application of AI techniques to mathematical discovery tasks, however, has largely involved computer algebra systems and theorem provers rather than machine learning systems. We discuss here the application of the HR and Progol machine learning programs to discovery tasks in mathematics. While Progol is an established ILP system, HR has historically not been described as an ILP system. However, many applications of HR have required the production of first order hypotheses given data expressed in a Prolog-style manner, and the core functionality of HR can be expressed in ILP terminology. In Colton (2003), we presented the first partial description of HR as an ILP system, and we build on this work to provide a full description here. HR performs a novel ILP routine called Automated Theory Formation, which combines inductive and deductive reasoning to form clausal theories consisting of classification rules and association rules. HR generates definitions using a set of production rules, interprets the definitions as classification rules, then uses the success sets of the definitions to induce hypotheses from which it extracts association rules. It uses third party theorem provers and model generators to check whether the association rules are entailed by a set of user supplied axioms. HR has been applied successfully to a number of predictive, descriptive and subgroup discovery tasks in domains of pure mathematics. We survey various applications of HR which have led to it producing number theory results worthy of journal publication, graph theory results rivalling those of the highly successful Graffiti program and algebraic results leading to novel classification theorems. To further promote mathematics as a challenge domain for ILP systems, we present the first application of Progol to an algebraic domain-we use Progol to find algebraic properties of quasigroups, semigroups and magmas (groupoids) of varying sizes which differentiate pairs of non-isomorphic objects. This development is particularly interesting because algebraic domains have been an important proving ground for both deduction systems and constraint solvers. We believe that AI programs written for discovery tasks will need to simultaneously employ a variety of reasoning techniques such as induction, abduction, deduction, calculation and invention. We argue that mathematics is not only a challenging domain for the application of ILP systems, but that mathematics could be a good domain in which to develop a new generation of systems which integrate various reasoning techniques.

J	Hochbaum, DS; Levin, A				Hochbaum, Dorit S.; Levin, Asaf			Methodologies and algorithms for group-rankings decision	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						network flow; group ranking; decision making	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; NETWORK FLOW PROBLEM; PREFERENCE; CRITERIA; THEOREM; CUT	The problem of group ranking, also known as rank aggregation, has been studied in contexts varying from sports, to multicriteria decision making, to machine learning, to ranking Web pages, and to behavioral issues. The dynamics of the group aggregation of individual decisions has been a subject of central importance in decision theory. We present here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major shortcomings that exist in current models of group ranking. Moreover, the framework provides a specific performance measure for the quality of the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the individual decision-makers' rankings. The new model for the group-ranking problem presented here is based on rankings provided with intensity-that is, the degree of preference is quantified. The model allows for flexibility in decision protocols and can take into consideration imprecise beliefs, less than full confidence in some of the rankings, and differentiating between the expertise of the reviewers. Our approach relaxes frequently made assumptions of: certain beliefs in pairwise rankings; homogeneity implying equal expertise of all decision makers with respect to all evaluations; and full list requirement according to which each decision maker evaluates and ranks all objects. The option of preserving the ranks in certain subsets is also addressed in the model here. Significantly, our model is a natural extension and generalization of existing models, yet it is solvable in polynomial time. The group-rankings models are linked to network flow techniques.

Recently, several works have approached the splice-junction problem by applying methods from the field of machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose a hierarchical multiclassifier (HM) architecture, whose results show a drastically error reduction with respect to the performance of methods proposed in the literature.

Autonomic management has been introduced to alleviate these complex lengthy tasks. In this paper we propose all autonomic management of macro-diversity algorithm in umts networks. The new, approach allows to dynamically adapt micro-diversity parameters to varying network situations. The online adaptatiou of these parameters is made by an intelligent controller called fuzzy-Q-Learning. The combination of Fuzzy Iuference Systems (FIS) and Q-learniug algorilhin allows to determine the best on-line parameterization of base stations and to deal with large number of continuous states and actions. The proposed scheme improves the system capacity lip to 30% compared to a classical network with fixed parameters, balances the load between base stations and minimizes human interventions in the network management. However, the reactivity of the controller should be chosen with a special care since it impacts the frequency of active set updates and hence signalling messages in the radio interface as well (is in the core network.

The framework is obtained by integrating a machine learning software suite within the GRASS Geographical Information System (GIS) and by providing additional methods for predictive habitat modelling. Three machine learning techniques (Tree-Based Classification, Neural Networks and Random Forest) are available in parallel for modelling from climatic and topographic variables. Model evaluation and parameter selection are measured by sensitivity-specificity ROC analysis, while the final presence and absence maps are obtained through maximisation of the kappa statistic. The modelling framework is applied at a resolution of 1km. with Iberian subpopulations of Pinus sylvestris L. forests. For this data set, the most accurate algorithm is Breiman's random forest, an ensemble method which provides automatic combination of tree-classifiers trained on bootstrapped subsamples and randomised variable sets. All models show a potential area of P.syluestris for the Iberian Peninsula which is larger than the present one, a result corroborated by regional pollen analyses.

The key of the proposed approach is the use of the kernel methods recently developed in the field of machine learning. Several successful applications are presented, which show the capability of the kernel-based approach for detecting generalized synchronization, and dynamical change of the coupling strength between two chaotic systems can be captured by the proposed approach. It is also discussed how the kernel parameter is suitably chosen from data.

Integrated mechanistic and data-driven modelling for multivariate analysis of signalling pathways	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						apoptosis; machine learning; mechanistic modelling; signalling pathways; systems biology	MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; RECEPTOR; DEATH; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM; MODULE	Mathematical models of highly interconnected and multivariate signalling networks provide useful tools to understand these complex systems. However, effective approaches to extracting multivariate regulation information from these models are still lacking. In this study, we propose a data-driven modelling framework to analyse large-scale multivariate datasets generated from mathematical models. We used an ordinary differential equation based model for the Fas apoptotic pathway as an example. The first step in our approach was to cluster simulation outputs generated from models with varied protein initial concentrations. Subsequently, decision tree analysis was applied, in which we used protein concentrations to predict the simulation outcomes. Our results suggest that no single subset of proteins can determine the pathway behaviour. Instead, different subsets of proteins with different concentrations ranges can be important. We also used the resulting decision tree to identify the minimal number of perturbations needed to change pathway behaviours. In conclusion, our framework provides a novel approach to understand the multivariate dependencies among molecules in complex networks, and can potentially be used to identify combinatorial targets for therapeutic interventions.

For example, most classification and regression methods for microarray data are based on the whole set of genes and have not made use of pathway information. Pathway-based analysis in microarray studies may lead to more informative and relevant knowledge for biological researchers. Results: In this paper, we describe a pathway-based classification and regression method using Random Forests to analyze gene expression data. The proposed methods allow researchers to rank important pathways from externally available databases, discover important genes, find pathway-based outlying cases and make full use of a continuous outcome variable in the regression setting. We also compared Random Forests with other machine learning methods using several datasets and found that Random Forests classification error rates were either the lowest or the second-lowest. By combining pathway information and novel statistical methods, this procedure represents a promising computational strategy in dissecting pathways and can provide biological insight into the study of microarray data.

Although the inoculation is given in the skin, these adverse events suggest a robust systemic inflammatory response. To elucidate the cytokine response signature of systemic adverse events, we used a protein microarray technique to precisely quantitate 108 serum cytokines and chemokines in vaccine recipients before and 1 week after primary immunization with Aventis Pasteur smallpox vaccine. We studied 74 individuals after vaccination, of whom 22 experienced a systemic adverse event and 52 did not. The soluble factors most associated with adverse events were selected on the basis of voting among a committee of machine-learning methods and statistical procedures, and the selected cytokines were used to build a final decision-tree model. On the basis of changes in protein expression, we identified 6 cytokines that accurately discriminate between individuals on the basis of adverse event status: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, stem cell factor, monokine induced by interferon-gamma (CXCL9), intercellular adhesion molecule-1, eotaxin, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2. This cytokine signature is characteristic of particular inflammatory response pathways and suggests that the secretion of cytokines by fibroblasts plays a central role in systemic adverse events.

J	Karypis, G				Karypis, George			YASSPP: Better kernels and coding schemes lead to improvements in protein secondary structure prediction	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						structural bioinformaticsl; proteins; machine learning; support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALIGNMENTS; PROFILES; ACCURACY; MATRICES; DATABASE	The accurate prediction of a protein's secondary structure plays an increasingly critical role in predicting its function and tertiary structure, as it is utilized by many of the current state-of-the-art methods for remote homology, fold recognition, and ab initio structure prediction. We developed a new secondary structure prediction algorithm called YASSPP, which uses a pair of cascaded models constructed from two sets of binary SVM-based models. YASSPP uses an input coding scheme that combines both position-specific and nonposition-specific information, utilizes a kernel function designed to capture the sequence conservation signals around the local window of each residue, and constructs a second-level model by incorporating both the three-state predictions produced by the first-level model and information about the original sequence. Experiments on three standard datasets (RS126, C13513, and EVA common subset 4) show that YASSPP is capable of producing the highest Q3 and SOV scores than that achieved by existing widely used schemes such as PSIPRED, SSPro 4.0, SAM-T99sec, as well as previously developed SVM-based schemes. On the EVA dataset it achieves a Q3 and SOV score of 79.34 and 78.65%, which are considerably higher than the best reported scores of 77.64 and 76.05%, respectively.

J	O, JM; Lee, JW; Lee, JW; Zhang, BT				O, Jangmin; Lee, Jongwoo; Lee, Jae Won; Zhang, Byoung-Tak			Adaptive stock trading with dynamic asset allocation using reinforcement learning	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						stock trading; reinforcement learning; multiple-predictors approach; asset allocation	RECURRENT; RETURNS	Stock trading is an important decision-making problem that involves both stock selection and asset management. Though many promising results have been reported for predicting prices, selecting stocks, and managing assets using machine-learning techniques, considering all of them is challenging because of their complexity. In this paper, we present a new stock trading method that incorporates dynamic asset allocation in a reinforcement-learning framework. The proposed asset allocation strategy, called meta policy (MP), is designed to utilize the temporal information from both stock recommendations and the ratio of the stock fund over the asset. Local traders are constructed with pattern-based multiple predictors, and used to decide the purchase money per recommendation. Formulating the MP in the reinforcement learning framework is achieved by a compact design of the environment and the learning agent. Experimental results using the Korean stock market show that the proposed MP method outperforms other fixed asset-allocation strategies, and reduces the risks inherent in local traders.

This article shows how the former can be embedded in the latter via theory for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This connection facilitates cross-fertilization between the two bodies of research. In particular, connections between support vector machines and penalized splines are established. These allow for significant reductions in computational complexity, and easier incorporation of special structure such as additivity.

The resulting model is a hierarchical Bayesian network factored into modular component networks embedding variable-order Markov models. Each component network has an associated receptive field corresponding to components residing in the level directly below it in the hierarchy. The variable-order Markov models account for features that are invariant to naturally occurring transformations in their inputs. These invariant features give rise to increasingly stable, persistent representations as we ascend the hierarchy. The receptive fields of proximate components on the same level overlap to restore selectivity that might otherwise be lost to invariance.

J	Mjolsness, E; Yosiphon, G				Mjolsness, Eric; Yosiphon, Guy			Stochastic process semantics for dynamical grammars	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics	JAN 04-06, 2006	Ft Lauderdale, FL			stochastic processes; operator algebra; dynamical systems; multiscale modeling; probabilistic inference; machine learning	MODEL; NETWORKS	We define a class of probabilistic models in terms of an operator algebra of stochastic processes, and a representation for this class in terms of stochastic parameterized grammars. A syntactic specification of a grammar is formally mapped to semantics given in terms of a ring of operators, so that composition of grammars corresponds to operator addition or multiplication. The operators are generators for the time-evolution of stochastic processes. The dynamical evolution occurs in continuous time but is related to a corresponding discrete-time dynamics. An expansion of the exponential of such time-evolution operators can be used to derive a variety of simulation algorithms. Within this modeling framework one can express data clustering models, logic programs, ordinary and stochastic differential equations, branching processes, graph grammars, and stochastic chemical reaction kinetics. The mathematical formulation connects these apparently distant fields to one another and to mathematical methods from quantum field theory and operator algebra. Such broad expressiveness makes the framework particularly suitable for applications in machine learning and multiscale scientific modeling.

In this study, the predictive power of support vector machine (SVM)-based statistical analysis was tested. Methods: The clinical records of 246 patients who underwent SNB at our institution were used for this analysis. The following clinicopathologic variables were considered: the patient's age and sex and the tumor's histological subtype, Breslow thickness, Clark level, ulceration, mitotic index, lymphocyte infiltration, regression, angiolymphatic invasion, microsatellitosis, and growth phase. The results of SVM-based prediction of SLN status were compared with those achieved with logistic regression. Results: The SLN positivity rate was 22% (52 of 234). When the accuracy was >= 80%, the negative predictive value, positive predictive value, specificity, and sensitivity were 98%, 54%, 94%, and 77% and 82%, 41%, 69%, and 93% by using SVM and logistic regression, respectively. Moreover, SVM and logistic regression were associated with a diagnostic error and an SNB percentage reduction of (1) 1% and 60% and (2) 15% and 73%, respectively. Conclusions: The results from this pilot study suggest that SVM-based prediction of SLN status might be evaluated as a prognostic method to avoid the SNB procedure in 60% of patients currently eligible, with a very low error rate. If validated in larger series, this strategy would lead to obvious advantages in terms of both patient quality of life and costs for the health care system.

J	Cicekli, I; Cicekli, NK				Cicekli, I; Cicekli, NK			Generalizing predicates with string arguments	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						inductive logic programming; machine learning; string generalization	TRANSLATION TEMPLATES; INDUCTION; LOGIC	The least general generalization (LGG) of strings may cause an over-generalization in the generalization process of the clauses of predicates with string arguments. We propose a specific generalization (SG) for strings to reduce over-generalization. SGs of strings are used in the generalization of a set of strings representing the arguments of a set of positive examples of a predicate with string arguments. In order to create a SG of two strings, first, a unique match sequence between these strings is found. A unique match sequence of two strings consists of similarities and differences to represent similar parts and differing parts between those strings. The differences in the unique match sequence are replaced to create a SG of those strings. In the generalization process, a coverage algorithm based on SGs of strings or learning heuristics based on match sequences are used.

We perform various experiments with artificially generated irregularly-sampled data sets to study the effect of the various levels of noise and the presence of gaps of various size in the monitoring data. We compare the performance of our method with various other popular methods of estimating the time delay and conclude, from experiments with artificial data, that our method is least vulnerable to missing data and irregular sampling, within reasonable bounds of Gaussian noise. Thereafter, we use our method to determine the time delays between the two images of quasar Q0957+561 from radio monitoring data at 4 cm and 6 cm, and conclude that if only the observations at epochs common to both wavelengths are used, the time delay gives consistent estimates, which can be combined to yield 408 +/- 12 days.

Recent pharmacogenomics research in chemosensitivity prediction has studied the gene-drug correlation based on transcriptional profiling. However, proteomic profiling will more directly solve the current functional and pharmacologic problems. We sought to determine whether proteomic signatures of untreated cells were sufficient for the prediction of drug response. Experimental Design: In this study, a machine learning model system was developed to classify cell line chemosensitivity exclusively based on proteomic profiling. Using reverse-phase protein lysate microarrays, protein expression levels were measured by 52 antibodies in a panel of 60 human cancer cell (NCI-60) lines. The model system combined several well-known algorithms, including random forests, Relief, and the nearest neighbor methods, to construct the protein expression - based chemosensitivity classifiers. The classifiers were designed to be independent of the tissue origin of the cells. Results: A total of 118 classifiers of the complete range of drug responses (sensitive, intermediate, and resistant) were generated for the evaluated anticancer drugs, one for each agent. The accuracy of chemosensitivity prediction of all the evaluated 118 agents was significantly higher (P < 0.02) than that of random prediction. Furthermore, our study found that the proteomic determinants for chemosensitivity of 5-fluorouracil were also potential diagnostic markers of colon cancer. Conclusions: The results showed that it was feasible to accurately predict chemosensitivity by proteomic approaches. This study provides a basis for the prediction of drug response based on protein markers in the untreated tumors.

Identifying the interacting positions of a protein using Boolean learning and support vector machines	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						interacting position; OCAT; directed evolution; support vector machines; Boolean function; recombinations	SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION; RECOMBINATION; EVOLUTION; EXAMPLES; STRATEGIES; DESIGN	It is known that in the three-dimensional structure of a protein, certain amino acids can interact with each other in order to provide structural integrity or aid in its catalytic function. If these positions are mutated the loss of this interaction usually leads to a non-functional protein. Directed evolution experiments, which probe the sequence space of a protein through mutations in search for an improved variant, frequently result in such inactive sequences. In this work, we address the use of machine learning algorithms, Boolean learning and support vector machines (SVMs), to find such pairs of amino acid positions. The recombination method of imparting mutations was simulated to create in silico sequences that were used as training data for the algorithms. The two algorithms were combined together to develop an approach that weighs the structural risk as well as the empirical risk to solve the problem. This strategy was adapted to a multi-round framework of experiments where the data generated in the present round is used to design experiments for the next round to improve the generated library, as well as the estimation of the interacting positions. It is observed that this strategy can greatly improve the number of functional variants that are generated as well as the average number of mutations that can be made in the library.

Much of the previous work on IE from structured documents, such as HTML or XML, uses learning techniques that are based on strings, such as finite automata induction. These methods do not exploit the tree structure of the documents. A natural way to do this is to induce tree automata, which are like finite state automata but parse trees instead of strings. In this work, we explore induction of k-testable ranked tree automata from a small set of annotated examples. We describe three variants which differ in the way they generalize the inferred automaton. Experimental results on a set of benchmark data sets show that our approach compares favorably to string-based approaches. However, the quality of the extraction is still suboptimal.
