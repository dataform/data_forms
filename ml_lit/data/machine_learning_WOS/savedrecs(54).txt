Such knowledge is essential in order to predict future behavior in many domains such as: commercial applications where knowledge can be used to properly target marketing campaigns; computational biology applications where discovered knowledge can be used to predict novel unknown data that are being observed about biologically relevant entities; financial market analysis where extracted knowledge in the form of market patterns can help improve economic performance in front of novel unknown situations. Most of the available data presents relations among the interested entities and thus is maintained in databases that follow a relational schema. Hence knowledge discovery is mainly a process that involves the elaboration of relational databases. Such databases require the power of relational learning and the capability to deal with non i.i.d data. Moreover, most relational databases are noisy and present a lot of missing data. Statistical relational learning is a growing field in machine learning dealing with this kind of problems. In this paper we describe a statistical relational model based on markov logic networks and present recent developments regarding algorithmic novelties in this setting. We describe learning and inference algorithms that allow to discover knowledge from noisy relational databases and respond to queries about the data.

Contextual land-cover classification: incorporating spatial dependence in land-cover classification models using random forests and the Getis statistic	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article							MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS; LARGE AREAS; ACCURACY	Land-cover characterization of large heterogeneous landscapes is challenging because of the confusion caused by high intra-class variability and heterogeneous landscape artefacts. Neighbourhood context can be used to supplement spectral information, and a novel way of incorporating spatial dependence in a heterogeneous region is tested here using an ensemble learning technique called random forests and a measure of local spatial dependence called the Getis statistic. The overall Kappa accuracy of the random forest classifier that used a combination of spectral and local spatial (Getis) variables at three different neighbourhood sizes (3 x 3, 7 x 7, and 11 x 11) ranged from 0.85 to 0.92. This accuracy was higher than that of a non-spatial random forest classifier having an overall Kappa accuracy of 0.78, which was run using the spectral variables only. This study demonstrated that the use of the Getis statistic with different neighbourhood sizes leads to substantial increase in per class classification accuracy of heterogeneous land-cover categories.

A set of geometrical and grey level features from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) literature has been extracted from the regions of interest in order to characterize possible oil spills and feed the classification system. Results obtained by applying different machine learning classifiers to the dataset, and the achieved performance are discussed. In particular, as a first approach to oil spill classification, simple statistical classifiers and neural networks were used. Then, a more interpretable fuzzy rule-based classifier was employed, and performance evaluation was refined by exploiting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Finally, since oil spill dataset collection happens incrementally, a suitable technique for online classification was proposed, encompassing at the same time cost-oriented classification, in order to allow for a dynamic change of the misclassification costs. This latter goal has been achieved by building an ensemble of cost-oriented, incremental and decremental support vector machines, exploiting the concept of the ROC convex hull.

We look at this problem from an sequence analysis point of view, where we aim at solving the same classification task in different organisms. We investigate the challenge of combining information from several organisms, whereas we consider the relation between the organisms to be defined by a tree structure derived from their phylogeny. Multitask learning, a machine learning technique that recently received considerable attention, considers the problem of learning across tasks that are related to each other. We treat each organism as one task and present three novel multitask learning methods to handle situations in which the relationships among tasks can be described by a hierarchy. These algorithms are designed for large-scale applications and are therefore applicable to problems with a large number of training examples, which are frequently encountered in sequence analysis. We perform experimental analyses on synthetic data sets in order to illustrate the properties of our algorithms. Moreover, we consider a problem from genomic sequence analysis, namely splice site recognition, to illustrate the usefulness of our approach. We show that intelligently combining data from 15 eukaryotic organisms can indeed significantly improve the prediction performance compared to traditional learning approaches. On a broader perspective, we expect that algorithms like the ones presented in this work have the potential to complement and enrich the strategy of homology-based sequence analysis that are currently the quasi-standard in biological sequence analysis.

We examine this aspect of learning through a case study grounded in the robot soccer context. The task we consider is Keepaway, a popular benchmark for multiagent reinforcement learning from the simulation soccer domain. Whereas previous successful results in Keepaway have limited learning to an isolated, infrequent decision that amounts to a turn-taking behavior (passing), we expand the agents' learning capability to include a much more ubiquitous action (moving without the ball, or getting open), such that at any given time, multiple agents are executing learned behaviors simultaneously. We introduce a policy search method for learning "GETOPEN" to complement the temporal difference learning approach employed for learning "PASS". Empirical results indicate that the learned GETOPEN policy matches the best hand-coded policy for this task, and outperforms the best policy found when PASS is learned. We demonstrate that PASS and GETOPEN can be learned simultaneously to realize tightly-coupled soccer team behavior.

Due to the difficulty of modeling the various factors that determine motion (eg internal state, perception, etc.) this is often tackled by applying machine learning techniques to build a statistical model, using as input a collection of trajectories gathered through a sensor (eg camera, laser scanner), and then using that model to predict further motion. Unfortunately, most current techniques use off-line learning algorithms, meaning that they are not able to learn new motion patterns once the learning stage has finished. In this paper, we present an approach which is able to learn new motion patterns incrementally, and in parallel with prediction. Our work is based on a novel extension to Hidden Markov Models called Crowing Hidden Markov models.

For the evaluation we propose a large and high-quality dataset: 2000 ACM papers from the Computer Science domain. We evaluate by comparison with expert-assigned keyphrases. Evaluation shows promising results that outperform state-of-the-art Bayesian learning system KEA improving the average F-Measure from 22% (KEA) to 30% (Random Forest) on the same dataset without the use of controlled vocabularies. Finally, we report a detailed analysis of the effect of the individual NLP features and data set size on the overall quality of extracted keyphrases.

In this paper we describe a method building on and extending existing methods from the areas of thesaurus maintenance, natural language processing, and machine learning to (a) extract a set of novel candidate concepts from text corpora and (b) to generate a small ranked list of suggestions for the position of these concept in an existing thesaurus. Based On a modification of the standard tf-idf term weighting we extract relevant concept candidates from a document corpus. We then apply a pattern-based machine learning approach on content extracted from web search engine snippets to determine the type of relation between the candidate terms and existing thesaurus concepts. The approach is evaluated with a large-scale experiment using the MeSH and Word Net thesauri as testbed.

This paper describes a new hierarchical clustering algorithm for learning concept hierarchy named Clonal Selection Algorithm for Learning Concept Hierarchy, or CLONACH. The proposed algorithm resembles the CLONALG. CLONACH's effectiveness is evaluated on three data sets. The results show that the concept hierarchy produced by CLONACH is better than the agglomerative clustering technique in terms of taxonomic overlaps. Thus, the CLONALG based algorithm has been regarded as a promising technique in learning from texts, in particular small collection of texts.

As we all know, rough set theory works better on discretized or binarized data. However, most real life data sets consist of not only discrete attributes but also continuous attributes. In this paper, we propose a supervised and multivariate discretization algorithm - SMD for rough sets. SMD uses both class information and relations between attributes to determine the discretization scheme. To evaluate algorithm SMD, we ran the algorithm on real life data sets obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results show that our algorithm is effective. And the time complexity of our algorithm is relatively low, compared with the current multivariate discretization algorithms.

Due to the dramatic increasing of information, traditional data preprocessing techniques are time-consuming and not fit for processing mass data. In order to tackle this problem, we present parallel data preprocessing techniques based on MapReduce which is a programming model to implement parallelization easily. This paper gives the implementation details of the techniques including data integration, data cleaning, data normalization and so on. The proposed parallel techniques can deal with large-scale data (up to terabytes) efficiently. Our experimental results show considerable speedup performances with an increasing number of processors.

TUNEDIT is composed of three complementary and interconnected components: Tuned Tester, Repository and Knowledge Base. TunedTester is a stand-alone Java application that runs automated tests (experiments) of algorithms. Repository is a database of algorithms, datasets and evaluation procedures used by Tuned Tester for setting up a test. Knowledge Base is a database of test results. Repository and Knowledge Base are accessible through TUNEDIT website. TUNEDIT is open and free for use by any researcher. Every registered user can upload new resources to Repository, run experiments with Tuned Tester, send results to Knowledge Base and browse all collected results, generated either by himself or by others. As a special functionality, built upon the framework of automated tests, TUNEDIT provides a platform for organization of on-line interactive competitions for machine-learning problems. This functionality may be used, for instance, by teachers to launch contests for their students instead of traditional assignment tasks; or by organizers of machine-learning and data-mining conferences to launch competitions for the scientific community, in association with the conference.

Integrating background knowledge from internet databases into predictive toxicology models	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						(Q)SAR; data integration; internet databases; cheminformatics; machine learning		While data integration for data analysis has been investigated extensively in biological applications, it has not yet been so much the focus in computational chemistry and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) research. With the availability and growing number of chemical databases on the web, such data integration efforts become an intriguing possibility (and, in fact, a necessity). In this paper, we take a first step towards the following vision and scenario for predictive toxicology applications. Given a new structure to be predicted, the first step would be to gather (integrate) all relevant information from internet databases for the structure itself, and all structures with available information for the endpoint of interest. In a second step, the collected information is combined statistically into a prediction of the new structure. We simulate this scenario with three endpoints (data sets) from the DSSTox database and collect information from three public chemical databases: PubChem, ChemBank and Sigma-Aldrich. In the experiments, we investigate whether the addition of background knowledge from the three databases can improve predictive performance (over using chemical structure alone) in a statistically significant way. For this purpose, we define groups of features (belonging together from an application point of view) from the three databases, and perform a variant of forward selection to include these feature groups in a prediction model. Our experiments show that the integration of background knowledge from internet databases can significantly improve prediction performance, especially for regression tasks.

The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) provides a useful method for hazard assessment. In this study, we constructed a QSAR model based on a highly heterogeneous data set of 571 compounds from the US Environmental Protection Agency, for predicting acute toxicity to the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). An approach coupling support vector regression (SVR) with the genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to build the model. The generated QSAR model showed excellent data fitting and prediction abilities: the squared correlation coefficients (r2) for the training set and the test set were 0.826 and 0.802, respectively. Only eight critical descriptors, most of which are closely related to the toxicity mechanism, were chosen by GA-SVR, making the derived model readily interpretable. In summary, the successful case reported here highlights that our GA-SVR approach can be used as a general machine learning method for toxicity prediction.

It is infeasible to collect all the data together to train a global learner for prediction; even exchanging learners trained on different sites is costly. In this paper, aggregative-learning is proposed. In this paradigm, every site maintains a local learner trained from its own data. Upon receiving a request for prediction, an aggregative-learner at a local site activates and sends out many mobile agents taking the request to potential remote learners. The prediction of the aggregative-learner is made by combining the local prediction and the responses brought back by the agents. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show the superiority of the proposed method.

B	Hoffmann, A; Mahidadia, A		Gaber, MM		Hoffmann, Achim; Mahidadia, Ashesh			Machine Learning	SCIENTIFIC DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY: PRINCIPLES AND FOUNDATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter							SYSTEMS	The purpose of this chapter is to present fundamental ideas and techniques of machine learning suitable for the field of this book, i.e., for automated scientific discovery. The chapter focuses on those symbolic machine learning methods, which produce results that are suitable to be interpreted and understood by humans. This is particularly important ill the context of automated scientific discovery as the scientific theories to be produced by machines are usually meant to be interpreted by humans. This chapter contains some of the most influential ideas and concepts ill machine learning research to give the reader a basic insight into the field. After the introduction in Sect. 1, general ideas of flow learning problems call be framed are given in Sect. 2. The section provides useful perspectives to better understand what learning algorithms actually do. Section 3 presents the Version space model which is an early learning algorithm as well as a conceptual framework, that provides important insight into the general mechanisms behind most learning algorithms. In section 4, a family of learning, algorithms, the AQ family for learning classification rules is presented. The AQ family belongs to the early approaches in machine learning. The next, Sect. 5 presents the basic principles of decision tree learners. Decision tree learners belong to the most influential class of inductive learning algorithms today. Finally, a more recent group of learning systems are presented in Sect. 6, which learn relational concepts within the framework of logic programming. This is a particularly interesting group of learning systems since the framework allows also to incorporate background knowledge which may assist in generalisation. Section 7 discusses Association Rules - a technique that comes from the related field of Data mining. Section 8 presents the basic idea of the Naive Bayesian Classifier. While this is a very popular learning technique, the learning result is not well suited for human comprehension as it is essentially a large collection of probability values. In Sect. 9, we present a generic method for improving accuracy of a given learner by L,encratin2 multiple classifiers using variations of the training data. While this works well in most cases, the resulting classifiers have significantly increased complexity and, hence, tend to destroy the human readability of the learning result that a single learner may produce. Section 10 contains a summary, mentions briefly other techniques not discussed in this chapter and presents outlook on the potential of machine learning in the future.

B	Williamson, J		Gaber, MM		Williamson, Jon			The Philosophy of Science and its relation to Machine Learning	SCIENTIFIC DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY: PRINCIPLES AND FOUNDATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter							DISCOVERY	In this chapter I discuss connections between machine learning and the philosophy of science. First I consider the relationship between the two disciplines. There is a clear analogy between hypothesis choice in science and model selection in machine learning. While this analogy has been invoked to argue that the two disciplines are essentially doing the same thing and should merge, I maintain that the disciplines are distinct but related and that there is a dynamic interaction operating between the two: a series of mutually beneficial interactions that changes over time. I will introduce some particularly fruitful interactions, in particular the consequences of automated scientific discovery for the debate on inductivism versus falsificationism in the philosophy of science, and the importance of philosophical work oil Bayesian epistemology and causality for contemporary machine learning. I will close by suggesting the locus of a possible future interaction: evidence integration.

As such, dataspaces join a long stream of research activities that aim to build tools that simplify integrated access to distributed data. To address dataspace challenges, many different techniques may need to be considered: data integration from multiple sources, machine learning approaches to resolving schema heterogeneity, integration of structured and unstructured data, management of uncertainty, and query processing and optimization. Results that seek to realize die different visions exhibit considerable variety in their contexts, priorities and techniques. This chapter presents a classification of the key concepts in the area, encouraging the use of consistent terminology, and enabling a systematic comparison of proposals. This chapter also seeks to identify common and complementary ideas in the dataspace and search computing literatures, in so doing identifying opportunities for both areas and open issues for further research.

This paper presents a license plate detection prototype system for a Macao law enforcement department using Modest Adaboost combined with template matching technique. Firstly, a machine learning algorithm, based on Modest AdaBoost which mostly aims for better generalization capability and resistance to overfitting, was applied to find out candidate license plates over the input images. In the second stage, template matching technique was employed to verify the license plate appearances in order to reduce false positives. This paper shows that the AdaBoost algorithm, which was originally used for face detection, has successfully been applied to solve the problems of license plate detection. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Most current intrusion detection systems focus on hybrid supervised and unsupervised machine learning technologies. The related work has demonstrated that they can get superior performance than applying single machine learning algorithm in detection model. Besides, with the scrutiny of related works, feature selecting and representing techniques are also essential in pursuit of high efficiency and effectiveness. Performance of specified attack type detection should also be improved and evaluated. In this paper, we incorporate information gain (IG) method for selecting more discriminative features and triangle area based support vector machine (TASVM) by combining k-means clustering algorithm and SVM classifier to detect attacks. Our system achieves accuracy of 99.83%, detection rate of 99.88% and false alarm rate of 2.99% on the 10% of KDD CUP 1999 evaluation data set. We also achieve a better detection performance for specific attack types concerning precision and recall.

For example, attackers can freely manipulate byte distributions within the attack payloads and also can inject well-crafted noisy packets to contaminate the suspicious flow pool. To address these attacks, we propose SAS, a novel Semantics Aware Statistical algorithm for automatic signature generation. When SAS processes packets in a suspicious flow pool, it uses data flow analysis techniques to remove non-critical bytes. We then apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to the refined data to generate state-transition-graph based signatures. To our best knowledge, this is the first work combining semantic analysis with statistical analysis to automatically generate worm signatures. Our experiments show that the proposed technique can accurately detect worms with concise signatures. Moreover, our results indicate that SAS is more robust to the byte distribution changes and noise injection attacks comparing to Polygraph and Hamsa.

This recognition and resolution of named entities can be leveraged in a number of ways including providing hypertext links to information stored about a particular judge their education, who appointed them. their other case opinions, etc This paper discusses named entity recognition and resolution in legal documents such as US case law, depositions. and pleadings and other trial documents. The types of entities include judges, attorneys, companies, jurisdictions, and courts We outline three methods for named entity recognition, lookup, context text tiles, and statistical models We then describe an actual system for finding named entitles in legal text and evaluate its accuracy Similarly, for resolution, we discuss our blocking techniques, our resolution features, and the supervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques we employ for the filial matching	[Dozier, Christopher; Kondadadi, Ravikumar; Light, Marc; Vachher, Arun; Veeramachanem, Sriharsha; Wudah, Ramdev] Thomson Reuters Res & Dev, Eagan, MN 55123 USA	Dozier, C (reprint author), Thomson Reuters Res & Dev, Eagan, MN 55123 USA.	chris.dozier@thomsonreuters.com; ravikumar.kondadadi@thomsonreuters.com; marc.light@thomsonreuters.com; arun.vachher@thomsonreuters.com; harsha.veeramachaneni@thomsonreuters.com; ramdev.wudali@thomsonreuters.com					CHAUDHARY M, 2006, P IASTED INT C LAW T; Cohen W.W., 2003, P IJCAI 03 WORKSH IN, P73; DOZIER C, 2004, P ACL 2004 WORKSH RE, P9; DOZIER C, 2009, FAME COREFERENCE RES; DOZIER C, 2000, P RIAO 2000 CONT BAS, P1305; GRISHMAN R, 1996, P 5 MESS UND C MUC 5, P1; Lafferty J., 2001, P ICML; LIAO W, 2009, P NAACL 2009 WORKSH; Quaresma P, 2010, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V6036, P44, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-12837-0_3; YEH A, 2005, BMC BIOINFORMATIC S1, V6	10	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	978-3-642-12836-3	LECT NOTES ARTIF INT			2010	6036						27	43			10.1007/978-3-642-12837-0	17	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science; Law	Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Government & Law	BQH36	WOS:000281006800002

However, in the recent years, it becomes evident that one of the most important directions of improvement in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, like word sense disambiguation, coreference resolution, relation extraction, and other tasks related to knowledge extraction, is by exploiting semantics. While in the past, the unavailability of rich and complete semantic descriptions constituted a serious limitation of their applicability, nowadays, the Semantic Web made available a large amount of logically encoded information (e.g. ontologies, RDF(S)-data, linked data, etc.), which constitutes a valuable source of semantics. However, web semantics cannot be easily plugged into machine learning systems. Therefore the objective of this paper is to define a reference methodology for combining semantic information available in the web under the form of logical theories, with statistical methods for NLP. The major problems that we have to solve to implement our methodology concern (i) the selection of the correct and minimal knowledge among the large amount available in the web, (ii) the representation of uncertain knowledge, and (iii) the resolution and the encoding of the rules that combine knowledge retrieved from Semantic Web sources with semantics in the text. In order to evaluate the appropriateness of our approach, we present an application of the methodology to the problem of intra-document coreference resolution, and we show by means of some experiments on the standard dataset, how the injection of knowledge leads to the improvement of this task performance.

Machine learning is the preferred technique adopted for many named entity classification methods where the choice of features is critical to final performance. Existing approaches explore only the features derived from the characteristic of the named entity itself or its linguistic context. With the development of the Semantic Web, a large number of data sources are published and connected across the Web as Linked Open Data (LOD). LOD provides rich a priori knowledge about entity type information, knowledge that can be a valuable asset when used in connection with named entity classification. In this paper, we explore the use of LOD to enhance named entity classification. Our method extracts information from LOD and builds a type knowledge base which is used to score a (named entity string, type) pair. This score is then injected as one or more features into the existing classifier in order to improve its performance. We conducted a thorough experimental study and report the results, which confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.			niyuan@cn.ibm.com; lzhangl@cn.ibm.com; qiuzhaom@cn.ibm.com; chenwang@cn.ibm.com; lzhangl@cn.ibm.com					Banerjee S., 2003, P 18 INT JOINT C ART; BANKO M, 2008, COMMUNICATIONS ACM; BIKEL DM, 1997, P 5 C APPL NAT LANG; CIMIANO P, 2005, P INT C REC ADV NAT; ETZIONI O, 2004, P 13 INT C WORLD WID; EVANS R, 2003, P RECENT ADV NATURAL; Fellbaum C., 1998, WORDNET ELECT LEXICA; FLEISCHMAN M, 2002, P 19 INT C COMP LING; GANTI V, 2008, P 14 ACM SIGKDD INT; GIULIANO C, 2008, P 22 INT C COMP LING; Giuliano C., 2009, P 13 C COMP NAT LANG; GIULIANO C, 2007, JLSI LATENT SEMANTIC; HARABAGIU S, 2000, P 9 TEXT RETRIEVAL C; HIRSCHMAN L, 1997, P 7 MESS UND C MUC 7; Jijkoun V., 2004, P 13 TEXT RETRIEVAL; KWOK CCT, 2001, P 10 WORLD WID WEB C; NADEAU D, 2007, LINGUISTICAE INVESTI; OPENCYC; REDIRECTS	19	1	1	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	978-3-642-17745-3	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2010	6496		I				566	581				16	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BXY35	WOS:000297613200036

In this article, we present ORE, a tool for repairing and enriching OWL ontologies. State-of-the-art methods in ontology debugging and supervised machine learning form the basis of ORE and are adapted or extended so as to work well in practice. ORE supports the detection of a variety of ontology modelling problems and guides the user through the process of resolving them. Furthermore, the tool allows to extend an ontology through (semi-)automatic supervised learning. A wizard-like process helps the user to resolve potential issues after axioms are added.

The combination of DLA and ILP have following benefits: Manual selection of learning features is not needed. The learning procedure has full available linguistic information at its disposal and it is capable to select relevant parts itself. Learned extraction rules can be easily visualized, understood and adapted by human. A description, implementation and initial evaluation of the method are the main contributions of the paper.

Through these techniques, participants act both as authors and reviewers over each other's work. However, as web-based cooperating environments continuously grow in popularity, there is a need to develop intelligent mechanisms that will retrieve the optimal group of reviewers to comment on the work of each author, with a view to increasing the usefulness that these comments will have on the author's final result. This paper introduces a novel technique that incorporates feed forward neural networks to determine the optimal reviewers for a specific author during a peer assessment procedure. The proposed method seeks to match author to reviewer profiles based on feedback regarding the usefulness of reviewer comments as it was perceived by the author. The proposed mechanism is expected to improve the peer assessment procedure, by making it adaptive to individual user characteristics, increasing the quality of the projects of a group overall and speeding up the peer assessment procedure. The method was tested on educational data derived from an e-learning course and the preliminary results that it yielded are promising.

Hypergame theory extends classical game theory with the ability to deal with differences in players' expertise, differences in their understanding of game rules, misperceptions, and so forth. Each of these different sub-scenarios, or subgames, is associated with a probability - representing the likelihood that the given subgame is truly "in play" at a given moment. In order to form an optimal attack or defense policy, these probabilities must be learned if they're not known a-priori. We present hidden Markov model and maximum entropy approaches for accurately learning these probabilities through multiple iterations of both normal and modified game play. We also given a widely-applicable approach for the analysis of cases where an opponent is aware that he is being studied, and intentionally plays to spoil the process of learning and thereby obfuscate his attributes. These are considered in the context of a generic, abstract cyber attach example. We demonstrate that machine learning efficacy can be heavily dependent on the goals and styles of participant behaviour. To this end detailed simulation results under various combinations of attacker and defender behaviors are presented and analyzed.

SVM is a data processing technique that performs binary classification. The machine in its name indicates its association with machine learning, a category of algorithms that are able to solve classification problems by learning from example data given in a training process. This paper uses SVM for abnormality detection on data from a cable-stayed bridge's health monitoring system. The goal is to investigate whether the east end expansion joint is constraining the longitudinal motion of the bridge's main girder, which is suspected due to the results of a finite element updating procedure. Regarding the training process, distinct examples of the normal and abnormal expansion joint are unavailable from the health monitoring system. For this reason training examples are obtained from a finite element model. Accordingly, since SVM accuracy is highly dependent on the similarity between the training data and data being classified, the finite element modeling is a primary challenge of the paper's approach. The contributions of this paper include an application of SVM to an in-service structure, as well as a discussion on its performance and some limitations that affect its accuracy.

For service providers, it is essential to prevent SLA violations as much as possible to enhance customer satisfaction and avoid penalty payments. Therefore, it is desirable for providers to predict possible violations before they happen, while it is still possible to set counteractive measures. We propose an approach for predicting SLA violations at runtime, which uses measured and estimated facts (instance data of the composition or QoS of used services) as input for a prediction model. The prediction model is based on machine learning regression techniques, and trained using historical process instances. We present the basics of our approach, and briefly validate our ideas based on an illustrative example.

FAST ALGORITHMS FOR THE GENERALIZED FOLEY-SAMMON DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS	SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						dimension reduction; linear discriminant analysis; regularization; Foley-Sammon transform; global convergence; quadratic convergence	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; UNDERSAMPLED PROBLEMS; FACE RECOGNITION; CRITERION; REDUCTION	Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is one of the most popular approaches for feature extraction and dimension reduction to overcome the curse of the dimensionality of the high-dimensional data in many applications of data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. In this paper, we made two main contributions to an important LDA scheme, the generalized Foley-Sammon transform (GFST) [Foley and Sammon, IEEE Trans. Comput., 24 (1975), pp. 281-289; Guo et al., Pattern Recognition Lett., 24 (2003), pp. 147-158] or a trace ratio model [Wang et al., Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2007, pp. 1-8] and its regularized GFST (RGFST), which handles the undersampled problem that involves small samples size n, but with high number of features N (N > n) and arises frequently in many modern applications. Our first main result is to establish an equivalent reduced model for the RGFST which effectively improves the computational overhead. The iteration method proposed by Wang et al. is applied to solve the GFST or the reduced RGFST. It has been proven by Wang et al. that this iteration converges globally and fast convergence was observed numerically, but there is no theoretical analysis on the convergence rate thus far. Our second main contribution completes this important and missing piece by proving the quadratic convergence even under two kinds of inexact computations. Practical implementations, including computational complexity and storage requirements, are also discussed. Our experimental results on several real world data sets indicate the efficiency of the algorithm and the advantages of the GFST model in classification.

Recently, an efficient incremental approach was presented for the fast calculation of the dominant kernel eigen-basis. In this paper we propose faster algorithms for incrementally updating and downsizing the dominant kernel eigenbasis. These methods are well-suited for large scale problems since they are efficient in terms of both complexity and data management.

In this paper we explore whether the use of proximity and phrase information can improve web retrieval accuracy. We build on existing research by incorporating novel ranking features based on flexible proximity terms with recent state-of-the-art machine learning ranking models. We introduce a method of determining the goodness of a set of proximity terms that takes advantage of the structured nature of web documents, document metadata, and phrasal information from search engine user query logs. We perform experiments on a large real-world Web data collection and show that using the goodness score of flexible proximity terms can improve ranking accuracy over state-of-the-art ranking methods by as much as 13%. We also show that we can improve accuracy on the hardest queries by as much as 9% relative to state-of-the-art approaches.

This community value and related services like search and advertising are threatened by spammers, content polluters, and malware disseminators. In an effort to preserve community value and ensure long-term success, we propose and evaluate a honeypot-based approach for uncovering social spammers in online social systems. Two of the key components of the proposed approach are: (1) The deployment of social honeypots for harvesting deceptive spam profiles from social networking communities; and (2) Statistical analysis of the properties of these spam profiles for creating spam classifiers to actively filter out existing and new spammers. We describe the conceptual framework and design considerations of the proposed approach, and we present concrete observations from the deployment of social honeypots in MySpace and Twitter. We find that the deployed social honeypots identify social spammers with low false positive rates and that the harvested spam data contains signals that are strongly correlated with observable profile features (e.g., content, friend information, posting patterns, etc.). Based on these, profile features, we develop machine learning based classifiers for I identifying previously unknown spammers with high precision and a low rate of false positives.

One of the key components of MIR that has been actively researched into is music tagging. While significant progress has been achieved, most of the existing systems still adopt a simple classification approach, and apply machine learning classifiers directly on low level acoustic features. Consequently, they suffer the shortcomings of (1) poor accuracy, (2) lack of comprehensive evaluation results and the associated analysis based on large scale datasets, and (3) incomplete content representation, arising from the lack of multimodal and temporal information integration. In this paper, we introduce a novel system called MMTagger that effectively integrates both multimodal and temporal information in the representation of music signal. The carefully designed multilayer architecture of the proposed classification framework seamlessly combines Multiple Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) into a single framework. The structure preserves more discriminative information, leading to more accurate and robust tagging. Experiment results obtained with two large music collections highlight the various advantages of our multilayer framework over state of the art techniques.

On the other hand, discriminative models have received little attention in expert search research, although they have been shown to outperform generative models in many other information retrieval and machine learning applications. In this paper, we propose a principled relevance-based discriminative learning framework for expert search and derive specific discriminative models from the framework. Compared with the state-of-the-art language models for expert search, the proposed research can naturally integrate various document evidence and document-candidate associations into a single model without extra modeling assumptions or effort.

The central challenge of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The aim of this tutorial is to present the state of the art in Computational Advertising, in particular in its IR-related aspects, and to expose the participants to the current research challenges in this field. The tutorial does not assume any prior knowledge of Web advertising, and will begin with a comprehensive background survey. Going deeper, our focus will be on using a textual representation of the user context to retrieve relevant ads. At first approximation, this process can be reduced to a conventional setup by constructing a query that describes the user context and executing the query against a large inverted index of ads. We show how to augment this approach using query expansion and text classification techniques tuned for the ad-retrieval problem. In particular, we show how to use the Web as a repository of query-specific knowledge and use the Web search results retrieved by the query as a form of a relevance feedback and query expansion. We also present solutions that go beyond the conventional bag of words indexing by constructing additional features using a large external taxonomy and a lexicon of named entities obtained by analyzing the entire Web as a corpus. The last part of the tutorial will be devoted to a potpourri of recent research results and open problems inspired by Computational Advertising challenges in text summarization, natural language generation, named entity recognition, computer-human interaction, and other SIGIR-relevant areas.

Discovery on documents stored in computerized systems (known variously as electronic discovery, e-discovery, e-disco, EDD, and ED) is increasingly the major factor in discovery, and has become a multi-billion dollar industry. I will discuss the basics of c-discovery, the scale and diversity of the materials involved, and the economics of identifying and reviewing potentially responsive material. I will then focus on three major IR areas of interest: search, supervised machine learning (including text classification and relevance feedback), and interface support for manual relevance assessment. For each, I will discuss technologies currently used in e-discovery, the evaluation methods applicable to measuring effectiveness, and existing research results not yet seeing commercial practice. I will also outline research directions that, if successfully pursued, would potentially be of great interest in e-discovery applications. A particular focus will be on areas where researchers can make progress without access to operational e-discovery environments or "realistic" test collections. Connections will be drawn with the use of IR in related tasks, such as enterprise search, criminal investigations, intelligence analysis, historical research, truth and reconciliation commissions, and freedom of information (open records or sunshine law) requests.			sigir2010tutorial@DavidDLewis.com						0	0	0	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA		978-1-60558-896-4				2010							913	913				1	Computer Science, Information Systems	Computer Science	BTG52	WOS:000286904100207

This has led to development of fast and numerically efficient algorithms for Raman spectra estimation. There are two types of algorithms for Raman spectra estimation, namely supervised and unsupervised. In the supervised approach, a number of reference spectra for known chemicals is used. It is also assumed that the measured spectra of one or more unknown substances belong to one of the individual substances in the reference library, or that they originate from a linear combination of a number of reference spectra. The mixing coefficients for a measured spectrum are often estimated using the nonnegative least squares (NNLS) or nonnegative weighted least squares (NNWLS) algorithms. This is a constrained parameter estimation problem due to the inherent nonnegativity of the mixing coefficients. Some previous researchers have used the NNLS method, in which no weight matrix is used, or all measurement error variances are treated as equal. In our Fusion 2009 paper, we found that the measurement error variances or weights vary significantly with the wavenumber and that it is therefore necessary to use non-uniform weights in parameter estimation. Previously we used the true weights and have done limited study using estimated weights. In this paper, we perform extensive study for Raman spectra estimation using WLS and NNWLS for one, two, and three chemicals, using simulated data and Monte Carlo simulations.

Our objective is to determine the chemical composition of an unknown substance given a reference library of Raman spectra. The unknown spectrum is expressed as a linear combination of the reference library spectra and the non-zero mixing coefficients represent the presence of individual substances, which are not known. This approach is known as the supervised learning method. The mixing coefficients are usually estimated using the nonnegative least squares (NNLS) or nonnegative weighted least squares (NNWLS). This problem is a constrained estimation problem due to the presence of the nonnegativity constraint. In this paper, we present a swarm based algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO), to estimate the mixing coefficients and Raman spectra. The PSO is used to determine the mixing coefficients. PSO efficiently finds an optimum solution. Results are presented for simulated data obtained from the Jennifer Kelly Raman spectra library. The reference library consists of Raman spectra for nine minerals and the measured spectrum is simulated by using spectrum/spectra of single/multiple minerals. We compare the root mean square error (RMSE) for parameter estimation and measurement residual and computational time of the NNWLS and nonnegative weighted PSO (NNWPSO) algorithms.

In this paper we propose a new large margin nearest local mean (LMNLM) scheme to consider them jointly, which aims at improving the separability between local parts of different classes. We adopt 'local mean vector' as the basic classification model, and then through linear transformation, large margins between heterogeneous local parts are introduced. Moreover, by eigenvalue decomposition, we may also reduce data's dimensions. LMNLM can be formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, so it is assured to converge globally. Experimental results show that LMNLM is a promising algorithm due to its leading to high classification accuracies and low dimensions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sensor is a nano-nose gas sensor that detects concentrations of analytes down to ppm levels using plasma polymorized coatings. Each sensor experiment takes approximately one hour hence the number of available training data is limited. We suggest a data-driven classification model which work from few examples. The paper compares a number of data-driven classification and quantification schemes able to detect the gas and the concentration level.

They are used for attribute selection, fuzzy set selection, rule selection, membership function tuning, and so on. Genetics-based machine learning (GBML) is one of the promising evolutionary algorithms for classifier design. It can find an appropriate combination of antecedent sets for each rule in a classifier. Although GBML has high search ability, it needs long computation time especially for large data sets. In this paper, we apply a parallel distributed implementation to our fuzzy genetics-based machine learning. In our method, we divide not only a population but also a training data set into subgroups. These subgroups are assigned to CPU cores. Through computational experiments on large data sets, we show the effectiveness of the proposed parallel distributed implementation.

EcoSupply: A Machine Learning Framework for Analyzing the Impact of Ecosystem on Global Supply Chain Dynamics	SIMULATED EVOLUTION AND LEARNING	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference of Simulated Evolution and Learning	DEC 01-04, 2010	Kanpur, INDIA	Golden Jubilee Comm, IIT Kanpur, Dept Sci & Technol New Delhi, Council Sci & Ind Res	Indian Inst Technol Kanpur	Supply Chains; Global Sourcing; Machine Learning		A global supply chain spans several regions and countries across the globe. A tremendous spurt in the extent of globalization has necessitated the need for modeling global supply chains in place of the conventional supply chains. In this paper, we propose a framework, Eco-Supply, to analyze the supply chain ecosystem in a probabilistic setting unlike the existing methodologies, which presume a deterministic context. EcoSupply keeps track of the previous observations in order to facilitate improved prediction about the influence of uncertainties in the ecosystem, and provides a coherent mathematical exposition to construe the new associations, among the different supply chain stakeholders, in place of the existing links. To the best of our knowledge, EcoSupply is the first machine learning based paradigm to incorporate the dynamics of global supply chains.

Shape analysis is one of the main approaches to the problem. In this paper we propose the use of a reduced set of features to describe 2D shapes in images. The design of the proposed technique aims to result in a short and simple to extract shape description. We conducted several experiments for both retrieval and recognition tasks and the results obtained demonstrate usefulness and competiveness against existing descriptors. For the retrieval experiment the achieved bull's eye performance is about 60%. Recognition was tested with three different classifiers: decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machines (SVM). Estimated mean accuracies range from 69% to 86% (using 10-fold cross validation). The SVM classifier presents the best performance, followed by the simple kNN classifier.

With this machine learning approach, no database of explicit object representations is used for template matching on a complete scene instead, grouping decisions are based on limited spatio-temporal context. We employ two different classifier formalisms for this time series analysis task, namely Echo State Networks (ESNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). ESNs present internal-state classifiers with inherent memory capabilities. For the conventional static SVM, short-term memory is supplied externally via fixed-length feature vector expansion. We compare the respective setup heuristics and conduct experiments with two exemplary problems. Promising results are achieved with both formalisms. Yet, our experiments indicate that using ESNs for variable-length memory tasks alleviates the risk of overfitting due to non-expressive features or improperly determined temporal embedding dimensions.

This paper presents Articulate, an attempt at a semi-automated visual analytic model that is guided by a conversational user interface to allow users to verbally describe and then manipulate what they want to see. We use natural language processing and machine learning methods to translate the imprecise sentences into explicit expressions, and then apply a heuristic graph generation algorithm to create a suitable visualization. The goal is to relieve the user of the burden of having to learn a complex user-interface in order to craft a visualization.

Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors show promise in aerospace applications since they are immune to electromagnetic interference and can support multiple sensors in a single fiber. However, since they only measure strain along the length of the fiber, a prediction scheme that can estimate loading using randomly oriented sensors is key to damage state awareness. This paper focuses on the prediction of impact loading in composite structures as a function of time using a support vector regression (SVR) approach. A time delay embedding feature extraction scheme is used since it can characterize the dynamics of the impact using the sensor signal from the FBGs. The efficiency of this approach has been demonstrated on simulated composite plates and wing structures. Training with impacts at four locations with three different energies, the constructed framework is able to predict the force-time history at an unknown impact location to within 12 percent on the composite plate and to within 10 percent on a composite wing when the impact was within the sensor network region.

On Internal Knowledge Representation for Programming Mobile Robots by Demonstration	SOCIAL ROBOTICS, ICSR 2010	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR)	NOV 23-24, 2010	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Natl Univ Singapore, Interact Digital Media Inst (IDMI), Social Robot Lab (SRL), A STAR, Inst Infocomm Res (I2R), Human Language Technol Dept, Servo Dynam Private Ltd, Aldebaran Robot			HUMANOID ROBOT	Intuitive learning of new behaviours is one of the important aspects of social robotics. Among various robot learning approaches, recently Programming by Demonstration (PbD) has gained significant recognition with a lot of potential. Internal representation of the knowledge is a key design choice in the learning process. Using machine learning techniques such as ANNs, HMMs and NARMAX models, simple skills can be encoded from raw sensory data. However, the abstract symbolic representations have demonstrated greater potential for learning complicated tasks but with less details and require a piece of prior knowledge as well. For a particular application, appropriate choice of the symbols is a key design issue. This paper discusses the choice of the symbols to build a PbD process for typical indoor navigation. The learning results are presented for a few tasks to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.

Recent publications and developments based on SVM have shown that by using MKL one can enhance interpretability of the decision function and improve classifier performance, which motivates researchers to explore the use of homogeneous model obtained as linear combination of various types of kernels. In this paper, we show that MKL problems can be solved efficiently by modified projection gradient method and applied for image categorization and object detection. The kernel is defined as a linear combination of feature histogram function that can measure the degree of similarity of partial correspondence between feature sets for discriminative classification, which allows recognition robust to within-class variation, pose changes, and articulation. We evaluate our proposed framework on the ETH-80 dataset for several multi-level image encodings for supervised and unsupervised object recognition and report competitive results.

Recent work has shown that feature selection can have a positive affect on the performance of machine learning algorithms. The success of many learning algorithms in their attempts to construct models of data, hinges on the reliable identification of a small set of highly predictive attributes. The inclusion of irrelevant, redundant and noisy attributes in the model building process phase can result in poor predictive performance and increased computation. In this paper, a novel feature search procedure that utilizes combining of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and genetic algorithm (GA) is presented. The ACO is a meta-heuristic inspired by the behavior of real ants in their search for the shortest paths to food sources. It looks for optimal solutions by considering both local heuristics and previous knowledge. Genetic algorithm selects the best parameters for ant colony optimization in each step. When this algorithm applied to two different classification problems, the proposed algorithm achieved very promising results.

As a result, there has been a significant increase in the research area of Case Base Maintenance (CBM). This paper proposes a case-base maintenance method based on the machine-learning techniques, it is able to maintain the case bases by reducing its size and preserving maximum competence of the system. The main purpose of our method is to apply clustering analysis to a large case base and efficiently build natural clusters of cases which are smaller in size and can easily use simpler maintenance operations. For each cluster we reduce as much as possible, the size of the cluster.

The task of intrusion detection is to identify a network connecting record as representing a normal or abnormal behavior. This is a classification problem that can be addressed using machine learning techniques. Commonly used techniques include supervised learning such as Support Vector Machine classification (SVM) and unsupervised learning such as Clustering with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). In this paper, we described a new approach that combines SVM and ACO to take advantages of both approaches while overcome their drawbacks. We called the new method Combining Support Vectors with Ant Colony (CSVAC). Our experimental results on a benchmark data set show that the new approach was better than or at least comparable with pure SVM and pure ACO on the performance measures.

S	Lee, Y		Bang, H; Zhou, XK; Mazumdar, M; VanEpps, HL		Lee, Yoonkyung			Support Vector Machines for Classification: A Statistical Portrait	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY	Methods in Molecular Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Classification; machine learning; kernel methods; regularization; support vector machine	SELECTION; REGRESSION; CONSISTENCY; CANCER; PATH	The support vector machine is a supervised learning technique for classification increasingly used in many applications of data mining, engineering, and bioinformatics. This chapter aims to provide ail introduction to the method, covering from the basic concept of the optimal separating hyperplane to its nonlinear generalization through kernels. A general framework of kernel methods that encompass the support vector machine as a special case is outlined. In addition, statistical properties that illuminate both advantage and limitation of the method due to its specific mechanism for classification are briefly discussed. For illustration of the method and related practical issues, an application to real data with high-dimensional features is presented.

Such data sets can be mined to discover biomarkers and develop statistical models capable of predicting an endpoint of interest from data measured in the samples. The field of biomarker model development combines methods from statistics and machine learning to develop and evaluate predictive biomarker models. In this chapter, we discuss the computational steps involved in the development of biomarker models designed to predict information about individual samples and review approaches often used to implement each step. A practical example of biomarker model development in a large gene expression data set is presented. This example leverages BDVal, a suite of biomarker model development programs developed as an open-source project (see http://bdval.org/).

However the methods that use rejection suffer from the curse of dimensionality when the number of summary statistics is increased. Here we propose a machine-learning approach to the estimation of the posterior density by introducing two innovations. The new method fits a nonlinear conditional heteroscedastic regression of the parameter on the summary statistics, and then adaptively improves estimation using importance sampling. The new algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art approximate Bayesian methods, and achieves considerable reduction of the computational burden in two examples of inference in statistical genetics and in a queueing model.

The robust SVM is an improved version of the SVM so that the resulting classifier can be less sensitive to outliers. In many practical problems, it may be advantageous to use different weights for different types of misclassification. However, the existing RSVM treats different kinds of misclassification equally. In this paper, we propose the weighted RSVM, as an extension of the standard SVM. We show that surprisingly, the cost-based weights do not work well for weighted extensions of the RSVM. To solve this problem, we propose a novel utility-based weighting scheme for the weighted RSVM. Both theoretical and numerical studies are presented to investigate the performance of the proposed weighted multicategory RSVM.

In terms of complexity classes, this implies that BQP/qpoly subset of QMA/poly, which supersedes the previous result of Aaronson that BQP/qpoly subset of PP/poly. Indeed, we can exactly characterize quantum advice, as equivalent in power to untrusted quantum advice combined with trusted classical advice. Proving our main result requires combining a large number of previous tools-including a result of Alon et al. on learning of real-valued concept classes, a result of Aaronson on the learnability of quantum states, and a result of Aharonov and Regev on 'QMA(+) super-verifiers'-and also creating some new ones. The main new tool is a so-called majority-certificates lemma, which is related to boosting in machine learning, and which seems likely to find independent applications. In its simplest version, this lemma says the following. Given any set S of Boolean functions on n variables, any function f is an element of S can be expressed as the pointwise majority of m = O (n) functions f(1), ... , f(m) is an element of S, such that each f(i) is the unique function in S compatible with O (log vertical bar S vertical bar) input/output constraints.

This general class of model has enjoyed a huge and diverse range of applications, for example, speech processing, biomedical signal processing and more recently quantitative finance. However, a lesser known extension of this general class of model is the so-called Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM). FHMMs also have diverse applications, notably in machine learning, artificial intelligence and speech recognition [13, 17]. FHMMs extend the usual class of HMMs, by supposing the partially observed state process is a finite collection of distinct Markov chains, either statistically independent or dependent. There is also considerable current activity in applying collections of partially observed Markov chains to complex action recognition problems, see, for example, [6]. In this article we consider the Maximum Likelihood (ML) parameter estimation problem for FHMMs. Much of the extant literature concerning this problem presents parameter estimation schemes based on full data log-likelihood EM algorithms. This approach can be slow to converge and often imposes heavy demands on computer memory. The latter point is particularly relevant for the class of FHMMs where state space dimensions are relatively large. The contribution in this article is to develop new recursive formulae for a filter-based EM algorithm that can be implemented online. Our new formulae are equivalent ML estimators, however, these formulae are purely recursive and so, significantly reduce numerical complexity and memory requirements. A computer simulation is included to demonstrate the performance of our results.	[Malcolm, W.

B	Fuchs, A; Kirschner, A; Frishman, D		Frishman, D		Fuchs, Angelika; Kirschner, Andreas; Frishman, Dmitrij			Predicting residue and helix contacts in membrane proteins	STRUCTURAL BIOINFORMATICS OF MEMBRANE PROTEINS			English	Article; Book Chapter							SEQUENCE CONSERVATION PATTERNS; TRANSMEMBRANE ALPHA-HELICES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; KNOWLEDGE-BASED SCALE; AMINO-ACID-RESIDUES; SOLVENT ACCESSIBILITY; CORRELATED MUTATIONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIMERIZATION MOTIF; ASSOCIATION	Helix-helix contacts are an important feature of alpha-helical membrane proteins as they define their characteristic helix bundle structure. No bioinformatics approaches for the prediction of pairwise residue contacts in membrane proteins have existed until recently. In this chapter we describe novel contact prediction methods based on residue coevolution and machine learning techniques specifically geared towards membrane proteins. While contact prediction accuracies are limited to similar to 10% using co-evolving residues alone, machine learning methods are able to improve these accuracies significantly to more than 25% by using available membrane protein structures as a training dataset and incorporating membrane protein specific sequence features into the prediction process. Importantly, predicted residue contacts allow for identification of interacting transmembrane helices with high accuracy. As different membrane protein structures can be distinguished by their specific pattern of helix interactions, predicted residue contacts may not only serve as structural constraints in modeling experiments, but also constitute valuable information for structural classification of membrane proteins with unknown structure.

It extracts the meaningful objects information from low-level image features and provides the input for the further processing. There have been many techniques proposed over the decades. As a useful data analysis method in machine learning, clustering is a natural way for doing the grouping task. However, due to many complicated factors in natural images, such as noises and clutter in background, many clustering algorithms, which just use pairwise similarity measure, are not robust enough and always fail to generate grouping results that are consistent with the visual objects perceived by human. In this article, we present how the grouping performance is improved by utilizing multi-feature similarity under the information based clustering framework compared with other clustering methods using pairwise similarity.

These interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system. For example, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is the physical basis of multiple cellular functions. One goal of emerging systems biology is to analyze very large complex biological networks such as protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, and regulatory networks to identify functional modules and assign functions to certain components of the system. Network modules do not occur by chance, so identification of modules is likely to capture the biologically meaningful interactions in large-scale PPI data. Unfortunately, existing computer-based clustering methods developed to find those modules are either not so accurate or are too slow. We devised a new methodology called SCAN (Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks) that can efficiently find clusters or functional modules in complex biological networks as well as hubs and outliers. More specifically, we demonstrated that we can find functional modules in complex networks and classify nodes into various roles based on their structures. In this chapter, we show the effectiveness of our methodology using the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) PPI network. To validate our clustering results, we compared our clusters with the known functions of each protein. Our predicted functional modules achieved very high purity comparing with state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally the theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrated a linear running time of the algorithm, which is the fastest approach for networks. We compare our algorithm with well-known modularity-based clustering algorithm CNM. We successfully detect functional groups that are annotated with putative Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Top-10 clusters with minimum p-value theoretically prove that newly proposed algorithm partitions network more accurately then CNM. Furthermore, manual interpretations of functional groups found by SCAN show superior performance over CNM.

Although many approaches exist for reconstructing network structure, few approaches recover the full dynamic behavior of a network. We survey such approaches that originate from computational scientific discovery, a subfield of machine learning. These take as input measured time course data, as well as existing domain knowledge, such as partial knowledge of the network structure. We demonstrate the use of these approaches on illustrative tasks of finding the complete dynamics of biological networks, which include examples of rediscovering known networks and their dynamics, as well as examples of proposing models for unknown networks.

These two techniques in combination predict the direction (going up or not) of the close price of tomorrow's (day t+1) 'All Share Price Index' (ASPI) of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). The study period considered was from 1st November 2002 to 31st December 2008. The influential factors considered in this study represent the intermarket influence, political and environmental factors, economic stability and microeconomic factors: such as interest rate and exchange rate. A software called 'genetic model' was developed to find the optimum input variable combination that will affect the direction of tomorrow's ASPI value. Two identical neural network models called A and A were created for two different time periods, to predict the direction of ASPI of day (t+1).	[Dassanayake, M. M.

Different studies have concluded that the use of scientific terminology is one of the factors, which greatly influences the readability of this patient information. The present study deals with the problem of automatic term recognition of overly scientific terminology as a first step towards the replacement of the recognized scientific terms by their popular counterpart. In order to do so, we experimented with two approaches, a dictionary-based approach and a learning-based approach, which is trained on a rich feature vector. The research was conducted on a bilingual corpus of English and Dutch EPARs (European Public Assessment Report). Our results show that we can extract scientific terms with a high accuracy (> 80%, 10% below human performance) for both languages. Furthermore, we show that a lexicon-independent approach, which solely relies on orthographical and morphological information is the most powerful predictor of the scientific character of a given term.

However 90% for Labelled Attachment Score (LAS) seems to be a de facto limit for such kinds of parsers. Since generally such systems can not be modified, previous works have been developed to study what can be done with the training corpora in order to improve parsing accuracy. High level techniques, such as controlling sentences' length or corpora's size, seem useless for these purposes. But low level techniques, based on an in-depth study of the errors produced by the parser at the word level, seem promising. Prospective low level studies suggested the development of n-version parsers. Each one of these n versions should be able to tackle a specific kind of dependency parsing at the word level and the combined action of all them should reach more accurate parsings. In this paper we present an extensive study on the usefulness and the expected limits for n-version parser to improve parsing accuracy. This work has been developed specifically for Spanish using Maltparser.

Current approaches are mostly surface-oriented (or use only shallow syntactic representations) and see each text only as a token list. In this work however, we describe a deep, semantically oriented method based on semantic networks which are derived by a syntactico-semantic parser. Semantically identical or similar semantic networks for each sentence of a given base text are efficiently retrieved by using a specialized index. In order to detect many kinds of paraphrases the semantic networks of a candidate text are varied by applying inferences: lexico-semantic relations, relation axioms, and meaning postulates. Important phenomena occurring in difficult duplicates are discussed. The deep approach profits from background knowledge, whose acquisition from corpora is explained briefly. The deep duplicate recognizer is combined with two shallow duplicate recognizers in order to guarantee a high recall for texts which are not fully parsable.

In this paper, we report our works on temporal relation identification within the TimeML framework. We worked on TempEval-2007 Task B that involves identification of relations between events and document creation time. Two different systems, one based on machine learning and the other based on handcrafted rules, are developed. The machine learning system is based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) that makes use of only some of the features available in TimeBank corpus in order to infer temporal relations. The second system is developed using a set of manually constructed handcrafted rules. Evaluation results show that the rule-based system performs better compared to the machine learning based system with the precision, recall and F-score values 75.9%, 75.9% and 75.9%, respectively under the strict evaluation scheme and 77.1%, 77.1% and 77.1%, respectively under the relaxed evaluation scheme. In contrast, CRF based system yields precision, recall and F-score values 74.1%, 73.6% and 73.8%, respectively under the strict evaluation scheme and 75.1%, 74.6% and 74.8%, respectively under the relaxed evaluation scheme.

Comparison with the base lines algorithms based on the case of the first letter and a gazetteer is presented. The algorithm expressed 62% precision and 93% recall for the domain of the training data. Introduction of the simple hand-written post-processing rules increased precision up to 89%. We discuss also the problem of the method portability. A model of the combined knowledge sources is sketched also as a possible way to overcome the portability problem.

Speech synthesis of such special text requires some special components. First, an efficient diacritic reconstruction algorithm was applied. The accuracy of a former dictionary-based method was improved by machine learning to handle ambiguous cases properly. Second, an unlimited domain text-to-speech synthesizer was applied with extensions for emotional and spontaneous styles. Chat or blog texts often contain "emoticons" which mark the emotional state of the user. Therefore, an expressive speech synthesis method was adapted to a corpus-based synthesizer. Four emotions were generated and evaluated in a listening test: neutral, happy, angry and sad. The results of the experiments showed that happy and sad emotions can be generated with this algorithm, with best accuracy for female voice.

The paper describes how posterior machine learning can be modified by a priori machine learning. A priori and posterior machine learning algorithms are proposed for artificial neural network training and are tested in the task of audio-visual phoneme classification.

Genetic and metabolic information of the RILs served as predictors. Feature selection reduced the number of variables (genetic and metabolic markers) in the models by more than 80% without impairing the predictive power. Thus, potential biomarkers have been revealed. Metabolites were shown to bear information on inherited macroscopic phenotypes. This proof of concept could be interesting for breeders. The example population exhibits substantial mid-parent biomass heterosis. The results of feature selection could therefore be used to shed light on the origin of heterosis. In this respect, mainly dominance effects were detected.

This paradigm, which we will refer to as the Laplacian Paradigm, is built on a recent suite of nearly-linear time primitives in spectral graph theory developed by Spielman and Teng, especially their solver for linear systems Ax = b, where A is the Laplacian matrix of a weighted, undirected n-vertex graph and b is an n-place vector. In the Laplacian Paradigm for solving a problem (on a massive graph), we reduce the optimization or computational problem to one or multiple linear algebraic problems that can be solved efficiently by applying the nearly-linear time Laplacian solver. So far, the Laplacian paradigm already has some successes. It has been applied to obtain nearly-linear-time algorithms for applications in semi-supervised learning, image process, web-spam detection, eigenvalue approximation, and for solving elliptic finite element systems. It has also been used to design faster algorithms for generalized lossy flow computation and for random sampling of spanning trees. The goal of this presentation is to encourage more researchers to consider the use of the Laplacian Paradigm to develop faster algorithms for solving fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization (e.g., the computation of matchings, flows and cuts), in scientific computing (e.g., spectral approximation), in machine learning and data analysis (such as for web-spam detection and social network analysis), and in other applications that involve massive graphs.

There are three main types of recommender systems: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and demographic recommender systems. Collaborative filtering recommender systems recommend items by taking into account the taste (in terms of preferences of items) of users, under the assumption that users will be interested in items that users similar to them have rated highly. Content-based filtering recommender systems recommend items based on the textual information of an item, under the assumption that users will like similar items to the ones they liked before. Demographic recommender systems categorize users or items based on their personal attribute and make recommendation based on demographic categorizations. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. In this paper, we propose a unique cascading hybrid recommendation approach by combining the rating, feature, and demographic information about items. We empirically show that our approach outperforms the state of the art recommender system algorithms, and eliminates recorded problems with recommender systems.

We suggest a new approach to pest monitoring by using plant-driven information for assessing crop health in addition to detecting pests and damage symptoms. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can be considered as indicators of pest presence. The phenomenon is very well documented. We want to use this wealth of knowledge and put it into practice. New sensory technologies allow us to accurately measure these volatile chemicals. Environmental factors play a critical role on the emission of HIPVs. New pattern recognition and machine learning methods allow us to develop robust models that can account for all these factors.

Before beginning the ballad of development of this domain, it is important to get the stage set. This chapter explores the various concepts and terms used in computationally intelligent systems of today. We give a brief introduction to recognition systems, machine learning, expert systems and biometric identification. The major focus of the chapter is upon presenting the application of Soft Computing systems, the manner in which Soft Computing approaches contribute towards the application, and the various problems and issues that the application presents. These issues open gateways for a lot of research for the research community. While the sophisticated Soft Computing systems of today may be able to effectively solve a wide variety of problems, the data availability and computational constraints would always be a limitation for the flawless growth of the soft computing systems.

A major problem in the use of neural networks is that the architecture needs to be fixed. Further the training algorithm is needed to fix the various parameters. The training algorithm may many times give a suboptimal performance by getting trapped in local minima. In this chapter we make use of the optimization powers of the evolutionary algorithms and use them for the construction of the neural network. We would first present the application of evolutionary algorithms in setting the weights and biases of the neural networks. We later make use of evolutionary algorithms for fixing the architecture as well along with the weights and biases. Here we would describe a connectionist approach where the optimal connections evolve. We would also describe an incremental evolution technique in the same problem. We then make use of Grammatical Evolution for evolving the neural networks. At the end we give a similar treatment to the Fuzzy Systems as well.

Although several research works have reported accuracies over 90%, most network operators still use either obsolete (e.g., port-based) or extremely expensive (e.g., pattern matching) methods for traffic classification. We argue that one of the barriers to the real deployment of ML-based methods is their time-consuming training phase. In this paper, we revisit the viability of using the Nearest Neighbor technique for traffic classification. We present an efficient; implementation of this well-known technique based on multiple K-dimensional trees, which is characterized by short training times and high classification speed. This allows us not only to run the classifier online but also to continuously retrain it, without requiring human intervention, as the training data become obsolete. The proposed solution achieves very promising accuracy (> 95%) while looking just at the size of the very first packets of a flow. We present an implementation of this method based on the TIE classification engine as a feasible and simple solution for network operators.

In this paper, we indicated their limitations for reduct generation, then a new measure to knowledge was introduced to discuss the roughness of rough sets, and we developed an efficient algorithm for knowledge reduction based on rough sets. So, we modified the mean decision power, and proposed to use the algebraic definition of decision power. To select optimal attribute reduction, the judgment criterion of decision with an inequality was presented and some important conclusions were obtained. A complete algorithm for the attribute reduction was designed. Finally, through analyzing the given example, it is shown that the proposed heuristic information is better and more efficient than the others, and the presented method in the paper reduces time complexity and improves the performance. We report experimental results with several data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, and we compare the results with some other methods. The results prove that the proposed method is promising, which enlarges the application areas of rough sets.

This paper discusses a recently developed data-mining technique to predict motor vehicle crashes: the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique. MARS shows promising predictive power and does not suffer from a black-box limitation. Negative binomial (NB) and MARS models were fitted and compared with the use of extensive data collected on unsignalized intersections in Florida. Two models were estimated for rear-end crash frequency at three- and four-legged unsignalized intersections. Treatment of crash frequency as a continuous response variable to fit a MARS model was also examined by normalizing crash frequency with the natural logarithm of the annual average daily traffic. The combination of MARS with a machine learning technique (random forest) was explored and discussed. The significant factors that affected rear-end crashes were traffic volume on the major road, upstream and downstream distances to the nearest signalized intersection, median type on the major approach, land use at the intersection's influence area, and geographic location within the state. The study showed that MARS could predict crashes almost like the traditional NB models, and its goodness-of-fit performance was encouraging. The use of MARS to predict continuous response variables yielded more favorable results than its use to predict discrete response variables. The generated MARS models showed the most promising results after the covariates were screened by using random forest.

Many forecasting models have been developed for this purpose since the 1970s. Recently kernel-based machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) have gained special attention in traffic flow modeling and other time series analyses because of their outstanding generalization capability and superior nonlinear approximation. In this study, a novel kernel-based machine learning method, the Gaussian processes (GPs) model, was proposed to perform short-term traffic flow forecasting. This GP model was evaluated and compared with SVMs and autoregressive integrated moving average (AMNIA) models based on four sets of traffic volume data collected from three interstate highways in Seattle, Washington. The comparative results showed that the GP and SVM models consistently outperformed the ARIMA model. This study also showed that because the GP model is formulated in a full Bayesian framework, it can allow for explicit probabilistic interpretation of forecasting outputs. This capacity gives the GP an advantage over SVMs to model and forecast traffic flow.

One of the most common methods for data reduction is feature selection. but when we face large problems, the scalability becomes an issue This paper presents a way of removing this difficulty using several rounds of feature selection on subsets of the original dataset, combined using a voting scheme The performance is very good in terms of testing error and storage reduction, while the execution time of the process is decreased very significantly The method is especially efficient when we use feature selection algorithms that are of a high computational cost An extensive comparison in 27 datasets of medium and large sizes front the UCI Machine Learning Repository and using different classifiers shows the usefulness of our method.

The Modular Multi-Relational Framework (MMRF) is able to predict gene group functions. Since genes working together, it is focused on group functions rather than isolated gene functions. The approach of MMRF is flexible in several aspects, such as the kind of groups, the integration of different data sources, the organism and the knowledge representation. Besides, this framework takes advantages of the intrinsic relational structure of biological data, giving an easily biological interpretable and unique relational decision tree predicting N functions at once. This research work presents a group function prediction of S.cerevisiae (i.e. Yeast) genes grouped by protein complexes using MMRF. The results show that the predictions are restricted by the shortage of examples per class. Also, they assert that the knowledge representation is very determinant to exploit the available relational information richness, and therefore, to improve both the quantitative results and their biological interpretability.

This challenge is one of the first steps towards understanding how neural circuits contribute to the functional organization of the nervous system. In the cerebral cortex pyramidal neurons are key elements in brain function as they represent the most abundant cortical neuronal type and the main source of cortical excitatory synapses. Therefore, many researchers are interested in the analysis of the microanatomy of pyramidal cells since it constitutes an excellent tool for. better understanding cortical processing of information. Computational models of neuronal networks based on real cortical circuits have become useful tools for studying certain aspects of the functional organization of the neocortex. Neuronal morphologies (morphological models) represent key features in these functional models. For these purposes, synthetic or virtual dendritic trees call be generated through a morphological model of a given neuronal type based on real morphometric parameters obtained from intracellularly-filled single neurons. This paper presents a new method to construct virtual dendrites by means of sampling a branching model that represents the dendritic morphology. This method has been contrasted using complete basal dendrites from 3 74 layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the mouse neocortex.

The proposed procedure is based on regression techniques and on the use of a special type of probabilistic finite automata. The model is built in two stages. In the first stage, the most significant independent variable is detected, then observations are classified according to the value of this variable and regressions are re-run separately for each Group. The significant independent variables in each group are then discretized. The PEA is built with all tins information. In the second stage, the next value of the dependent; variable is predicted using an algorithm for short term forecasting which is based on the information stored in the PEA. An empirical application for global solar radiation data is also presented. The predictive performance of the procedure is compared to that of classical dynamic regression and a substantial improvement is achieved with our procedure.

The algorithm transforms each quantitative value of a feature into fuzzy sets of linguistic terms using membership functions and calculates the fuzzy lower and upper approximations. The membership functions are generated from cluster points generated by the subtractive clustering technique. A certain rule set based on fuzzy lower approximation and a possible rule set based on fuzzy upper approximation are generated. A genetic algorithm, based on iterative rule learning in combination with a boosting technique, is used to generate the possible rules. The proposed classifier is tested with three well known datasets from the UCI machine learning repository, and compared with relevant classification methods.

They exist a number of authors have applied genetic algorithms (GA) to the problem of K-clustering, where the required number of clusters is known. Various algorithms are used to enable the GAs to cluster and to enhance their performance, but there is little or no comparison between the different algorithms. It is not clear which algorithms are best suited to the clustering problem, or how any adaptions will affect GA performance for differing data sets. In this article we shall compare a number of algorithms of GA appropriate for the k-clustering problem with some distributions of the collections Reuters 21578, including some used for more general grouping problem.

Shoulder disorders are one of the most common musculoskeletal cases attended in primary health care services. Shoulder disorders cause pain and limit the ability to perform many routine activities and affect about 15-25% of the general population. Several clinical tests have been described to aid diagnosis of shoulder disorders. However, the current literature acknowledges a lack of concordance in clinical assessment, even among musculoskeletal specialists. In this work a Computer-Aided Decision Support (CADS) system for Shoulder Pain Pathology has been developed. The paper presents the medical method and the development of the database and the (CADS) system based on several classical classification paradigms improve by covariance estimation methods. Finally the system was evaluated by a medical specialist.	[Lopez de Ipina, K.; Hernandez, M.

This project intends to initiate the 'Center for excellence in e-Learning Sciences (CeeLS): i(4) future learning environment' at the National Taiwan Normal University. In collaboration with multiple leading institutes and universities involved in the areas of science education, computer science and computer engineering from around the world, NTNU proposes to develop an innovative science learning environment which integrates various modern technologies such as image processing, speech processing, automatic video processing, speech recognition, mobile technologies, machine translation, natural language processing, data mining and machine learning. Our aim is to create an intelligent classroom embedded with individualized and interactive learning materials and assessment tools. To realize the aforementioned goals, the CeeLS endeavors to bring together a group of experts in the area of science education, cognitive science, computer science, and computer engineering. We will propose three closely interrelated research directions conducted by three major projects: (1) Project Classroom 2.0, to establish this envisioned future classroom; (2) Project Mobile 2.0, to enhance the interactions among teacher, students, and student peers, and (3) Project Testing 2.0, to pioneer new technologies on assessment and to assist the CeeLS to carry out program evaluations for the project. Four major changes (in both cognitive and affective domains including students' domain knowledge, higher-order thinking ability and attitudes and motivation in the subject matters) will be investigated and evaluated under the innovative learning environment. The investigations will include: (1) Teachers' Teaching Approaches (TTA), (2) Students' Learning Strategies (SLS), (3) Student-Teacher Interactions (STI), and (4) Student Science Learning Outcomes (SLO).

However, people use a rich variety of terms to refer to their locations, such as "home," "Starbucks," or "the bus stop near my house." Our long-term goal is to create a system that can automatically generate appropriate place names based on real-time context and user preferences. As a first step, we analyze data from a two-week study involving 26 participants in two different cities, focusing on how people refer to places in location sharing. We derive a taxonomy of different place naming methods, and show that factors such as a person's perceived familiarity with a place and the entropy of that place (i.e. the variety of people who visit it) strongly influence the way people refer to it when interacting with others. We also present a machine learning model for predicting how people name places. Using our data, this model is able to predict the place naming method people choose with an average accuracy higher than 85%.

(ii) What time points in history are most useful to predict his future activities? and (iii) How difficult is it to predict his activity at a given time from another user's activity at another time?

Considering language specific knowledge, an adjusted Fujisaki model for Korean TTS system is introduced along with refined machine learning features. The results of quantitative and qualitative evaluations show the validity of our system: the accuracy of the phrase command prediction is 0.8928; the correlations of the predicted amplitudes of a phrase command and an accent command are 0.6644 and 0.6002, respectively; our method achieved the level of "fair" naturalness (3.6) in a MOS scale for generated F0 curves.

The gait of the user is captured with the motion capture system, which consists of tags attached to the body and sensors situated in the apartment. Position of the tags is acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine learning algorithms in order to identify the specific health problem. We propose novel features for training a machine learning classifier that classifies the user's gait into: i) normal, ii) with hemiplegia, iii) with Parkinson's disease, iv) with pain in the back and v) with pain in the leg. Results show that naive Bayes needs more tags and less noise to reach classification accuracy of 98 % than random forest for 99 %.

UBIQUITOUS KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY: CHALLENGES, TECHNIQUES, APPLICATIONS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Book Chapter							DRIFTING CONCEPTS	After a long period of neglect, on-line learning is re-emerging as an important topic in machine learning. On one hand, this is due to new applications involving data flows, the detection of, or adaption to, changing conditions and long-life learning. On the other hand, it is now apparent that the current statistical theory of learning, based on the independent and stationary distribution assumption, has reached its limits and must be completed or superseded to account for sequencing effects, and more generally, for the information carried by the evolution of the data generation process. This chapter first presents the current, still predominant paradigm. It then underlines the deviations to this framework introduced by new on-line learning settings, and the associated challenges that they raise both for devising novel algorithms and for developing a satisfactory new theory of learning. It concludes with a brief description of a new learning concept, called tracking, which may hint as to what could come off as algorithms and theoretical questions from looking anew to this all-pervading situation: never to stop learning.

When considering military applications, the imbalanced learning problem becomes much more critical because such skewed distributions normally carry the most interesting and critical information. This critical information is necessary to support the decision-making process in battlefield scenarios, such as anomaly or intrusion detection. The fundamental issue with imbalanced learning is the ability of imbalanced data to compromise the performance of standard learning algorithms, which assume balanced class distributions or equal misclassification penalty costs. Therefore, when presented with complex imbalanced data sets these algorithms may not be able to properly represent the distributive characteristics of the data. In this paper we present an empirical study of several popular imbalanced learning algorithms on an army relevant data set. Specifically we will conduct various experiments with SMOTE ( Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique), ADASYN ( Adaptive Synthetic Sampling), SMOTEBoost ( Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling in Boosting), and AdaCost (Misclassification Cost-Sensitive Boosting method) schemes. Detailed experimental settings and simulation results are presented in this work, and a brief discussion of future research opportunities/challenges is also presented.

In this work we seek to model user behaviors and determine key variables that affect search engine usage. In particular, we study the engine usage behavior of more than ten thousand users over a period of six months and use machine learning techniques to identify key trends in the usage of search engines and their relationship with user satisfaction. We also explore methods to determine indicators that are predictive of user trends and show that accurate predictive user models of search engine usage can be developed. Our findings have implications for users as well as search engine designers and marketers seeking to better understand and retain their users.

We examine the use of such a criteria-based user model separately in two representative recommendation tasks: news article recommendations and product recommendations. We ask the following: are there nonlinear interactions among the criteria; and should the models be personalized? We assume that that user ratings on each criterion are available, and use machine learning to infer a user model that combines these multiple ratings into a single overall rating. We found that the ratings of different criteria have a nonlinear interaction in some cases, for example, article novelty and subject relevance often interact. We also found that these interactions vary from user to user.

Constraint-based tutors differ from the tutors where gaming detectors have previously been developed on several dimensions: in particular, higher-level answers are assessed according to a larger number of finer-grained constraints, and feedback is split into levels rather than an entire help sequence being available at any time. Correspondingly, help abuse behaviors differ, including behaviors such as rapidly repeating the same answer or blank answers to elicit answers. We use text replay labeling in combination with educational data mining methods to create a gaming detector for SQL-Tutor, a popular constraint-based tutor. This detector assesses gaming at the level of multiple-submission sequences and is accurate both at identifying gaming within submission sequences and at identifying how much each student games the system. It achieves only limited success, however, at distinguishing different types of gaming behavior from each other.	[Baker, Ryan S. J.

This paper focuses on the longitudinal driving situations which are classified into five categories - car following, braking, free following, decelerating and stopping - and are referred to as driving states. Here, the model is assumed to be represented by a state flow diagram. Statistical machine learning of driver-vehicle-environment system model based on driving database is conducted by a discriminative modelling approach called boosting sequential labelling method.

Using the pairs of simple mean-variances values, our technique is able to reduce the complexity of Intra MB coding process with a negligible loss in PSNR. We present an alternate approach to address the classification problem which is equivalent to machine learning. Implementation results show that the proposed method reduces encoding time to about 20% of the reference implementation with average loss of 0.05 dB in PSNR.

As in MOUT scenarios threats usually arise from humans one important task is the robust detection of humans. Detection of humans in MOUT by image processing systems can be very challenging, e.g., due to complex outdoor scenes where humans have a weak contrast against the background or are partially occluded. Porikli et al. introduced covariance descriptors and showed their usefulness for human detection in complex scenes. However, these descriptors do not lie on a vector space and so well-known machine learning techniques need to be adapted to train covariance descriptor classifiers. We present a novel approach based on manifold learning that simplifies the classification of covariance descriptors. In this paper, we apply this approach for detecting humans. We describe our human detection method and evaluate the detector on benchmark data sets generated from real-world image sequences captured during MOUT exercises.

This paper proposes to learn a discriminating function to detect web spam by genetic programming. The evolution computation uses multi-populations composed of some small-scale individuals and combines the selected best individuals in every population to gain a possible best discriminating function. The experiments on WEBSPAM-UK2006 show that the approach can improve spam classification recall performance by 26%, F-measure performance by 11%, and accuracy performance by 4% compared with SVM.

The main contributions of our work are two-fold: First, given the usual structure of a news story, we propose a novel algorithm to extract topic sentences by stressing the importance of news headline; Second, we extract event facts (i.e. 5W1H) from these topic sentences by applying a rule-based method (verb-driven) and a supervised machine-learning method (SVM). This method significantly improves the predicate-argument structure used in Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) Event Extraction (EE) task by considering valency (dominant capacity to noun phrases) of a Chinese verb. Extensive experiments on ACE 2005 datasets confirm its effectiveness and it also shows a very high scalability, since we only consider the topic sentences and surface text features. Based on this method, we build a prototype system named Chinese News Fact Extractor (CNFE). CNFE is evaluated on a real world corpus containing 30,000 newspaper documents. Experiment results show that CNFE can extract event facts efficiently.

In most cases, it requires extensive elaboration of medical data repositories and tailoring of the corresponding results according to the medical setting under consideration. This tailoring should account for variations in diverse clinical settings. However, in any case, it has to be based on well-structured medical data patterns that provide exports with the necessary knowledge. Towards facilitating the overall task, this paper presents a computer-supported framework for the semi-automatic development or meaningful medical data patterns. The proposed framework comprises a novel hybrid methodology, which exploits decision trees features, and a web-based system that has been developed to accommodate this methodology.

The original RPM algorithm merges pairs of states of the prefix tree acceptor of the positive samples in a fixed order assuring consistency of the resulting automaton, which would get a over-generalization automaton. The proposals presented consist in the modification of RPNI algorithm by means of introducing heuristics about network feature that label merging states from the prefix tree acceptor to prevent state from merging excessively. Preliminary experiments done seem to show that the improvement over the original RPNI algorithm is more helpful for deriving the more general network protocol automaton.

Consumers form their judgements to service quality according to a variety of service aspects which may be mentioned in different Web reviews. The research challenge is how to extract service aspects from service related Web reviews for conducting automatic service quality evaluation. To address this problem, this paper proposes four different methods to extract service aspects. Two methods are unsupervised methods and the other two methods are supervised methods. In the first method, we use FP-tree to find frequent aspects. The second method is graph-based method. We employ state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as CRFs (Conditional Random Fields) and MLN (Markov Logic Network) to extract service aspects. Experimental results show graph-based method outperforms FP-tree method. We also find that MLN performs well compared to other three methods.

The ultimate goal deals with being able to instantaneously deploy new defense strategies when a new 0day attack is encountered, thanks to an autonomous cognitive system.

Our goal was to use automatic recognition of animal vocalizations to census the populations of native frogs and an invasive introduced species, the Cane Toad. This application falls within the large class of detection and classification applications based on acoustic signals, which also includes condition-based maintenance, vehicle classification, and in particular monitoring birds and animals. As most applications in this class, amphibian monitoring is challenging because it requires high frequency acoustic sampling (10 kHz), complex signal processing and calls for low cost and long-lived unattended system operation in a challenging environment, characterized by significant environment noise as well as flooding, extreme heat and humidity and occasional forest fires. These design and deployment challenges were addressed over several phases. An initial system addressed the challenges of weather-proof, unattended operation. Our second system focused on miniaturization and driving down system costs. Our final system enabled fast in-network frog classification at the motes themselves using compressed sensing. Our experience shows that compressed sensing works in practice and can be a powerful tool in developing and implementing not only cane toad monitoring applications, but other high rate sensing applications.

Simulation of direct vector control of induction machine (IM) drive on the rotor flux direction with composite model flux observer can improve electrical machine learning's of graduate and under graduated students. In the indirect vector control of IM, current reference values are used for the estimation angle of the rotor flux space vector (ARFSV), however using current reference values instead of current real values can decrease accuracy of ARFSV. In the direct vector control, current real values (current feedback) estimate ARFSV. The ARFSV estimation can be performed by the current model flux observer and voltage model flux observer. These observers have some restrictions. But The composite model reduces disadvantages of every individual ones. In fact, Simulation of the composite model is applied to induction machines to get results compare to the classical current and voltage models. The interesting point is that the composite model approach shows great advantages over those classic ones, i.e. speed control over the wide range of motor operation with enough short settling time. All these remarkable benefits support the application of composite model in ARFSV. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In recent times, data mining and machine learning have been subjected to extensive research in intrusion detection with emphasis on improving the accuracy of detection classifier. But selecting important features from input data lead to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection rates. In this paper, we presented the relevance of each feature in KDD '99 intrusion detection dataset to the detection of each class. Rough set degree of dependency and dependency ratio of each class were employed to determine the most discriminating features for each class. Empirical results show that seven features were not relevant in the detection of any class.

One of the drawbacks of these methods, is the necessity to know a precise model of the considered system in order to design an appropriate fault detection/diagnosis system. This strong assumption can not be fulfilled for all cases. Additionally, different models have to be defined for distinguishing different states of machines operation. Qualitative model-based methods and also signal-based methods avoid this problem due to their different principle concepts of modeling. This contribution deals with the idea of combining qualitative model-based methods using fuzzy logic and statistical methods describing signal properties. The desired goal is to design a condition monitoring system based on suitable available signals, related measurements experiments, and classifying information of the system to be monitored. The key idea of this contribution is the generation of a set of features to distinguish related different states of the system. For validation of the developed method, experimental data is used from a test rig to study friction and wear processes of a metal surface allowing the distinction of different wear states. The developed method shows good ability to distinct the related states of wear.

We also discuss the positive impact of this kind of soft vector quantization on the performance of machine-learning systems that include one or more vector quantization modules. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence on the advantage of avoiding over-fitting and boosting the robustness of such systems in the presence of considerable parasitic variance; e.g. noise, in the runtime inputs. The experiments have been conducted with two versions of one of the best reported discrete HMM-based Arabic OCR systems; one version deploying hard vector quantization and the other deploying our herein presented soft vector quantization. Test samples of real-life scanned pages are used to challenge both versions; hence the recognition error margins are compared.

For this problem, numerous methods and tools have been developed by adopting approaches such as objects segmentation, color feature analysis and machine learning e.g., Support Vector Machines(SVMS). But conversely, the difficulty of image orientation can be used to examine the robustness of a CAPTCHA(Completely Automated Public Turing test to Tell Computers and Human Apart). The automated image orientation problem previously only had been studied and solved using typical photos which almost include important semantic cues such as people, bright sky, dark ground and vertical edges. In this paper we propose a simple prototype CAPTCHA, which exploits the hardness of orienting sub-images cropped from a whole digital photo. Our CAPTCHA takes 8 sub-images from base-photos and rotates them randomly. Then we present them to the user, who is required to find the correct orientations of the 8 sub-images. The true orientation is easily obtained since most current high-end digital cameras have an automatic mechanism to store its orientation in EXIF. Thus we can simply and easily obtain the image orientation without applying complicated computation. For our experiment, we have collected about 1850 base photos that provide more than 100,000 different sub-images. Experiment showed that the accuracy of our CAPTCHA with humans is about 95%. We think this sub-image orientation is hard to solve by an automated procedure since all previous machine learning procedures have only considered whole photos with enough semantic cues, rather than partial image segments. Another advantage of our system is that user interaction is simpler(there arc four choices) and more intuitive than a common text-based system or the previous image orientation method with arbitrary rotation. Experiment showed that common users performed at most two rotations for each sub-image. The total time to complete orienting the 8 sub-image orientation was less than 15 seconds which is significantly shorter than that of previous image-based CAPTCHAs.

It is customary to cast the dialogue management problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and to find the associated optimal policy using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Yet, the dialogue state space is usually very large (even infinite) and standard RL algorithms fail to handle it. In this paper we explore the possibility of using a generalization framework for dialogue management which is a particular fitted value iteration algorithm (namely fitted-Q iteration). We show that fitted-Q, when applied to continuous state space dialogue management problems, can generalize well and makes efficient use of samples to learn the approximate optimal state-action value function. Our experimental results show that fitted-Q performs significantly better than the hand-coded policy and relatively better than the policy learned using least-square policy iteration (LSPI), another generalization algorithm.

If unintended stress patterns can be detected following unit selection, based on features available in the unit database, it may be possible to modify the units during waveform synthesis to correct errors and produce an acceptable stress pattern. In this paper, three machine learning algorithms were trained with acoustic measurements from natural utterances and corresponding stress patterns: CART, SVM and MaxEnt. Our experimental results showed that MaxEnt performs the best (83.3% for 3-syllable words, 88.7% for 4-syllable words correctly classified) in the natural stress pattern classification. Though classification rates are good, a large number of false alarms are produced. However, there is some indication that signal modifications based on false positives do little harm to the speech output.

This paper constitutes an extension to this approach; the underlying concept is to model context at the observations for HMMs with discrete observations and discrete probability distributions. The HMMs emit context-sensitive discrete observations and are evaluated with a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system.

However, at least two considerations argue for usage of phoneme class specific features for emotion recognition. First, there are well-known effects of phoneme class on some of these features. Second, it is plausible that emotion influences the speech signal in ways that differ between phoneme classes. A new method based on the concept of phoneme class specific features is proposed in which different features are selected for regions associated with different phoneme classes and then optimally combined, using machine learning algorithms. A small but significant improvement was found when this method was compared with an otherwise identical method in which features were used uniformly over different phoneme classes.

These experiments focus on improving the answer extraction step of the QA process. We present two approaches to answer extraction in question answering for speech corpora that apply machine learning to improve the coverage and precision of the extraction. The first one is a reranker that uses only lexical information, the second one uses dependency parsing to score robust similarity between syntactic structures. Our experimental results show that the proposed learning models improve our previous results using only hand-made ranking rules with small syntactic information. Moreover, this results show also that a dependency parser can be useful for speech transcripts even if it was trained with written text data from a news collection. We evaluate the system on manual transcripts of speech from EPPS English corpus and a set of questions transcribed from spontaneous oral questions. This data belongs to the CLEF 2009 track on QA on speech transcripts (QAst).

In this paper, we propose that smaller, prosodically defined units can be identified by tackling the problem on imbalanced prosodic unit boundary detection using five machine learning techniques. A parsimonious set of linguistically motivated prosodic features has been proven to be useful to characterize prosodic boundary information. Furthermore, BMPM is prone to have true positive rate on the minority class, i.e. the defined prosodic units. As a whole, the decision tree classifier, C4.5, reaches a more stable performance than the other algorithms.

Implementing control of this kind requires an accurate kinematic forward model. Despite debate about how to define the tasks for speech (i.e., acoustical vs. articulatory), a faithful forward model will be complex and infeasible to express analytically. Thus, it is necessary to learn the forward model from data. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have previously been suggested for this [3, 4, 6]. We argue for the use of locally-linear methods, such as Locally-Weighted Regression (LWR). While ANNs are capable of learning complex forward maps, LWR is more appropriate. Common formulations of control assume locally-linearity, whereas ANNs fit a nonlinear model to the entire map. Likewise, training LWR is simple compared to the complex optimization for ANNs. We provide an empirical comparison of these methods for learning a vocal tract forward model, discussing theoretical and practical aspects of each.

Although no coherent system with appropriate performance has been yet introduced to achieve this goal, some methods has been proposed to estimate the road or recognize objects on the road, which have been more based on thresholding and color-based object recognition; and therefore, their efficiencies have direct relationship and a lot of dependence with the type of input image. In this paper, a complete and coherent system has been introduced to detect traffic by using satellite images, in which a special attention is paid to extraction of the road and vehicles on the road by using image processing and machine learning (including feature extraction, morphology methods, and algorithms of labeling); and rate of road traffic is estimated by using the obtained results and by using neuro-fuzzy network. Previous works has been introduced in the paper; and finally, the obtained results have been compared with the past appropriate methods. Higher accuracy and less dependence on the input image is among the results that have been explained in detail in last section of the paper in which and results for various images from satellite show an accuracy of about 85%.

Knowledge of semantic labels of places can be used to effectively communicate with people and to develop efficient navigation solutions in complex environments. In this paper, we propose a new approach that enables a robot to learn and classify observations in an indoor environment using a labeled semantic grid map, which is similar to an Occupancy Grid like representation. Classification of the places based on data collected by laser range finder (LRF) is achieved through a machine learning approach, which implements logistic regression as a multi-class classifier. The classifier output is probabilistically fused using independent opinion pool strategy. Appealing experimental results are presented based on a data set gathered in various indoor scenarios.

Many software measurement and defect data sets are very skewed, where the proportion of not-fault-prone (majority class) modules is substantially larger than that of fault-prone (minority class) modules. Data sampling and Boosting (Boost) are useful techniques for alleviating this problem. While various Data Sampling techniques are available, our prior studies have shown Random Undersampling (RUS) to be effective. RUS works by randomly removing instances from the majority class of the training data. This paper investigates combining Data Sampling and Boosting (RUSBoost) for software defect prediction with skewed software measurement and defect data sets. We consider two variations of RUSBoost depending on the percentage of fault-prone modules desired in the post-sampling training data set. Labeled as RUSBoost_A and RUSBoost_B, they respectively represent whether 35% or 50% of the post-sampling training data set should be fault-prone modules. A case study of 15 data sets from multiple real-world projects is used to demonstrate that RUSBoost performs significantly better than a model built without any Data Sampling or Boosting technique. Moreover, RUSBoost_B significantly outperforms RUSBoost_A.

Usually, no neurophysiological knowledge is used within the classification algorithms. Here, a method is proposed that includes prior knowledge about the locations of sources of imagined movement of the left and the right hand by projecting EEG/MEG data onto a subspace defined by modeled sources at the corresponding locations in somatosensory areas. Three different source models are investigated. First, one radial dipole on each side is based on the assumption that both location and orientation are known. Hence, for two sides, a 2 subspace is selected. Second, three dipoles at each location span a 6-dimensional subspace assuming known locations but uncertain orientations. Third, we modeled the sources as multipoles up to quadrupolar order resulting in a 16-dimensional subspace. The multipole expansion systematically corrects for inaccuracies both in location and exact shape of the source. After the projection onto respective topographies, feature extraction is performed on the reduced data by Common Spatial Filter (CSP) analysis. Finally, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is applied for classification. The projection of the data leads to a reduction of the dimensionality of the signal focusing on those parts of the signal which are generated or suppressed in the motor cortex during imagined hand movement. Since EEG/MEG data are strongly affected by various types of artifacts hampering the classification the proposed procedure leads to a removal of parts of the signal and therefore a reduction of artifacts. For EEG data it is shown that a projection with respect to source locations prior to CSP analysis leads to a gain of BCI performance when the sources are modeled as multipoles.

Machine assisted histogram classification	17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP09)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	MAR 21-27, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					LHCb is one of the four major experiments under completion at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Monitoring the quality of the acquired data is important, because it allows the verification of the detector performance. Anomalies, such as missing values or unexpected distributions can be indicators of a malfunctioning detector, resulting in poor data quality. Spotting faulty or ageing components can be either done visually using instruments, such as the LHCb Histogram Presenter, or with the help of automated tools. In order to assist detector experts in handling the vast monitoring information resulting from the sheer size of the detector, we propose a graph based clustering tool combined with machine learning algorithm and demonstrate its use by processing histograms representing 2D hitmaps events. We prove the concept by detecting ion feedback events in the LHCb experiment's RICH subdetector.

The effect of the fragmentation problem in decision tree learning applied to the search for single top quark production	17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP09)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	MAR 21-27, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Decision tree learning constitutes a suitable approach to classification due to its ability to partition the variable space into regions of class-uniform events, while providing a structure amenable to interpretation, in contrast to other methods such as neural networks. But an inherent limitation of decision tree learning is the progressive lessening of the statistical support of the final classifier as clusters of single-class events are split on every partition, a problem known as the fragmentation problem. We describe a software system called DTFE, for Decision Tree Fragmentation Evaluator, that measures the degree of fragmentation caused by a decision tree learner on every event cluster. Clusters are found through a decomposition of the data using a technique known as Spectral Clustering. Each cluster is analyzed in terms of the number and type of partitions induced by the decision tree. Our domain of application lies on the search for single top quark production, a challenging problem due to large and similar backgrounds, low energetic signals, and low number of jets. The output of the machine-learning software tool consists of a series of statistics describing the degree of data fragmentation.

We present a scheme for predicting the performance of HPC applications based on the results of such benchmarks. A Genetic Algorithm approach is used to "learn" bandwidth as a function of cache hit rates per machine with MultiMAPS as the fitness test. The specific results are 56 individual performance predictions including 3 full-scale parallel applications run on 5 different modern HPC architectures, with various CPU counts and inputs, predicted within 10% average difference with respect to independently verified runtimes.

"Similar" patterns identification is also very important in biology because first, it is useful for prediction of patterns associated with disease, for example cancer tissue (normal or tumor); second, similarity or dissimilarity of the kinetic patterns is used to identify coordinately controlled genes or proteins involved in the same regulatory process. Third, similar genes (proteins) share similar functions. In this paper, we present an algorithm which uses genetic programming to create decision tree for binary classification problem. The application of the algorithm was implemented on five real biological databases. Base on the results of comparisons with well-known methods, we see that the algorithm is outstanding in most of cases.

Simultaneously, power densities have increased resulting in greater chances of thermal anomalies situations where the temperature at a location exceeds the safety threshold for equipment placed there. In this paper, we explore some techniques for predicting such thermal anomalies so that preemptive steps can be taken to address them. Four such techniques - a simple threshold method, a moving averages-based method, an EWMA-based method, and, a machine learning technique called naive Bayesian classifier - are tried on three months of temperature sensor data obtained from a real data center. The initial results are encouraging and the naive Bayes method performs better than the others, although the false positive rate needs to be improved.

Random forest generates decision trees by randomly selecting a limited number features from all available features for node splitting, and each tree cast a vote for the final decision. On the other hand, Adaboost tree is an iterative approach to improve the performance of a weak classifier by assigning weights to training samples, and incorrectly classified training samples will gain a larger weight in the process. We discuss the properties of these two tree-based ensemble methods and compare their classification performances in ecosystem classification. The results show that Adaboost tree can provide higher classification accuracy than random forest in multitemporal multisource dataset, while the latter could be more efficient in computation.

At times, new extracted features might be linear combinations of some primitive features that are not able to provide better classification accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose the integration of genetic programming and the expectation maximization algorithm (GP-EM) to automatically synthesize feature functions based on primitive input features for breast cancer detection. With the Gaussian mixture model, the proposed algorithm is able to perform nonlinear transformations of primitive feature vectors and data modeling simultaneously. Compared to the performance of other algorithms, such us the support vector machine, multi-layer perceptrons, inductive machine learning and logistic regression, which all used the entire primitive feature set, the proposed algorithm achieves a higher recognition rate by using one single synthesized feature function.

Automated image analysis of neuronal cells is essential for neuroscience research and is becoming a central component for quantifying the effect of candidate drugs on cells. To investigate the intricate nervous processes involved in many biological activities by computerized image analysis, accurate analysis and classification of neurites are prerequisite. In this paper, the fractal properties exhibited by neurons are further investigated and measures derived from multiresolution fractal analysis are exploited in differentiating neuron types by machine learning methods.

The focus of our work is to develop a human-robot communication system that is not easily detectable and increases stealth when necessary. The human-robot interaction system we propose involves hand signals. Hand gestures are a common modality of communication humans use with each other. Likewise, hand commands are used by the Marine Corps to convey information to each other without speaking. We analyze common Marine gestures so that similar commands can be used to direct a robot out in the field. In this paper, we have selected important hand or body gestures used by the Marine Corps. We then identify distinguishable features for the different gestures. This includes position of joint variables as well as velocity and acceleration terms. Once ideal models of the gestures are designed, experimental data is gathered. Presently, we are comparing two different machine learning methods that can be used to identify a specific gesture. The two methods we are comparing are Bayesian networks and neural networks. This paper provides the background and structure of our experiments. Then, both models are discussed and experimental results are included. Finally, we make a comparison of the effectiveness of the two methods of interest.

Vowels were classified based on movement patterns (rather than on derived articulatory features, e. g., lip opening) using a machine learning approach. Recognition accuracy on a single-speaker dataset was 94.02% with a very short latency. Recognition accuracy was better for high vowels than for low vowels. This finding parallels previous empirical findings on tongue movements during vowels. The recognition algorithm was then used to drive an articulation-to-acoustics synthesizer. The synthesizer recognizes vowels from continuous input stream of tongue and lip movements and plays the corresponding sound samples in near real-time.

Then the paper also establishes a classifying and clustering method with features of classification and clustering by designing and constructing the two-dimensional analytic indexes of similarities and differences between field texts. This method is designed for field texts because it is quite suitable for effective machine learning and can extend the text data and textual categories dynamically in real-time. Meantime, it solves the single-label classification and multi-label classification issues at one time, overcoming the defects of previous text classifying methods which can only expand data instead of capacity. The general text clustering methods have many defects: they are not suitable for high-dimensional data sets or large data sets; they don't have the text data and category expanding function and they can not handle the outlier data problem well. On the contrary, this new method can offer solutions to these defects. According to this method, the corresponding algorithm has been established and the effectiveness of the method has been proven by the experiment on the data sets of laws and regulations of construction industry in Shaanxi Province in China.

The method exploits the average difference between the gray level values of the pixels in 2x2 blocks of non-overlapping spatially and their mean gray level in order to select valid blocks for embedding. The method was tested on different gray scale images. Results show that our proposed approach provides larger embedding capacity, while being less detectable by steganalysis methods such as chi 2 attack and machine learning steganalysis systems, as compared to some well-known adaptive and non-adaptive steganography algorithms.

Thus communication protocols in BASN need to be energy efficient. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a Minimum Energy Packet Forwarding Protocol (MEPF). First, we analyze the trade-off of energy consumption between lower transmission power and packet retransmission. Then we propose the transmission power control part of MEPF. It transmits a packet using the minimum transmission power that can guarantee a high packet reception rate. Unlike the previous work, we not only need to adjust the power of the forward transmission but also the ACKs, which further reduces the consumption. MEPF outstands from the earlier works by also retransmitting lost packets when a link is good enough. The quality of the link is dynamically judged by a machine learning algorithm which also considers the limited buffer space in a sensor node. By MEPF, the energy consumption to forward a packet is minimized without sacrificing the packet reception ratio. Experimental results show quantitatively that MEPF save significant amounts of energy.

We present a new automated method, that combines intensity based lesion segmentation with a false positive elimination method based on the spatial distribution of lesions. A Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is trained on expert-defined lesion masks using image histograms as features, in order to obtain an initial lesion segmentation. A lesion probability map that represents the spatial distribution of true and false positives on the intensity based segmentation is constructed using the segmented lesions and manual masks. A k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier based on the lesion probability map is applied to refine the segmentation.

Based on an approach we have developed previously, we investigate combining machine learning techniques and hybrid image statistics for probabilistic branching node inference, using adaptive boosting as a probabilistic inference framework. Then, we use local image statistics at different image scales for feature representation, including the Harris cornerness, Laplacian, eigenvalues of the Hessian, and Harralick texture features. The proposed approach is applied to a breast imaging dataset consisting of 30 images, 7 of which were previously reported. The use of boosting and the Harralick texture feature further improves upon our previous results, highlighting the role of texture in the analysis of the breast ducts and other branching structures.

As a result, traditional image analysis relying on the explicit encoding of prior knowledge such as perceptual grouping, variational or generative approaches is usually not enough to capture the complex appearance of ultrasound data. We will discuss a new class of methods that build on recent advances in discriminative machine learning to achieve robust and efficient performance. Image analysis is formulated as a multi-scale learning problem through which object models of increasing complexity are progressively learned. We will demonstrate example applications in Cardiology and OB/GYN.

SHAPE-BASED SEMI-AUTOMATIC HIPPOCAMPAL SUBFIELD SEGMENTATION WITH LEARNING-BASED BIAS REMOVAL	2010 7TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING: FROM NANO TO MACRO	IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging		English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	APR 14-17, 2010	Rotterdam, NETHERLANDS	IEEE, Engn Med Biol Soc, Signal Processing Soc		hippocampus; subfield; bias correction	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE	We develop a semi-automatic technique for segmentation of hippocampal subfields in T2-weighted in vivo brain MRI. The technique takes the binary segmentation of the whole hippocampus as input, and automatically labels the subfields inside the hippocampus segmentation. Shape priors for the hippocampal subfields are generated from shape-based normalization of whole hippocampi via the continuous medial representation method. To combine the shape priors with appearance features, we use a machine learning based method. The key novelty is that we treat the mistakes made by the shape priors as bias, which can be detected and corrected via learning. The main advantage of this formulation is that it significantly simplifies the learning problem by taking full advantage of current segmentations and focusing on only improving their drawbacks. Experiments show that the bias removal approach achieves significant improvement in all subfields. Our bias removal idea is general, and can be applied to improve other segmentation methods as well.

In this paper we propose a novel approach for the segmentation of curvilinear structures in these images. The main challenge to be addressed is the lack of visual support due to the low SNR where traditional edge-based methods fail. Our approach combines machine learning techniques, unsupervised clustering and linear programming. In particular, numerous invariant to position/rotation classifiers are combined to detect candidate pixels of curvilinear structure. These candidates are grouped into consistent geometric segments through the use of a state-of-the art unsupervised clustering algorithm. The complete curvilinear structure is obtained through an ordering of these segments using the elastica model in a linear programming framework. Very promising results were obtained on guide wire segmentation in fluoroscopic images.

In order to perform comprehensive analysis of all protein location patterns, automated methods are needed. With the goal of extending automated subcellular location pattern analysis methods to high resolution images of tissues, 3D confocal microscope images of polarized CaCo2 cells immunostained for various proteins were collected. A three-color staining protocol was developed that permits parallel imaging of proteins of interest as well as DNA and the actin cytoskeleton. The collection is composed of 11 to 21 images for each of the 9 proteins that depict major subcellular patterns. A classifier was trained to recognize the subcellular location pattern of segmented cells with an accuracy of 89.2%. Using the Prior Updating method allowed improvement of this accuracy to 99.6%. This study demonstrates the benefit of using a graphical model approach for improving the pattern classification in tissue images.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for metric learning, aiming to address highly non functional correspondences through the integration of statistical regression and multi-label classification. We developed a position-invariant method that models the variations of intensities through the use of linear combinations of kernels that are able to handle intensity shifts. Such transport functions are considered as the singleton potentials of a Markov Random Field (MRF) where pair-wise connections encode smoothness as well as prior knowledge through a local neighborhood system. We use recent advances in the field of discrete optimization towards recovering the lowest potential of the designed cost function. Promising results on real data demonstrate the potentials of our approach.

In this paper we show that SLAM initialized with a known vehicle pose can be considered as a problem of parameter identification. Using a rank test for nonlinear map state identification, we establish that all the map states in the SLAM problem are identifiable given the initial conditions of the vehicle pose with zero uncertainty. We compare and contrast the nonlinear observability of the SLAM problem with its nonlinear parameter identification characteristics. We also show using the linear single dimensional SLAM problem formulation and closed form solutions that, given the initial conditions of the vehicle state with no uncertainty, the map states are identifiable. Furthermore, we show that the map states are not identifiable if the initial conditions are not known. We also present simulation and experimental results to corroborate the theoretical results. We propose that it is possible to use machine learning techniques in SLAM in view of the new parameter identifiability perspective.	[Perera, L. D.

Scalability has become a necessity for data mining algorithms to process large data more effectively and extract insightful information from large data. In this paper a scaling up neural network learning algorithm is presented, which partitions a large data set into subsets, applies learning algorithm on each subset concurrently and then integrates the learned results. We proved that the scaling up neural network is equivalent to a neural network which adds a penalty term to the error function for controlling the bias and variance. The algorithm was evaluated using the large dataset from UCI repository.

The multi-label learning model can predict one or more labels for a test instance. PT5 is a effective method to solving multi-label learning problem, it is critical to set an optimal threshold in this method. More error labels will be predicted if a lower threshold was set, and the labels will be predicted not entire if a big threshold was set. In this paper, a new algorithm TFEL (Threshold for Each Label) is proposed. An optimal threshold will be set for each label by learning from the training data set. When the score for a test instance to one label is bigger then threshold which is set for the label, the label will be added to the last classifying result for the test instance. The experiments results show that the TFEL method can get a well performance on classifying multi-label data set.

This paper discussed the randomized algorithm of its sub problem which requires that each divided subset size has to be at least some given value. First a sample set was drawn at random from the given point, which contains some number of points of each optimal subset with high probability. Based on the sample set, this paper presented a randomized (1+epsilon)-approximate algorithm for k-means clustering. At last, the running time and the successful probability of this randomized algorithm were analysed in this paper.

This paper presents a kind of system of the Web association rules mining based on genetic algorithm, which proves by experiment that it can mend the traditional Web association mining method of lack of foreseeing in latency. And it puts forward a new ideal of Web association rules mining.

To deal with such situation, in this paper a fundamental framework is proposed to fully describe the generation process of policies in pervasive computing applications. Furthermore, the collaborative filtering algorithms based on cosine vector are utilized to calculate characteristic similarity and classic similarity to aggregate the user identity similarity. The machine learning algorithm is adopted to generate the policies which will be recommended to the users. By utilizing the recommended policies, the users can finish the system policies setting process in a more quick and accurate way.

In regard to these problems, a new clustering method was discussed along with two parameters introduced assessing clustering effect. The new approach addressed these problems by adopting different methods. It deleted dimension traps by using learning rate for autonomous learning. The application of Distance Seeking based on Consistency and DB Index identified initially its center and the number of clustering units. Average of DB Index and DB quadratic mean deviation of DB Index assessed clustering effect. The findings tested the typical UCI Machine Learning Data Set and Data Set of high-dimensional industrial authenticity. The findings prove the efficiency of the new approach in a broad scale. The two parameters confirm the effect of the clustering.

We investigate the presence of several linguistic units used in text-to-speech systems, from phonemes to words. The text corpus we used, News-Romanian (News-RO) comprises 4500 newspaper articles. A subset of it, around 2500 sentences represents the Romanian Speech Synthesis (RSS) recorded speech database. The results offer an important insight to how should a speech database be designed. We also describe the methods used in the development of a 50,000 words Romanian lexicon with phonetic transcription and accent positioning. Such a lexicon is useful in machine learning algorithms of the front-end part of a text-to-speech system. As an addition we study the use of Maximal Onset Principle for Romanian syllabification.

We have developed an approach that tries to automatically create this semantic awareness based on developers' interactions with the programming environment, which is extended to log these interactions and allow the developers to train or supervise the algorithm by explicitly indicating they are having difficulty.

We define an additive abelian group for a slightly restricted set of probabilistic machines, and the group sum is used to formulate pattern-specific semantic annihilators. The annihilators attempt to identify pre-specified patterns via removal of inter-symbol correlations from observed sequences, thereby turning them into symbolic white noise. Thus a perfect annihilation corresponds to a pattern match. This approach of classification via information annihilation is shown to be strictly advantageous, with theoretical guarantees, for a large class of PFSA models. The results are supported by simulation experiments.			ixc128@psu.edu; axr2@psu.edu					ANGLUIN D, 1983, COMPUT SURV, V15, P237; Berman A., 1994, NONNEGATIVE MATRICES; Chattopadhyay I, 2008, INT J CONTROL, V81, P820, DOI 10.1080/00207170701704746; CRUTCHFIELD JP, 1989, PHYS REV LETT, V63, P105, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.63.105; HECKERMAN D, 1994, MSRTR9502; Hopcroft J.E., 2001, INTRO AUTOMATA THEOR; JELINEK F, 1992, SPEECH RECOGNITION F, V75, P35; MURPHY K, 1996, PASSIVELY LEARNING F; Pearl J., 1988, PROBABILISTIC REASON; Rabiner L., 1989, TUTORIAL HIDDEN MARK, V77, P257; Rajagopalan V, 2006, SIGNAL PROCESS, V86, P3309, DOI 10.1016/j.sigpro.2006.01.014; Rudin W., 1988, REAL COMPLEX ANAL; Shalizi C., 2004, AUAI 04, P504	13	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	0743-1619	978-1-4244-7427-1	P AMER CONTR CONF			2010							492	497				6	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering	BTK95	WOS:000287187900081	
S	Mohan, K; Fazel, M			IEEE	Mohan, Karthik; Fazel, Maryam			Reweighted Nuclear Norm Minimization with Application to System Identification	2010 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference	JUN 30-JUL 02, 2010	Baltimore, MD					The matrix rank minimization problem consists of finding a matrix of minimum rank that satisfies given convex constraints. It is NP-hard in general and has applications in control, system identification, and machine learning. Reweighted trace minimization has been considered as an iterative heuristic for this problem. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of this iterative heuristic, showing that the difference between successive iterates tends to zero. Then, after reformulating the heuristic as reweighted nuclear norm minimization, we propose an efficient gradient-based implementation that takes advantage of the new formulation and opens the way to solving large-scale problems. We apply this algorithm to the problem of low-order system identification from input-output data. Numerical examples demonstrate that the reweighted nuclear norm minimization makes model order selection easier and results in lower order models compared to nuclear norm minimization without weights.

We make use of one on-body inertial measurement unit (IMU) to automate the functional ability (FA) scoring of the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). WMFT is an assessment instrument used to determine the functional motor capabilities of individuals post stroke. It is comprised of 1 7 tasks, 1 5 of which are rated according to performance time and quality of motion. We present signal processing and machine learning tools to estimate the WMFT FA scores of the 1 5 tasks using IMU data.

We present a novel algorithm for the detection of individual heart beats in ballistocardiograms (BCGs). In a training step, unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify the shape of a single heart beat in the BCG. The learned parameters are combined with so-called "heart valve components" to detect the occurrence of individual heart beats in the signal. A refinement step improves the accuracy of the estimated beat-to-beat interval lengths. Compared to other algorithms this new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis and is designed to cope with arrhythmias. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in laboratory and home settings for its agreement with an ECG reference. A beat-to-beat interval error of 14.16 ms with a coverage of 96.87% was achieved. Averaged over 10 s long epochs, the mean heart rate error was 0.39 bpm.

Motion capture system, which consists of tags attached to the body and sensors situated in the apartment, is used to capture gait of elderly. Position of the tags is acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine learning algorithms in order to recognize the specific health problem. We propose novel features for training a machine learning classifier that classifies the user's gait into four health problems and a normal health state. Results showed that decision tree classifier was able to reach 95% of classification accuracy using 7 tags and 5 mm standard deviation of noise. Neural network outperformed it with classification accuracy over 99% using 8 tags with 0-20 mm noise. Control panel prototype has been developed to provide explanation of the automatic diagnosis.

However, robust detection of human vigilance from EEG is very difficult due to the low SNR nature of EEG signals. Recently, compressive sensing and sparse representation become successful tools in the fields of signal reconstruction and machine learning. In this paper, we propose to use the sparse representation of EEG to the vigilance detection problem. We first use continuous wavelet transform to extract the rhythm features of EEG data, and then employ the sparse representation method to the wavelet transform coefficients. We collect five subjects' EEG recordings in a simulation driving environment and apply the proposed method to detect the vigilance of the subjects. The experimental results show that the algorithm framework proposed in this paper can successfully estimate driver's vigilance with the average accuracy about 94.22 %. We also compare our algorithm framework with other vigilance estimation methods using different feature extraction and classifier selection approaches, the result shows that the proposed method has obvious advantages in the classification accuracy.

An experimental mammography digital repository of approximately 300 mammograms from the MIAS database was created and classifiers were built achieving a 0.85 average area under the ROC curve in a dataset of 100 selected mammograms with representative pathological lesions and normal cases. Similar results were achieved with classifiers built for the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (699 features vectors). Now these technologies are being validated in a real medical environment at the Faculty of Medicine in Porto University after a process of integrating the tools within the clinicians workflows and IT systems.

First, a large collection of candidate features, mostly consisting of various statistical quantities, are calculated from the subject's EEG. This large set of candidate features is then reduced into a much smaller set of most relevant features using a feature selection procedure. The selected features are then used to evaluate the class likelihoods, through the use of a mixture of factor analysis (MFA) statistical model [7]. In a training set of 207 subjects, including 64 subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), 40 subjects with chronic schizophrenia, 12 subjects with bipolar depression and 91 normal or healthy subjects, the average correct diagnosis rate attained using the proposed method is over 85%, as determined by various cross-validation experiments. The promise is that, with further development, the proposed methodology could serve as a valuable adjunctive tool for the medical practitioner.

Those methods are developed for a computer system supporting the decision making process for early diagnosis of melanoma. Symbolic (machine) learning methods used in our study are tested on two types of features extracted from pigmented lesion images: coloristic/geometric features, and wavelet-based features. Classification performance with the wavelet features, although achieved with simple rules, is very high. Symbolic learning applied to our skin lesion data seems to outperform other classical machine learning methods, and is more comprehensive both in understanding, and in application of further improvements.

While significant progress has been made, serious challenges remain to be addressed from both biological and engineering perspectives. A key issue is how to optimize the decoding of neural information, such that neural signals are correctly mapped to effectors that interact with the outside world - like robotic hands and limbs or the patient's own muscles. Here we present some recent progress on tackling this problem by applying the latest developments in machine learning. Neural data was collected from macaque monkeys performing a real-time hand grasp decoding task. Signals were recorded via chronically implanted electrodes in the anterior intraparietal cortex (AIP) and ventral premotor cortex (F5), brain areas that are known to be involved in the transformation of visual signals into hand grasping instructions. We present a comparative study of different classical machine learning methods with an application of decoding of hand postures, as well as a new approach for more robust decoding. Results suggests that combining data-driven algorithmic approaches with well-known parametric methods could lead to better performing and more robust learners, which may have direct implications for future clinical devices.

A machine learning based method for classification of fractal features of forearm sEMG using Twin Support Vector Machines	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			EMG; DIMENSION; SIGNALS	Classification of surface electromyogram (sEMG) signal is important for various applications such as prosthetic control and human computer interface. Surface EMG provides a better insight into the strength of muscle contraction which can be used as control signal for different applications. Due to the various interference between different muscle activities, it is difficult to identify movements using sEMG during low-level flexions. A new set of fractal features - fractal dimension and Maximum fractal length of sEMG has been previously reported by the authors. These features measure the complexity and strength of the muscle contraction during the low-level finger flexions. In order to classify and identify the low-level finger flexions using these features based on the fractal properties, a recently developed machine learning based classifier, Twin Support vector machines (TSVM) has been proposed. TSVM works on basic learning methodology and solves the classification tasks as two SVMs for each classes. This paper reports the novel method on the machine learning based classification of fractal features of sEMG using the Twin Support vector machines. The training and testing was performed using two different kernel functions - Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF).	[Arjunan, S. P.; Kumar, D. K.; Naik, G.

To address this challenge, we propose a machine learning (ML) methodology to predict the response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication in subjects suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), using pre-treatment electroencephalograph (EEG) measurements. The proposed feature selection technique is a modification of the method of Peng et al [10] that is based on a Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance measure. The classifier was realized as a kernelized partial least squares regression procedure, whose output is the predicted response. A low-dimensional kernelized principal component representation of the feature space was used for the purposes of visualization and clustering analysis. The overall method was evaluated using an 11-fold nested cross-validation procedure for which over 85% average prediction performance is obtained. The results indicate that ML methods hold considerable promise in predicting the efficacy of SSRI antidepressant therapy for major depression.

Recent progress applying a constantly expanding set of sophisticated statistical tools and mathematical techniques suggests the emergence of a new type of measurement-based networking research that could benefit from a more principled approach for representing, analyzing, and modeling data collected from tomorrow's Internet or other multi-layered communication networks. To this end, we discuss a structured approach to Internet data representation and modeling that provides a framework for systematically applying tools from statistical analysis, signal processing or machine learning, and techniques from mathematical modeling. By respecting the multi-scale (in time, space, and layers) nature of the data, the proposed approach offers critical insights into a number of challenging network research problems. We illustrate the approach with two concrete examples and compare it with alternatives that are based on recent advances in the theory of complex networks.

The majority of existing machine learning methods are based on the inductive learning paradigm, where a labeled training set (one label per training example) trains a classifier which is markedly different from the human learning experience, where any one object can take multiple labels (i.e. a dog is a dog, but it is also an animal and a living object). As a result, we propose a framework whereby the classification problem is a special case of the more general categorization problem. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised algorithm that can incorporate data with multiple labels drawn from a hierarchy to learn a categorical representation. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to learn the underlying hierarchy and to generalize to data outside of the training set. We validate the efficacy of the algorithm by training on a dataset of faces and testing the hierarchy on other images of faces.

Due to the inherent physical characteristics of systems under investigation, non-negativity is a desired constraint that must be imposed on the system parameters in some real-life phenomena sensing tasks. In this paper, we propose a kernel-based machine learning strategy to deal with regression problems. Multiplicative update rules are derived in this context to ensure the non-negativity constraints to be satisfied. Considering the tight energy and bandwidth resource, a distributed algorithm which requires only communication between neighbors is presented. Synthetic data managed by heat diffusion equations are used to test the algorithms and illustrate their tracking capacity.

Previous approaches, which have varied from transient analysis to machine learning, do not provide verifiable accuracy. Here, we detail a first step toward a model-based approach. In particular we exploit differences in nonlinearities of input/output (I/O) characteristics of power amplifiers modeled with Volterra series and develop algorithms for deciding the origin of a given message of interest based on these differences. We consider a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and a classical likelihood ratio test. For both tests, decision rules are derived and their performance is analyzed. Finally, to establish the viability of the proposed approach, the practical variations among power amplifiers are investigated through simulations and measurements. Results show that the methods can be very effective, when exploiting imperfections of commercially used RF power amplifiers (PAs).

In the first approach, stand-alone femtocells choose their strategies, observe the behavior of other players, and make the best decision based on their instantaneous payoff, as well as the average payoff of all other femtocells. We formulate the interactions among selfish femtocells using evolutionary games and demonstrate how the system converges to an equilibrium. In contrast, in the Reinforcement-Learning (RL) approach, information exchange among femtocells is no longer possible and hence each femtocell adapts its strategy and gradually learns by interacting with its environment (i.e., neighboring interferers) through trials-and-errors. Our investigations reveal that through learning, femtocells are able to self-organize by relying only on local information, while mitigating the interference towards the macrocell network. Besides, a trade-off exists where faster convergence is obtained in the evolutionary case as compared to the RL approach, at the expense of more side information. Finally, it is shown that femtocells face an interesting tradeoff of exploration versus exploitation in their learning processes.

This makes H.264/AVC very difficult to implement, especially for real time applications and mobile devices. The current technological challenge is to conserve the compression capacity and quality that H.264 offers but reduce the encoding time and, therefore, the processing complexity. This paper applies machine learning technique for video encoding mode decisions and investigates ways to improve the process of generating more general low complexity H.264/AVC video encoders. The proposed H.264 encoding method decreases the complexity in the mode decision inside the Inter frames. Results show, in a 67.81% average reduction of complexity and 0.2 average decreases in PSNR and an average bit rate increase of 0.04% for different kinds of videos and formats.

We replace the complex mode-decision calculations by a classifier which has been trained specifically to minimize the reduction in RD performance. This results in a significant speedup in encoding. The results show that machine learning has a great potential and can reduce the complexity substantially with negligible impact on quality. The results show that the proposed method reduces encoding time to about 70% in base layer and up to 50% in enhancement layer of the reference implementation with a negligible loss in quality.

In this paper, the algorithm of eye location with the Accuracy-Weighted Principal Component Analysis (AWPCA) is proposed grounded on the idea of machine learning. Firstly, the appropriate eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the set of eyes images are selected by comparing the value of the classification accuracy. Secondly, the threshold for the classifier is determined by using the selected eigenvectors and the accuracy. Lastly, the unknown image region is projected into the selected eigenvectors having the largest accuracy, and the absolute values of the projection coefficients and the corresponding accuracy can be expressed as the total sum of products, which is compared with the threshold to determine whether the unknown region contains the human eye. The algorithm is called the AWPCA because the projection coefficient is multiplied by the accuracy. The performance of our automatic eye location technique is subsequently validated by using the CAS-PEAL database. The experiment results show that the AWPCA algorithm may locate eye more effectively than the original PCA algorithm based on the reconstruction error, especially for the face images with glasses.

In this paper, we propose a statistical machine learning based approach to achieve session slowdown guarantees of a multi-tier Internet service. Session slowdown is the ratio of a session's total queueing delay to its total processing time. It is a compelling performance metric of session-based Internet services because it directly measures user-perceived relative performance. However, there is no analytical model for session slowdown on multi-tier servers. We first conduct training to learn the statistical regression models that quantitatively capture an Internet service's dynamic behavior as relationships between various service parameters. Then, we propose a dynamic resource provisioning approach that utilizes the learned regression models to efficiently achieve session slowdown guarantees under varying workloads. The approach is based on the combination of extensive offline training and online monitoring of the Internet service behavior. Experiments using the industry standard TPC-W benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the regression based dynamic resource provisioning approach in meeting the session slowdown guarantees of a multi-tier e-commerce application.

However, despite major progress, the general question of polynomial learnability of Gaussian mixture distributions still remained open. The current work resolves the question of polynomial learnability for Gaussian mixtures in high dimension with an arbitrary fixed number of components. Specifically, we show that parameters of a Gaussian mixture distribution with fixed number of components can be learned using a sample whose size is polynomial in dimension and all other parameters. The result on learning Gaussian mixtures relies on an analysis of distributions belonging to what we call "polynomial families" in low dimension. These families are characterized by their moments being polynomial in parameters and include almost all common probability distributions as well as their mixtures and products. Using tools from real algebraic geometry, we show that parameters of any distribution belonging to such a family can be learned in polynomial time and using a polynomial number of sample points. The result on learning polynomial families is quite general and is of independent interest. To estimate parameters of a Gaussian mixture distribution in high dimensions, we provide a deterministic algorithm for dimensionality reduction. This allows us to reduce learning a high-dimensional mixture to a polynomial number of parameter estimations in low dimension. Combining this reduction with the results on polynomial families yields our result on learning arbitrary Gaussian mixtures in high dimensions.

Our algorithms can be extended to some kernelized versions of these problems, such as SVDD, hard margin SVM, and L(2)-SVM, for which sublinear-time algorithms were not known before. These new algorithms use a combination of a novel sampling techniques and a new multiplicative update algorithm. We give lower bounds which show the running times of many of our algorithms to be nearly best possible in the unit-cost RAM model. We also give implementations of our algorithms in the semi-streaming setting, obtaining the first low pass polylogarithmic space and sublinear time algorithms achieving arbitrary approximation factor.

In this paper we present machine-learning based algorithms by which a cell phone can discern that it may be lost, and take steps to enhance its chances of being successfully recovered. We use data collected from the Reality Mining project [10] to create a suite of realistic test cases that model lost cell phone behavior. On these data sets our best algorithms can identify cases of a lost mobile device, based on its behavior over the previous 3 hours, with close to 100% accuracy. In addition, the algorithm generates false positive identifications with probability less than 3%; for individuals with relatively predictable lifestyles the False Positive Rate is substantially less. We also use the Reality Mining data to construct a set of test cases that model the behavior of a stolen phone, and show that similar algorithmic techniques give reasonable results in this setting as well.

There are several variants of the matching problem, concerned with isometries, isomorphisms, homeomorphisms, and node attributes; different approaches exist for each variant. We show how structured estimation methods from machine learning can be used to combine such variants into a single version of graph matching. In this paradigm, the extent to which our datasets reveal isometries, isomorphisms, homeomorphisms, and other properties is automatically accounted for in the learning process so that any such specific qualification of graph matching loses meaning. We present experiments with real computer vision data showing the leverage of this unified formulation.

Some systems focus on involved learning algorithms, some leverage millions of training images, and some systems focus on modeling relevant information (features) with the goal of effective recognition. However, none of these systems come close to human capabilities. If we study human responses on similar problems we could gain insight into which of the three factors (1) learning algorithm (2) amount of training data and (3) features is critical to humans' superior performance. In this work we take a small step towards this goal by performing a series of human studies and machine experiments. We find no evidence that human pattern matching algorithms are better than standard machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we find that humans don't leverage increased amounts of training data. Through statistical analysis on the machine experiments and supporting human studies, we find that the main factor impacting accuracies is the choice of features.

In the standard approach, a boundary detector is trained by minimizing its pixel-level disagreement with human boundary tracings. This naive metric is problematic because it is overly sensitive to boundary locations. This problem is solved by metrics provided with the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, but these can be insensitive to topological differences, such as gaps in boundaries. Furthermore, the Berkeley metrics have not been useful as cost functions for supervised learning. Using concepts from digital topology, we propose a new metric called the warping error that tolerates disagreements over boundary location, penalizes topological disagreements, and can be used directly as a cost function for learning boundary detection, in a method that we call Boundary Learning by Optimization with Topological Constraints (BLOTC). We trained boundary detectors on electron microscopic images of neurons, using both BLOTC and standard training. BLOTC produced substantially better performance on a 1.2 million pixel test set, as measured by both the warping error and the Rand index evaluated on segmentations generated from the boundary labelings. We also find our approach yields significantly better segmentation performance than either gPb-OWT-UCM or multiscale normalized cut, as well as Boosted Edge Learning trained directly on our data.

Facial trait judgments have been studied in the psychological field, and have been determined to influence important social outcomes of our lives, such as elections outcomes and social relationships. Recent work on textual descriptions of faces has shown that trait judgments are highly correlated. Further, behavioral studies suggest that two orthogonal dimensions, valence and dominance, can describe the basis of the human judgments from faces. In this paper, we used a corpus of behavioral data of judgments on different trait dimensions to automatically learn a trait predictor from facial pixel images. We study whether trait evaluations performed by humans can be learned using machine learning classifiers, and used later in automatic evaluations of new facial images. The experiments performed using local point-based descriptors show promising results in the evaluation of the main traits.

Traditional methods based on machine learning or computer vision are still in the stage of tackling hundreds of object categories. In recent years, non-parametric approaches have demonstrated great success, which understand the content of an image by propagating labels of its similar images in a large-scale dataset. However, due to the limited dataset size and imperfect image crawling strategy, previous work can only address a biased small subset of image concepts. Here we introduce the Arista project, which aims to build a practical image annotation engine targeting at popular concepts in the real world. In this project, we are particularly interested in understanding how many image concepts can be addressed by the data-driven annotation approach (coverage) and how good the performance is (precision). This paper reports the first stage of the work. Two billions web images were indexed, and based on simple yet effective near-duplicate detection, the system is capable of automatically generating accurate tags for popular web images having near-duplicates in the database. We found that about 8.1% web images have more than ten near duplicate and the number increases to 28.5% for top images in search results. Further, based on random samples in the latter case, we observed the precision of 57.9% at the point of the highest recall of 28% on ground truth tags.

Exploiting prior knowledge may be useful to reproduce the human capability of recognizing objects even from only one single view. This paper presents an SVM-based model adaptation algorithm able to select and weight appropriately prior knowledge coming from different categories. The method relies on the solution of a convex optimization problem which ensures to have the minimal leave-one-out error on the training set. Experiments on a subset of the Caltech-256 database show that the proposed method produces better results than both choosing one single prior model, and transferring from all previous experience in a flat uninformative way.

While many challenging online learning problems are inherently multi-class, online boosting and its variants are only able to solve binary tasks. In this paper, we present Online Multi-Class LPBoost (OMCLP) which is directly applicable to multi-class problems. From a theoretical point of view, our algorithm tries to maximize the multi-class soft-margin of the samples. In order to solve the LP problem in online settings, we perform an efficient variant of online convex programming, which is based on primal-dual gradient descent-ascent update strategies. We conduct an extensive set of experiments over machine learning benchmark datasets, as well as, on Caltech101 category recognition dataset. We show that our method is able to outperform other online multi-class methods. We also apply our method to tracking where, we present an intuitive way to convert the binary tracking by detection problem to a multi-class problem where background patterns which are similar to the target class, become virtual classes. Applying our novel model, we outperform or achieve the state-of-the-art results on benchmark tracking videos.

Currently, opportunistic or dynamic spectrum access and transmission power control are popular coexistence optimization strategies among the CR research community. We propose a coexistence optimized cognitive engine (COCE), which combines machine learning with expert knowledge. COCE classifies coexisting radio systems using a fuzzy logic based signal classifier and in turn chooses suitable transmission parameters for the underlying radio platform from its knowledge base. Initially, we implement COCE as a TPC engine, which chooses the optimal transmission power for the underlying radio platform to ensure a desired quality-of-service. We implemented a testbed to demonstrate the performance of COCE using conventional microcontroller (mu C) as well as super heterodyne transceivers and present the results in this contribution.

In our project a new IS system (LAGUNTXO) which adds user affective information oriented to people with intellectual disabilities has been developed. The system integrates a Human Emotion Analysis System (HEAS) which attempts to solve critical situations for this community as block stages. In the development of the HEAS one of the critical issues was to create appropriated databases to train the system due to the difficulty to simulate pre-block stages in laboratory specifically in the case of people with disabilities. A film and real sequences based emotion elicitation database was created. The elicitation material was categorized with features based on discrete emotions and dimensional terms (pleasant, unpleasant).

In this paper, we investigate the effects of alternative feature space partitioning techniques in a multiple population island-based parallel XCS. Here, each of the isolated populations evolve rules based on a subset of the features. The behavior of the multiple population model is carefully analyzed and compared with the original XCS using the Boolean logic multiplexer problem as a test case. Simulation results show that our multiple population XCS produced better performance and better generalization than the single population XCS model, especially when the problem increased in size. A caveat, however, is that the effectiveness of the model was dependent upon the feature space partitioning strategy used.

Evolving Spatial and Frequency Selection Filters for Brain-Computer Interfaces	2010 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET				Machine Learning techniques are routinely applied to Brain Computer Interfaces in order to learn a classifier for a particular user. However, research has shown that classification techniques perform better if the EEG signal is previously preprocessed to provide high quality attributes to the classifier. Spatial and frequency-selection filters can be applied for this purpose. In this paper, we propose to automatically optimize these filters by means of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The technique has been tested on data from the BCI-III competition, because both raw and manually filtered datasets were supplied, allowing to compare them. Results show that the CMA-ES is able to obtain higher accuracies than the datasets preprocessed by manually tuned filters.

The algorithm can use any cluster validity function as fitness function. Cluster validity is used as a criterion for cross-over operations. The cluster assignment for each point is accompanied by a temperature and points with low confidence are preferentially mutated. We present results applying this genetic algorithm to several UCI machine learning data sets and using several objective cluster validity functions for optimization. It is shown that given an appropriate criterion function, the algorithm is able to converge on good cluster partitions within few generations. Our main contributions are: 1. to present a genetic algorithm that is fast and able to converge on meaningful clusters for real-world data sets, 2. to define and compare several cluster validity criteria.

In fact, in several applications good results over training data are not as important as good results over unseen data. While this problem was deeply studied in other machine learning techniques, it has become an important issue for genetic programming only in the last few years. In this paper we compare the generalization ability of several different genetic programming frameworks, including some variants of multi-objective genetic programming and operator equalization, a recently defined bloat free genetic programming system. The test problem used is a hard regression real-life application in the field of drug discovery and development, characterized by a high number of features and where the generalization ability of the proposed solutions is a crucial issue. The results we obtained show that, at least for the considered problem, multi-optimization is effective in improving genetic programming generalization ability, outperforming all the other methods on test data.

Most existing approaches do not particularly deal with data instances matched by more than one rule, which results in restricted performance. We present a two-phase multiobjective evolutionary algorithm which first aims at searching decent rules and then takes the rule interaction into account to produce the final rule sets. The algorithm incorporates the concept of Pareto dominance to deal with trade-off relations in both phases. Through computational experiments, the proposed algorithm shows competitive to the state-of-the-art. We also study the effect of a niching mechanism.

In this contribution, we present an evolutionary algorithm based approach for multi-objective optimization of the sensitivity and specificity of a v-SVM. The v-SVM is often preferred over the standard C-SVM due to smaller dynamic range of the v parameter compared to the unlimited dynamic range of the C parameter. Instead of looking for a single optimization result, we look for a set of optimal solutions that lie along the Pareto optimality front. The traditional advantage of using the Pareto optimality is of course the flexibility to choose any of the solutions that lies on the Pareto optimality front. However, we show that simply maximizing sensitivity and specificity over the Pareto front leads to parameters that appear to be mathematically optimal yet still cause overfitting. We propose a multiple objective optimization approach with three objective functions to find additional parameter values that do not cause overfitting.

This scenario, typical for co-evolving artificial-life agents, learning strategies for games, and machine learning from examples, can be formalized as test-based problem. In test-based problems, candidate solutions are evaluated on a number of test cases (agents, opponents, examples). It has been recently shown that at least some of such problems posses underlying problem structure, which can be formalized in a notion of coordinate system, which spatially arranges candidate solutions and tests in a multidimensional space. Such a coordinate system can be extracted to reveal underlying objectives of the problem, which can be then further exploited to help coevolutionary algorithm make progress. In this study, we propose a novel coevolutionary archive method, called Coordinate System Archive (COSA) that is based on these concepts. In the experimental part, we compare COSA to two state-of-the-art archive methods, IPCA and LAPCA. Using two different objective performance measures, we find out that COSA is superior to these methods on a class of artificial problems (COMPARE-ON-ONE).

Their effectiveness depends on two critical design decisions: 1) mapping a decision problem into an n-dimensional feature space, and 2) choosing a kernel function that maps the n-dimensional feature space into a higher dimensional and more effective classification space. The choice of kernel functions is generally limited to a small set of well-studied candidates. However, the choice of a feature set is much more open-ended without much design guidance. In fact, many SVMs are designed with standard generic feature space mappings embedded a priori. In this paper we describe a procedure for using an evolutionary algorithm to design more compact non-standard feature mappings that, for a fixed kernel function, significantly improves the classification accuracy of the constructed SVM.

While elucidating complex miRNA-mRNA interactions has been studied with experimental and computational approaches, it is still difficult to infer miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules. Here we present a novel method for identifying functional miRNA-mRNA modules from heterogeneous expression data. The proposed approach is layered hypernetworks consisting of two layers which are the layer of modality-dependent hypernetworks and of an integrating hypernetwork. The layered hypernetwork model is suitable for detecting relationships between heterogeneous modalities. Applied to the analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles on multiple human cancers, the proposed model identifies oncogenic miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules. The experimental results show that our method provides a competitive performance to support vector machines, and outperforms other standard machine learning algorithms. The biological significance of the discovered miRNA-mRNA modules were validated by literature reviews.

Here, disciplines could either be different functions, which we want to optimize, or specific performance measures of the optimization procedure. We would then be interested in the algorithm that performs best in a majority of cases or whose average performance is maximal. We will focus on evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOA), and will present a novel approach to the design and analysis of evolutionary multiobjective benchmark experiments based on similar work from the context of machine learning. We focus on deriving a consensus among several benchmarks over different test problems and illustrate the methodology by reanalyzing the results of the CEC 2007 EMOA competition.

This paper details the application of neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) and accuracy-based learning classifier system (XCS) to the Robocode game environment, with the aim of discovering the ability of each algorithm to learn in this environment. Existing implementations of each algorithm were modified and augmented to allow them to operate in Robocode. In the experiments, performance is measured by pitting the algorithmically-driven players against a series of opponents in various tactical challenges. We conclude by discussing the comparative advantages and disadvantages of both NEAT and XCS as applied to Robocode. Both are able to learn competent strategies, but NEAT is susceptible to overfitting and XCS struggles when many actions are available. The selection of appropriate training scenarios is shown to be a key factor in ensuring that evolved strategies are maximally general for both algorithms.

The main advantage of using evolutionary algorithms in those application areas is their flexibility: Various knowledge extraction criteria such as accuracy and complexity can be easily utilized as fitness functions. On the other hand, the main disadvantage is their large computation load. It is not easy to apply evolutionary algorithms to large data sets. The scalability improvement to large data sets is one of the main research issues in GBML. In our former studies, we proposed an idea of parallel distributed implementation of GBML and examined its effectiveness for genetic fuzzy rule selection. The point of our idea was to realize a quadratic speed-up by dividing not only a population but also training data. Training data subsets were periodically rotated over sub-populations in order to prevent each sub-population from over-fitting to a specific training data subset. In this paper, we propose the use of parallel distributed implementation for the design of ensemble classifiers. An ensemble classifier is designed by combining base classifiers, each of which is obtained from each sub-population. Through computational experiments on parallel distributed genetic fuzzy rule selection, we examine the generalization ability of designed ensemble classifiers under various settings with respect to the size of training data subsets and their rotation frequency.

Despite the abundance of AI algorithms and machine learning techniques, the state of the art still fails to capture the rich analytical properties of biological beings or their robustness. Most parallel hardware architectures tend to combine Von Neumann style processors to make a multi-processor environment and computation is based on Arithmetic and Logic Units (ALU). This paper introduces an alternate architecture that is inspired from the biological world, and is fundamentally different from traditional processing which uses arithmetic operations. The architecture proposed here is targeted towards robust artificial intelligence applications.

When a machine learning method is applied to the reduced dataset, the accuracy of the model should not be significantly worse than if the same method were applied to the entire dataset. The reducibility of any dataset, and hence the success of instance selection methods, surely depends on the characteristics of the dataset, as well as the machine learning method. This paper adopts a meta-learning approach, via an empirical study of 112 classification datasets from the UCI Repository [1], to explore the relationship between data characteristics, machine learning methods, and the success of instance selection method.

Different from typical approaches, not only the signal strength, but also the number and the radio power profiles of the primary transmitters are estimated, which greatly facilitates resource management in cognitive radio. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can still roughly reconstruct the power propagation map of the primary transmitters even when the measurement rate is below the lower bound for which compressive sensing (CS) can reconstruct signals with the l(1)-norm optimization method. Compared with the typical CS and Bayesian CS algorithms, simulation results show that average mean squared errors (MSE) of the estimated power propagation map are lower with the proposed algorithm. Besides, the computational complexity is also lower owing to bases pruning. The MSE of the location estimation are also shown to demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm.

Cognitive Multipath Multi-Channel Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks	2010 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE GLOBECOM 2010	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010)	DEC 06-10, 2010	Miami, FL	IEEE		multipath; multi-channel; cognitive; machine learning; mobile ad-hoc network; prediction		This paper introduces a novel cognitive multipath multi-channel routing protocol (CMMRP) for mobile ad-hoc networks. It is designed for a multi-channel environment where nodes can simultaneously use multiple interfaces to transmit packets over different frequencies. It employs cognitive functions to make nodes intelligently select multiple node-disjoint, edge-disjoint and frequency-disjoint paths. Neural network machine learning is adopted to make nodes aware of history. CMMRP employs a modified path discovery protocol which can be divided into two parts, a space discovery and spectrum discovery. Simulation results show that CMMRP significantly improves network reliability and performance.

It is an on-demand cognitive routing protocol. It employs an intelligent flooding protocol, a novel approach for scalable flooding. A neural network machine learning method is adopted to make nodes aware of history. The intelligent flooding protocol saves routing overhead because nodes selectively flood RREQ packets along predicted strong links and over predicted good frequencies. The intelligent flooding protocol can be divided into two parts, the space flooding protocol and the spectrum flooding protocol. Simulation results show that SCRP scales well by network size, network dynamics and network spectrum.

We employ Multi-layer Feedforward Neural Network (MFNN) models that utilize historical traffic information from network environment for learning the influence of spatio-temporal-spectral factors on the network and then predicting future traffic loads on each of the channels. Based on the future traffic loads, CogAP chooses the best channel for serving wireless clients. An important factor is the time scale of traffic prediction. We construct three kinds of traffic predictors that predict traffic at different time scales: MLP (Minute Level Prediction), MILP (Minute Interval Level Prediction), and HLP (Hourly Level Prediction) schemes and study their prediction accuracy. Experiment results show that MFNN predictors perform better than traditional autoregressive models in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition to accurate prediction, another factor that influences the design of cognitive network channel selection is the impact of channel selection strategy on the transport layer performance. We, therefore, conduct performance studies on the TCP throughput achieved on the above mentioned cognitive channel selection strategies. The MFNN predictors will also help CogAP to find and switch to the optimal channel, leading to a higher and more sustained throughput.	[Liu, Yao; Tamma, Bheemarjuna Reddy; Manoj, B.

While traditional payload-based methods are powerless to deal with encrypted traffic, machine learning methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, these methods often bring heavy overhead into the system. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method that combines signature-based methods and statistical analysis methods to address this issue. We first identify SSL/TLS traffic with signature matching methods, and then apply statistical analysis to determine concrete application protocols. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is able to recognize over 99% of SSL/TLS traffic and achieve 94.52% in F-score for protocols identification.

However, past applications are limited to rather simple configurations such as identifying channel condition or link adaptation in fixed or slowly varying channels. Recently, more sophisticated approaches using offline supervised learning have been proposed for link adaptation in complex configurations such as MIMO-OFDM. However, their time complexity and offline training phase hamper their real-world applicability. Approaches using online learning have shown good throughput performance, but the high memory requirement makes them inefficient or even impractical. In this paper, we propose a new effective online learning algorithm for link adaptation. Our computations show that the algorithm performs comparably to the existing online learning approaches, but ours requires minimal storage and time, which makes it more practical. Moreover it adapts to the change of channel distribution quickly.

Due to the truly ubiquitous nature of these devices, the data is created potentially at all times of the day and in different wireless environments, e. g., at home, on the subway, at a coffeeshop. These data must eventually be uploaded to the server cloud from the mobile device by connecting to a wireless network. In different environments, the available wireless networks change, and the cost of connecting to them in order to upload these data also changes. For different applications, the preference for the uploading time for their data may be very different. We study the problem of optimizing the time for uploading based on the preferenc measure as well as the cost of the wireless network available at the time of uploading. Furthermore, because the wireless environment is dynamic and nondeterministic in the future, we use machine learning techniques for modeling user mobility patterns and predicting the wireless network in the near future, to assist in finding the optimal uploading time.

In this work we study the widely used 802.11 protocol and present a solution to detect selfish carrier-sensing behavior where a node raises the CCA (clear channel assessment) threshold for carrier-sensing, or simply does not sense carrier (possibly randomly to avoid detection). Our approach is based on detecting any asymmetry in carrier-sense behavior between node pairs and finding multiple such witnesses to raise confidence. The approach is completely passive. It requires deploying multiple sniffers across the network to capture wireless traffic traces. These traces are then analyzed by using a machine learning approach to infer carrier-sense relationships between network nodes. Evaluations using a real testbed as well as ns2 simulation studies demonstrate excellent detection ability. The metric of selfishness used to estimate selfish behavior matches closely with actual degree of selfishness observed.

Many researchers have explored this domain, with mixed results, but few have examined the relatively impoverished territory of digits only, particularly when restricted to using a single finger - which might come into play on an automated teller machine, a mobile phone, a digital telephone dial, or a digital electronic security keypad at a building entrance. In this work, 28 users typed the same 10-digit number, using only the right-hand index finger. Employing statistical machine-learning techniques (random forest), we achieved an unweighted correct-detection rate of 99.97% with a corresponding false-alarm rate of 1.51%, using practiced 2-of-3 encore typing with outlier handling. This level of accuracy approaches sufficiency for two-factor authentication for passwords or PIN numbers.

According to the literature, software faults are becoming one of the main sources of unplanned system outages, and have an important impact on company benefits and image. For this reason, a lot of techniques (such as clustering, fail-over techniques, or server redundancy) have been proposed to avoid software failures, and yet they still happen. Many software failures are those due to the software aging phenomena. In this work, we present a detailed evaluation of our chosen machine learning prediction algorithm (M5P) in front of dynamic and non-deterministic software aging. We have tested our prediction model on a three-tier web 12EE application achieving acceptable prediction accuracy against complex scenarios with small training data sets. Furthermore, we have found an interesting approach to help to determine the root cause failure: The model generated by machine learning algorithms.

The classical Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) needs a number of atoms to accurately decompose the spectrogram of such sounds. An extension of NMF is proposed hereafter which includes time-frequency activations based on ARMA modeling. This leads to an efficient single-atom decomposition for a single audio event. The new algorithm is tested on real audio data and shows promising results.

In this paper, we introduce a technique to guarantee that our data obeys certain isometric properties. In addition, we introduce a bayesian approach to compressive sensing, which we call ABCS, allowing us to obtain complete statistics for estimated parameters. We apply these ideas to fMRI classification and find that by isometrically transforming our data, significant improvements in classification accuracy can be achieved using the LASSO and Dantzig selector methods, two standard techniques used in CS. In addition, applying the ABCS method offers improvements in classification accuracy over both LASSO and Dantzig. Finally, we find that applying both the ABCS method together with isometric transformations, we are able to achieve an error rate of 0.0%.

At each pixel location, only one of the three color values is known. The interpolation of the two missing color values at each pixel in a color filter array image (CFA) is called demosaicing. In this paper, we propose a novel training-based approach for computing the missing green pixels in a CFA. The algorithm works by extracting a multi-dimensional feature vector comprising derivatives of various orders computed in a spatial neighborhood of the pixel being interpolated. Using a statistical machine learning framework, the feature vector is then used to predict the optimal interpolation direction for estimating the missing green pixel. The parameters of the statistical model are learned in an of offline training procedure using example training images. Once the green channel has been estimated, the red and blue pixels are estimated using bilinear interpolation of the difference (chrominance) channels. Both subjective and objective evaluations show that the proposed demosaic algorithm yields a high output image quality. The algorithm is computationally and memory efficient, and its sequential architecture makes it easy to implement in an imaging system.

In order to deal with the growing support inherent to online kernel methods, the proposed method uses a combined strategy of growing and pruning the support. In contrast to a previous sliding-window based technique, the presented algorithm does not prune the oldest data point in every time instant but it instead aims to prune the least significant data point. We also introduce a label update procedure to equip the algorithm with tracking capability. Simulations show that the proposed method obtains better performance than state-of-the-art kernel adaptive filtering techniques given similar memory requirements.

However, the main disadvantage is lack of sparseness of solutions. In this article Compressive Sampling (CS), which addresses the sparse signal representation, is employed to find the support vectors of LS-SVM. The main difference between our work and the existing techniques is that the proposed method can locate the sparse topology while training. In contrast, most of the traditional methods need to train the model before finding the sparse support vectors. An experimental comparison with the standard LS-SVM and existing algorithms is given for function approximation and classification problems. The results show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with typically a much sparser model.

It also encompasses existing integration methods as its special case, e. g., weighted average and exponential mixture. In alpha-integration, the value of a determines the characteristics of the integration and the weight vector w assigns the degree of importance to each measure. In most of the existing work, however, a and w are given in advance rather than learned. In this paper we present two algorithms, for learning a and w from data when only a few integrated target values are available. Numerical experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data confirm the proposed method's effectiveness.

In our previous work, we discussed a class of kernels whose corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have an invariant metric and proved that the kernel corresponding to the smallest reproducing kernel Hilbert space, including an unknown true function, gives the optimal model.

IMAGE-QUALITY PREDICTION OF SYNTHETIC APERTURE SONAR IMAGERY	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	MAR 10-19, 2010	Dallas, TX	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Image-Quality Prediction; Gaussian Process Regression; Spectral Clustering; Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models; Large Data Sets		This work exploits several machine-learning techniques to address the problem of image-quality prediction of synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery. The objective is to predict the correlation of sonar ping-returns as a function of range from the sonar by using measurements of sonar-platform motion and estimates of environmental characteristics. The environmental characteristics are estimated by effectively performing unsupervised seabed segmentation, which entails extracting wavelet-based features, performing spectral clustering, and learning a variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model. The motion measurements and environmental features are then used to learn a Gaussian process regression model so that ping correlations can be predicted. To handle issues related to the large size of the data set considered, sparse methods and an out-of-sample extension for spectral clustering are also exploited. The approach is demonstrated on an enormous data set of real SAS images collected in the Baltic Sea.

Our scheme is based on our recently introduced machine learning algorithm called Simultaneous Temporal And Contextual Splitting (STACS) that discovers the appropriate number of states and efficiently learns accurate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) parameters for the given data. STACS-based algorithms train HMMs up to five times faster than Baum-Welch, avoid the overfitting problem commonly encountered in learning large state-space HMMs using Expectation Maximization (EM) methods such as Baum-Welch, and achieve superior classification results on a very diverse dataset with minimal pre-processing. Furthermore, our scheme has proven to be highly effective for building real-world applications and has been integrated into a commercial surveillance system as an event detection component.

State-of-the-art systems for AVR are based on traditional machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), however, such classifiers can not deal with efficiency and effectiveness at the same time, existing a gap to be explored when real-time processing is required. In this work, we present an algorithm for AVR based on the Optimum-Path Forest (OPF), which is an emergent pattern recognition technique recently introduced in literature. Adopting a supervised training procedure and using speech tags from two public datasets, we observed that OPF has outperformed ANNs, SVMs, plus other classifiers, in terms of training time and accuracy.

The standard sparse models are not invariant to spatial transformations such as image rotations, and the representation is very sensitive even under small such distortions. Most studies addressing this problem proposed algorithms which either use transformed data as part of the training set, or are invariant or robust only under minor transformations. In this paper we suggest a framework which extracts sparse features invariant under significant rotations and scalings. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical architecture of dictionary learning for sparse coding in a cortical (log-polar) space. The proposed model is tested in supervised classification applications and proved to be robust under transformed data.

A popular heuristic minimizes the nuclear norm (sum of the singular values) of the matrix instead of the rank, and was recently shown to give an exact solution in several scenarios. In this paper, we present a new analysis for this heuristic based on a property of the nullspace of the operator defining the constraints, called the spherical section property. We give conditions for the exact recovery of all matrices up to a certain rank, and show that these conditions hold with high probability for operators generated from random Gaussian ensembles. Our analysis provides simpler proofs than existing isometry-based methods, as well as robust recovery results when the matrix is not exactly low-rank.

However, a limitation was that the experiments were performed using only a clean speech recognition task with a ML trained initial acoustic model. Another limitation was that only the CV method was investigated while there was a possibility of using other ensemble methods. In this study, we evaluate the CV method using a discriminatively trained baseline and a noisy speech recognition task. As an alternative to CV adaptation, unsupervised aggregated (Ag) adaptation is proposed and investigated that introduces a bagging like idea instead of CV. Experimental results show that CV and Ag adaptations consistently give larger improvements than the conventional batch adaptation but the former is more advantageous in terms of computational cost.

This paper focuses on automatic sentence segmentation of speech in two different languages - English and Czech. For this task, we compare and combine three statistical models - HMM, maximum entropy, and a boosting-based model BoosTexter. All these approaches rely on both textual and prosodic information. We evaluate these methods on a corpus of multiparty meetings in English, and on a corpus of broadcast conversations in Czech, using both manual and speech recognition transcripts. The experiments show that superior results are achieved when all the three models are combined via posterior probability interpolation. We observe differences in terms of model performance between English and Czech, as well as the feature usage difference in prosodic models between the two languages. Overall, the analysis is important for porting sentence segmentation approaches from one language to another.

However, the imbalanced-data problem sometimes results in a trained speech summarizer with unsatisfactory performance. On the other hand, training the summarizer by improving the associated classification accuracy does not always lead to better summarization evaluation performance. In view of such phenomena, we hence investigate two different training criteria to alleviate the negative effects caused by them, as well as to boost the summarizer's performance. One is to learn the classification capability of a summarizer on the basis of the pair-wise ordering information of sentences in a training document according to a degree of importance. The other is to train the summarizer by directly maximizing the associated evaluation score. Experimental results on the broadcast news summarization task show that these two training criteria can give substantial improvements over the baseline SVM summarization system.

Hierarchical Fuzzy System Modeling by Genetic and Bacterial Programming Approaches	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET				In this paper a method is proposed for constructing hierarchical fuzzy rule bases in order to model black box systems defined by input-output pairs, i.e. to solve supervised machine learning problems. The resultant hierarchical rule base is the knowledge base, which is constructed by using structure constructing evolutionary techniques, namely, Genetic and Bacterial Programming Algorithms. Applying hierarchical fuzzy rule bases is a way of reducing the complexity of the knowledge base, whereas evolutionary methods ensure a relatively efficient learning process. This is the reason of the investigation of this combination.

The approach is based on the formulation of fuzzy-rough discernibility matrices, that can be transformed into a satisfiability problem; an extension of rough set approaches that only apply to discrete datasets. The fuzzy-rough hybrid reduction method is then realised algorithmically by a modified version of a traditional satisifability approach. This produces an efficient and provably optimal approach to data reduction that works well on a number of machine learning benchmarks in terms of both time and classification accuracy.

In this work we present an automatic extraction method to determine the domains of competence of Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems As a case of study we use the Fuzzy Hybrid Genetic Based Machine Learning method. We consider twelve metrics of data complexity in order to analyze the behavior patterns of this method, obtaining intervals of such data complexity measures with good or bad performance of it. Combining these intervals we obtain rules that describe both good or bad behaviors of the Fuzzy Rule Based Classification System mentioned. These rules allow describe both good or bad behaviors of the Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems mentioned, allowing us to characterize the response quality of the methods from the data set complexity metrics of a given data set. Thus, we can establish the domains of competence of the Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems considered, making it possible to establish when the method will perform well or badly prior to its application.

A New Approach for Semi-Supervised Clustering Based on Fuzzy C-Means	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET				In traditional machine learning applications, only labeled data is used to train the classifier. Labeled data are difficult, expensive, time-consuming and require human experts to be obtained in several real applications. Semi-supervised learning address this issue. Semi-supervised learning uses large amount of unlabeled data, combined with the labeled data, to build better classifiers. The semi-supervised algorithm could be an extension of an unsupervised algorithm. Such algorithm would be based on unsupervised clustering algorithms, adding a term in its objective function that makes use of labeled information to guide the learning process. This study presents a new algorithm for semi-supervised clustering based on Fuzzy C-Means algorithm. The classifier was evaluated and compared against two semi-supervised clustering algorithms in the context of learning from partially labeled data. The behavior of the proposed algorithm is discussed and the results are validated using cross-validation and the confidence interval. Thus, it was possible to certify the better accuracy performance of the new algorithm when a few labeled data are available.	[Macario, Valmir; de Carvalho, Francisco de A.

An evolutionary architecture was proposed to generate the rule base and to optimize the membership functions of a type-2 Fuzzy Classification System. The proposed architecture is composed of three stages. In the first stage of the architecture, a Genetic Algorithm generates the rule base of the Fuzzy Classification System using predefined and fixed membership functions. In the second stage, another Genetic Algorithm optimizes the interval type-2 membership functions that were used in the first stage. Finally, a third Genetic Algorithm is used for the optimization of the number of rules in the best Fuzzy Classification System generated in the two previous stages. Some experiments have been run using different datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in order to validate the proposed approach and to compare the results with the ones obtained with the Wang&Mendel method and a type-1 fuzzy classification system also generated by the evolutionary architecture proposed here. The results demonstrated that the type-2 fuzzy classification system performed better than the other classifiers used in the study.	[Pimenta, Adinovam H.

Feature Selection in Haptic-based Handwritten Signatures Using Rough Sets	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET				This paper explores the use of rough set theory for feature selection in high dimensional haptic-based handwritten signatures (exploited for user identification). Two rough set-based methods for feature selection are analyzed, the first is a greedy approach while the second relies on genetic algorithms to find minimal subsets of attributes. Also, to further reduce the haptic feature space while maximizing user identification accuracy, a method is proposed where feature vectors are subsampled prior to the feature selection procedure. Rough set-generated minimal subsets are initially exploited to determine the importance of different haptic data types (e. g. force, position, torque and orientation) in discriminating between different users. In addition, a comparison between rough set-based methods and classical machine learning techniques in the selection of minimal information-preserving subsets of features in high dimensional haptic datasets, is provided. The criteria for comparison are the length of the selected subsets of features and their corresponding discrimination power. Support Vector Machine classifiers are used to evaluate the accuracy of the selected minimal feature vectors. The results demonstrated that the combination of rough set and genetic algorithm techniques can outperform well-established machine learning methods in the selection of minimal subsets of features present in haptic-based handwritten signatures.

S	Senge, R; Hullermeier, E			IEEE	Senge, Robin; Huellermeier, Eyke			Pattern Trees for Regression and Fuzzy Systems Modeling	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET				Fuzzy pattern tree induction has recently been introduced as a novel classification method in the context of machine learning. Roughly speaking, a pattern tree is a hierarchical, tree-like structure, whose inner nodes are marked with generalized (fuzzy) logical operators and whose leaf nodes are associated with fuzzy predicates on input attributes. In this paper, we adapt the method of pattern tree induction so as to make it applicable to another learning task, namely regression. Thus, instead of predicting one among a finite number of discrete class labels, we address the problem of predicting a real-valued target output. Apart from showing that fuzzy pattern trees are able to approximate real-valued functions in an accurate manner, we argue that such trees are also interesting from a modeling point of view. In fact, by describing a functional relationship between several input attributes and an output variable in an interpretable way, pattern trees constitute a viable alternative to classical fuzzy rule models. Compared to flat rule models, the hierarchical structure of patterns trees further allows for a more compact representation and for trading off accuracy against model simplicity in a seamless manner.

Robustness of Neural Ensembles Against Targeted and Random Adversarial Learning	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET				Machine learning has become a prominent tool in various domains owing to its adaptability. However, this adaptability can be taken advantage of by an adversary to cause dysfunction of machine learning; a process known as Adversarial Learning. This paper investigates Adversarial Learning in the context of artificial neural networks. The aim is to test the hypothesis that an ensemble of neural networks trained on the same data manipulated by an adversary would be more robust than a single network. We investigate two attack types: targeted and random. We use Mahalanobis distance and covariance matrices to selected targeted attacks. The experiments use both artificial and UCI datasets. The results demonstrate that an ensemble of neural networks trained on attacked data are more robust against the attack than a single network. While many papers have demonstrated that an ensemble of neural networks is more robust against noise than a single network, the significance of the current work lies in the fact that targeted attacks are not white noise.

Counter-intuitively, we will show for the class of signal-independent additive noise, noisy data do not destroy the manifold structure thanks to the blessing of dimensionality. Based on this observation, we propose to reconstruct the manifold for a collection of exemplars by alternating between image filtering and neighborhood search. The byproduct of such manifold reconstruction from noisy data is an exemplar-Based EM-like (EBEM) denoising algorithm with minimal number of control parameters. Despite its conceptual simplicity, EBEM can achieve comparable performance to other leading algorithms in the literature. Our results suggest the importance of understanding the physical origin of manifold constraint underlying natural images the symmetry in natural scenes.

The QRS complex is the most important and distinguishable component in the ECG because of its spiked nature and high amplitude. Automatic detection and delineation of the QRS complex in ECG is of extreme importance for computer aided diagnosis of cardiac disorder. Therefore, the accurate detection of this component is crucial to the performance of subsequent machine learning algorithms for cardiac disease classification. The aim of the present work is to detect the QRS wave from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Initially the baseline drift has been removed from the signal followed by the decomposition using continuous wavelet transform. Modulus maxima approach proposed by Mallat has been used to compute the Lipschitz exponent of the components. By using the property of R peak, having highest and prominent amplitude and Lipschitz exponents, we have applied the K means clustering technique to classify QRS complex. In order to evaluate the algorithm, the analysis has been done on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database.

In this paper, we analyze the performance of a new feature descriptor, Local Directional Pattern (LDP), for the representation of facial expressions. LDP features are obtained by computing the edge response values in all eight directions at each pixel position and then a code is generated according to the relative magnitude's strength. Thus each expression is represented as a distribution of LDP codes. Different machine learning techniques are compared using Cohn-Kanade facial expression database for classification. Extensive experiments explicate the superiority of the proposed LDP based descriptor over other existing well known descriptors.

This creates connected networks whose links provide valuable informations in order to enhance the performance of many tasks in information retrieval including ranking and annotation. We introduce in this paper a novel image retrieval framework based on a new class of kernels referred to as "network-dependent". The main contribution of our method includes (i) a variational framework which helps designing a kernel using both the intrinsic image features and the underlying contextual informations resulting from different (e. g. social) links and (ii) the proof of convergence of the kernel to a fixed-point, that is positive definite and thus associated with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).

The bottleneck in retrieving these often precious datasets is the onboard data storing capability and the communication bandwidth, which limit the amount of data that can be sent back to Earth. In this paper, we propose a method based on the analysis of brain electrical activity to identify the scientific interest of experts towards a given image in a large set of images. Such a method can be used to efficiently create an abundant training set (images and whether they are scientifically interesting) with a considerably faster image presentation rate that can go beyond expert consciousness, with less interrogation time for experts and relatively high performance.

For instance, in an urban context, the detection is very difficult due to large variations in terms of shape, size, color, orientation, and the image may be blurred or have irregular illumination, etc. In this paper, we describe a robust and accurate multiresolution approach to detect and classify text regions in such scenarios. Based on generation/validation paradigm, we first segment images to detect character regions with a multiresolution algorithm able to manage large character size variations. The segmented regions are then filtered out using shape-based classification, and neighboring characters are merged to generate text hypotheses. A validation step computes a region signature based on texture analysis to reject false positives. We evaluate our algorithm in two challenging databases, achieving very good results.

IMPROVED MACHINE LEARNING FOR IMAGE CATEGORY RECOGNITION BY LOCAL COLOR CONSTANCY	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing ICIP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	SEP 26-29, 2010	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Local Color Constancy; Category Recognition; Bag of Words		Color constancy is the ability to recognize colors of objects invariant to the color of the light source. Systems for object detection or recognition in images use machine learning based on image descriptors to distinguish object and scene categories. However, there can be large variations in viewing and lighting conditions for real-world scenes, complicating the characteristics of images and consequently the image category recognition task. To reduce the effect of such variations, either color constancy algorithms or illumination-invariant color descriptors could be used. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of straightforward color constancy methods in practice, with respect to their utilization in a standard object classification problem, and also investigate their effects using local versions of these algorithms. These methods are then compared with color invariant descriptors. In a novel contribution, we ascertain that a combination of local color constancy methods and color invariant descriptors improve the performance of object recognition by as much as more than 10 percent, a significant improvement.

Inverse lithography synthesizes an optimal mask by treating the design as an image synthesis inverse problem. To date, much effort is dedicated to solving it for some nominal process conditions. However, the small feature size also suggests that the effect of process variations is more pronounced. In this paper, we design a mask that is robust against focus variations within the inverse lithography framework. Each iteration involves more computation than a similar method designed for the nominal conditions, but we simplify the task by using stochastic gradient descent, which is a technique from machine learning. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm is effective in producing robust masks.

A foreground object in the first frame is segmented by training the CRF on user interaction, i.e., by using user scribbles corresponding to foreground and background respectively for CRF training. The data term of the energy function in this CRF framework is designed as a function of the score of texture-color classifier trained by AdaBoost. From the second frame, a weighted data term that encodes the shape of the object is added to this energy function. The boundary pixels of the current frame are predicted by the optical flow, and a smaller cost is given to a pixel closer to the boundary and vice versa. Also, a confidence of optical flow is defined, and a larger weight is given to the data term when the confident is high. As a result, the data term related with the shape becomes important when the motion estimation is reliable, and conversely the color-texture term becomes important otherwise. Experimental results show that the proposed data term keeps the boundary correctly in most cases and provides comparable result when compared to a state-of-the-art method.

ACTION DETECTION USING MULTIPLE SPATIAL-TEMPORAL INTEREST POINT FEATURES	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMEDIA AND EXPO (ICME 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	JUL 19-23, 2010	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE				This paper considers the problem of detecting actions from cluttered videos. Compared with the classical action recognition problem, this paper aims to estimate not only the scene category of a given video sequence, but also the spatial-temporal locations of the action instances. In recent years, many feature extraction schemes have been designed to describe various aspects of actions. However, due to the difficulty of action detection, e. g., the cluttered background and potential occlusions, a single type of features cannot solve the action detection problems perfectly in cluttered videos. In this paper, we attack the detection problem by combining multiple Spatial-Temporal Interest Point (STIP) features, which detect salient patches in the video domain, and describe these patches by feature of local regions. The difficulty of combining multiple STIP features for action detection is two folds: First, the number of salient patches detected by different STIP methods varies across different salient patches. How to combine such features is not considered by existing fusion methods [13] [5]. Second, the detection in the videos should be efficient, which excludes many slow machine learning algorithms. To handle these two difficulties, we propose a new approach which combines Gaussian Mixture-Model with Branch-and-Bound search to efficiently locate the action of interest. We build a new challenging dataset for our action detection task, and our algorithm obtains impressive results. On classical KTH dataset, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

The navigation task requires identifying safe, traversable paths that allow the robot to progress towards a goal while avoiding obstacles. Machine learning techniques are well adapted to this task, accomplishing near-to-far learning by training appearance-based models using near-field stereo readings in order to predict safe terrain and obstacles in the far field. However, these methods are subject to degraded performance when training data sets exhibit class imbalance, or skew, where data instances of one class outnumber those in another. In such scenarios, classifiers can be overwhelmed by the majority class, and will tend to ignore the minority class. In this paper, we show that typical outdoor terrain scenarios are associated with training data imbalance, and examine the impact of using undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and biased penalties techniques to correct for imbalance in stereo-derived training data. We conduct a statistically significant, repeated measures empirical evaluation and demonstrate improved far-field terrain prediction performance when using such methods for handling class imbalance versus taking no corrective action at all.

A number of factors, such as lack of useful 3D features, variety of elevator panel designs, variation in lighting conditions, and small size of elevator buttons, render this goal quite difficult. To address the task of detecting, localizing, and labeling the buttons, we use state-of-the-art vision algorithms along with machine learning techniques to take advantage of contextual features. To verify our approach, we collected a dataset of 150 pictures of elevator panels from more than 60 distinct elevators, and performed extensive offline testing. On this very diverse dataset, our algorithm succeeded in correctly localizing and labeling 86.2% of the buttons. Using a mobile robot platform, we then validate our algorithms in experiments where, using only its on-board sensors, the robot autonomously interprets the panel and presses the appropriate button in elevators never seen before by the robot. In a total of 14 trials performed on 3 different elevators, our robot succeeded in localizing the requested button in all 14 trials and in pressing it correctly in 13 of the 14 trials.

The controller regulates the length of the tendons to achieve a desired orientation of the neck and at the same time it maintains the tension of the tendons within certain limits. The solution we propose does not use any model of the system, but it relies on online learning of the different Jacobian mappings required by the controller. Learning, data acquisition and control are simultaneous; thus learning is completely autonomous, and purely online. We show that after enough iterations the controller produces straight trajectories in the task space and is able to maintain the tension of the tendons within safe limits.

The algorithm takes advantage of the passive dynamics of walking, assisting only when necessary with an intermittent oscillator driving the hip joint. We analyze inherent reasons of falling for a biped system based on dynamic principles and assume that human walking relies more on instinct actions within the spinal cord rather than brain. Corresponding falling tendency function is proposed, based on which a reflex controller adjusting output of oscillator is designed. An auxiliary span angle controller is put forward to provide secondary actuations for compensation to improve landing performance. The proposed reflex system requires no prior knowledge of the terrain or tens of hundreds of experiments, which are necessary for machine learning methods. Results of simulations indicate that our reflex controllers are capable of ensuring stable passive blind walking on slope varying terrains without ankle torque.

Applications of such a system includes quality assurance and estimating surface friction during manipulation tasks. A naive Bayes classifier is used to distinguish textures sensed by a bio-inspired artificial finger. The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensity of vibrations in the silicone. Textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger is pre-processed and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to learn a classifier for different textures. The performance of the classifier is evaluated against a naive time domain based learner. Preliminary results show that our classifier performs better.

Haptic feedback, expressed through joint motor currents and ground contact force measurements that arises when prescribing a predefined motion was collected for a variety of ground samples (four different shapes and four different surface properties). Features were extracted from this data and used for training and classification by a multiclass AdaBoost machine learning algorithm. In a single leg testbed, the algorithm could correctly classify about 94% of the terrain shapes, and about 73% of the surface samples.	[Hoepflinger, Mark A.; Remy, C.

However, their performance is subject to the availability and accuracy of digital road maps. Most current digital maps are still inadequate for advanced applications in unstructured environments. Lack of detailed up-to-date information and insufficient accuracy and refinement of the road geometry are among the most important shortcomings. The massive use of inexpensive GPS receivers, combined with the rapidly increasing availability of wireless communication infrastructure, suggests that large volumes of data combining both modalities will be available in a near future. The approach presented here draws on machine learning techniques to process logs of position traces to consistently build a detailed and accurate representation of the road network and, more importantly, extract the actual paths followed by vehicles. Experimental results with data from large mining operations are presented to validate the algorithm.

A recent successful approach applies machine learning to learn one grasp point in an image and a point cloud. Although those methods are able to generalize to novel objects, they yield suboptimal results because they rely on motion planner for finger placements. In this paper, we extend their method to accommodate grasps with multiple contacts. This approach works well for many human-made objects because it models the way we grasp objects. To further improve the grasping, we also use a method that learns the ranking between candidates. The experiments show that our method is highly effective compared to a state-of-the-art competitor.

One of the primary reasons why bug fixing takes so long is the difficulty of accurately assigning a bug to the most competent developer for that bug kind or bug class. Assigning a bug to a potential developer, also known as bug triaging, is a labor-intensive, time-consuming and fault-prone process if done manually. Moreover, bugs frequently get reassigned to multiple developers before they are resolved, a process known as bug tossing. Researchers have proposed automated techniques to facilitate bug triaging and reduce bug tossing using machine learning-based prediction and tossing graphs. While these techniques achieve good prediction accuracy for triaging and reduce tossing paths, they are vulnerable to several issues: outdated training sets, inactive developers, and imprecise, single-attribute tossing graphs. In this paper we improve triaging accuracy and reduce tossing path lengths by employing several techniques such as refined classification using additional attributes and intra-fold updates during training, a precise ranking function for recommending potential tossees in tossing graphs, and multi-feature tossing graphs. We validate our approach on two large software projects, Mozilla and Eclipse, covering 856,259 bug reports and 21 cumulative years of development. We demonstrate that our techniques can achieve up to 83.62% prediction accuracy in bug triaging. Moreover, we reduce tossing path lengths to 1.5-2 tosses for most bugs, which represents a reduction of up to 86.31% compared to original tossing paths. Our improvements have the potential to significantly reduce the bug fixing effort, especially in the context of sizable projects with large numbers of testers and developers.

So far, we have proposed an efficient algorithm for inducing NNTrees, and verified through experiments that NNTrees are efficient and effective for solving different pattern recognition problems. However, for problems like text categorization, induction of NNTrees can be very computationally expensive. To solve this problem, we have tried to induce NNTrees after dimensionality reduction. Specifically, we have studied the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based approach, the principal component analysis (PCA) based approach, and the direct centroid (DC) based approach. Results show that DC is simple but not effective; and LDA performs better but the computational cost for finding the transformation matrix is very high. To solve the problem more efficiently, we propose in this paper the discriminant multiple centroid (DMC) approach. Actually, DMC is a two-stage approach, in which all data are first mapped to a lower dimensional space based on the centroids, and the LDA is then conducted in the mapped space. Experimental results obtained for three public text datasets show that in all cases DMC is much faster than LDA without significant degradation.

Up to now gender-differences in visual inspection decision making have not been thoroughly investigated. We propose a machine learning approach to model male and female decisions with classifiers and base the analysis of gender-differences on the identified model parameters. A study with 50 male and 50 female subjects on a visual inspection task of stylized die-cast parts revealed significant gender-differences in the miss rate (p = 0.002), while differences in overall accuracy are not significant (p = 0.34). On a more detailed level, the application of classifier models shows gender differences are most prominent in the judgment of scratch lengths (p = 0.005). Our results suggest, that gender-differences in visual inspection are significant and that classifier-based modeling is a promising approach for analysis of these tasks.

First, we want to identify land covers for which the combination of extended spectral coverage and high spatial resolution provide a distinctive advantage in classification accuracy. Second, we perform predictor analyses to determine which combinations of bands are more effective in resolving individual targets. This experimental approach provides a basis for building a spectral atlas that can offer guidance on the optimal combination of WV2 spectral bands for different application areas.

Many such applications are now on the verge of providing too much video information reducing the ability to review, categorize, and process the immense amounts of video. Advancement in other technology areas such as Global Positioning System (GPS) processors and single board computers have paved the way for a new development of smart video sensors. A need exists to be able to identify stationary objects, such as buildings, and register their location back to the GIS database. Furthermore, transmitting large image streams from remote locations would quickly use available band width (BW) precipitating the need for processing to occur at the sensor location. This paper addresses the problem of automatic target recognition. Utilizing an Adaptive Resonance Theory approach to cluster templates of target buildings processing and memory requirements can be significantly reduced allowing for processing at the sensor. The results show that the network successfully classifies targets and their location in a virtual test bed environment eventually leading to autonomous and passive information processing.

Nonlinear relationship between water quality variables and SPOT5 spectrum are described by two support vector regression (SVR) models. Semi-supervised co-training algorithm for the two SVR models is established. The method is used for retrieving four representative water quality variables of the Weihe River in Shaanxi Province, China. The results show that the new method has better performance than the statistical regression method. Through integrating two SVR models and using unlabeled samples, an operational method when paired samples are limited is obtained. Combining techniques of machine learning and remote sensing, it provides an effective approach for remote sensing water quality retrieving.

CALIBRATING PROBABILITIES FOR HYPERSPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION OF ROCK TYPES	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	JUN 25-30, 2010	Honolulu, HI	IEEE				This paper investigates the performance of machine learning methods for classifying rock types from hyperspectral data. The main objective is to test the impact on classification error rate of calibrating the model's output into class probability estimates. The base classifiers included in this study are: boosted decision trees, support vector machines and logistic regression. The standard algorithm for some of these methods provides a non-probabilistic, hard decision as output. For those methods, posterior class probability estimates were approximated by fitting a sigmoid function to the classifier predictions. To perform multi-class classification, a one-versus-all approach was used. The different methods were compared using hyperspectral data acquired from ore-bearing rocks under different environmental conditions. The calibration of class probabilities improved the overall performance for almost all algorithms tested; an improvement of over 10% was observed in some cases.

In particular, we focus on two new paradigms: semisupervised and active learning. These two paradigms allow one to address classification problems in the critical conditions where the available labeled training samples are limited. These operational conditions are very usual in RS problems, due to the high cost and time associated with the collection of labeled samples. Semisupervised and active learning techniques allow one to enrich the initial training set information and to improve classification accuracy by exploiting unlabeled samples or requiring additional labeling phases from the user, respectively. The two aforementioned strategies are theoretically and experimentally analyzed considering SVM-based techniques in order to highlight advantages and disadvantages of both strategies.

In the following, this approach is assessed for use in hyperspectral image analysis. Two leading MIL algorithms are used in a classification experiment and results are compared to a state-of-the-art context-based classifier. Results indicate that using a MIL based approach may improve learned target models and subsequently classification results.

The two major physiological aspects associated with any activity are intensity of activity and associated fatigue. Fatigue is an universal human experience that can negatively affect daily life activities. In this paper, we present a framework to measure the level of fatigue and intensity of activity during repetitive daily life activities. The proposed framework acquires and processes time series data from a surface Electromyogram (sEMG) sensor and employs state of art machine learning and data mining techniques to measure the physiological status. We tested this framework using the raw sEMG signals from the hand muscles of 10 subjects, including male and female, of age group around 25 to 45 years, collected during the continuous monitoring of repetitive palm movements at different repetition speeds. The framework graded the levels of fatigue and intensity of activity in a scale of 0 to 1 with an accuracy of 88% with AdaBoost, 94% with SVM, 96% with both HMM and KNN based machine learning techniques.

A major question for Machine Learning is how to learn such good features automatically. Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) are a biologically-inspired trainable architecture that can learn invariant features. Each stage in a ConvNets is composed of a filter bank, some non-linearities, and feature pooling layers. With multiple stages, a ConvNet can learn multi-level hierarchies of features. While ConvNets have been successfully deployed in many commercial applications from OCR to video surveillance, they require large amounts of labeled training samples. We describe new unsupervised learning algorithms, and new non-linear stages that allow ConvNets to be trained with very few labeled samples. Applications to visual object recognition and vision navigation for off-road mobile robots are described.

The classification system first extracts and enhances a sensor pattern noise (SPN) from each image, which serves as the fingerprint of the camera that has taken the image. Secondly, it applies an unsupervised classifier trainer to a small training set of randomly selected SPNs to cluster the SPNs into classes and uses the centroids of those identified classes as the trained classifier. The classifier trainer treats each SPN as a random variable and uses Markov random field (MRF) approach to iteratively assigns a class label to each SPN (i.e., random variable) based on the class labels assigned to the members of a small set of SPNs, called membership committee, and the similarity values between it and the members of the membership committee until a stop criteria is met. The classifier trainer requires no a priori knowledge about the dataset from the user. Finally the image not included in the small training set are classified using the trained classifier depending on the similarity between their SPNs and the centroids of the trained classifier.

Reweighted trace minimization, which extends and improves upon the popular nuclear norm heuristic, has been used as an iterative heuristic for this problem. In this paper, we present theoretical guarantees for the reweighted trace heuristic. We quantify its improvement over nuclear norm minimization by proving tighter bounds on the recovery error for low-rank matrices with noisy measurements. Our analysis is based on the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and extends some recent results from Compressed Sensing. As a second contribution, we improve the existing RIP recovery results for the nuclear norm heuristic, and show that recovery happens under a weaker assumption on the RIP constants.

Based on this characteristics, the TSPs can be replaced into some shortest Hamiltonian path problems(SHPPs) of which solutions assemble a tour. This reduction is enabled by the calculation of convex hull and the classification of the cities not on the convex hull into the subsets of cities which construct SHPPs. This procedure means that the TSPs are equivalent to the classification problems, which leads to be able to apply existing methods of machine learning to the TSPs. We show that the teaching data for machine learning are available as the optimal classifications in the instances of which the optimal tour has been found.

A key step towards understanding the effect of retroviruses on hosts is identifying them in the host genome. Detecting retroviruses using sequence alignment is difficult because are very diverse and have high mutation rates. We propose a fast, accurate algorithm for detecting retroviruses that uses supervised machine learning and three sets of features. One set of novel features identify the characteristic reading frame structure of retroviruses. The other two sets include features that have been used by other researchers for exon finding. Our algorithm distinguishes retroviral genomes from non-coding sequences and endogenous retroviruses from non-coding sequences and from genes with high accuracy. It also distinguishes endogenous retroviruses from intact retroviral genomes, lentiviruses from other retroviruses, all with high accuracy.

Some of the actions other than walking locomotion, such as standing up from/sitting down on a chair, and bending over to slip through obstacles, taken by the pedestrians can be mostly seen at the particular locations where the objects and building facilities to induce the actions are placed. Conversely, by knowing the current location and its attribute about possibly taken actions, the action recognition process can be improved with the contextual information since prior knowledge about occurrence of actions is given as the attribute in the map. Additionally, when the posture (such as sitting, standing and getting to one knee) of the pedestrians is known, falsely recognized actions can be rejected. Experimental results show that accuracy of the action recognition on six types of the action (forward walking, backward walking, side stepping, sitting down on/standing up from a chair, going downstairs/upstairs and bending over) is more than 95% by cross validation test on the training data set, and the results also show that error rate of the PDR localization is reduced from 4% of the walking distance to 2% in the total scenario within the office environment by using the results of action recognition to adjust the estimated location.

In snowboarding, one of the fastest growing sports in the world, traditional activity recognition approaches make use of pressure insoles with force-sensitive resistors, which, however, are particularly uncomfortable to wear. To make these measurements more convenient, we have developed textile pressure sensors using the principle of a variable capacitor. Electrodes of conductive textiles coated with silver arranged on both sides of compressible spacers made from Croslite(TM) form a capacitor, whose capacitance indicates the applied pressure. We integrated three sensors into a snowboarding sock at relevant positions under the heel and the ball of the foot. Outdoor experiments on a ski slope in the Matterhorn Glacier Paradise (Zermatt, Switzerland) show that the machine learning algorithm NCC can detect turns, the basic activity of snowboarding, from the sensor data with an accuracy of 84 percent. Moreover, indoor experiments reveal that NCC can clearly distinguish whether a person wearing our sensor socks is standing on the ball of the foot, flat or on the heel. These results suggest the socks might also be used for gait analysis or the monitoring of the in-shoe pressure distribution of runners.

In order to identify a region of interest (RoI) in the monitoring area for the detection of any interesting mobile targets, we propose to use Bayesian machine learning and binary signal projection to extract the statistical contextual features from real-time, high-dimensional PSN data. This paper describes our recent results in this area, which include two aspects: (1) we have proposed to use binary principle component analysis (B-PCA) to interpret the relationship between observed sensor data and hidden context patterns. (2) We have conducted comprehensive experiments from real PSN sensor data to verify the context detection accuracy based on B-PCA models. Our results show that B-PCA can better capture context basis than general PCA algorithm(1).

However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.

The existing approaches to automating schema matching almost focus on computing direct element matches (1:1 matches) between two schemas. However, relationships between real-world schemas involve many complex matches besides 1:1 matches. A new complex schema matching system called NCSM is introduced in this paper. Firstly it can filter unreasonable matches on data types and values by preprocessor, and employs a set of special-purpose searchers in match generator to explore a specialized portion of the search space and discovers 1:1 and complex matches. Then it estimates candidate matches and selects optimal candidate matches by using similarity estimator and match selector respectively. Finally, according to the problem that there are opaque columns in the schemas being matched, it can apply complementary matcher to discover matching relations between opaque columns further more. Thereby it can discover more general, reasonable matching pairs. Experiments show that, NCSM does not only discover matches between schemas roundly, but also improve the matching recall and precision in practice.

Data mining is an inter-disciplinary field, whose core is at the intersection of machine learning, statistics and databases. A major objective of this work is to evaluate data mining tools in medical and health care applications to develop a tool that can help make timely and accurate decisions. One technique used in data mining is Classification where the desired output is a set of Rules or Statements that characterize the data. Within the rule induction paradigm, the algorithm used is Particle Swarm Optimization. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a heuristic technique suited for search of optimal solutions and based on the concept of swarm which were inspired in group dynamics and its synergy were originated from computer simulations of the coordinated motion. This proposed work is intended to develop Classification rules to extract data from historical or training data of patients which is developed into patterns relevant for diagnosis and suitable for quicker analysis, automated processing, thus reducing cost and helping to provide enhanced care and better cure.

Machine Learning Approach for Crude Oil Price Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks-Quantitative (ANN-Q) Model	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE				The volatility of crude oil market and its chain effects to the world economy augmented the interest and fear of individuals, public and private sectors. Previous statistical and econometric techniques used for prediction, offer good results when dealing with linear data. Nevertheless, crude oil price series deal with high nonlinearity and irregular events. The continuous usage of statistical and econometric techniques for crude oil price prediction might demonstrate demotions to the prediction performance. Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence approach through combination of historical quantitative data with qualitative data from experts' view and news is a remedy proposed to predict this. This paper will discuss the first part of the research, focusing on to (i) the development of Hierarchical Conceptual (HC) model and (ii) the development of Artificial Neural Networks-Quantitative (ANN-Q) model.

This algorithm prunes hidden neurons during the training process of ANNs according to their ranks computed with LZC. LZC extracts the number of unique patterns in a time sequence as a measure of rank. As a result, it is expected that LZC computes idleness or activeness of a hidden unit in training. The pruning is done on hidden nodes of three layered feed-forward neural network based on lowest LZC (lowest rank) of hidden neurons. This algorithm is similar to yet different from other so far existing pruning algorithms. One of the sub goals of this method is to quantify the complexity and topology of ANN. The SPA not only prunes hidden units but also facilitates to maintain complexity. The proposed SPA has been tested on a number of challenging benchmark problems in machine learning and ANNs, including Cancer, Diabetes, Heart disease, Card, and Glass identification problems. In order to justify the effectiveness of SPA we have developed a method which prunes hidden units randomly. In addition SPA is compared with variance analysis of sensitivity information based pruning method. The experimental results show that SPA can design compact ANN architectures with good generalization ability. The results also show that facilitating complexity and suppressing simplicity help the training to produce resourceful and functional network.

This fact is supported by experience, because well-known hold-out methods like cross-validation, leave-one-out, and the bootstrap usually achieve better results than the ones derived from MLT. We show in this paper that, in a small sample setting, i.e. when the dimensionality of the data is larger than the number of samples, a careful application of the MLT can outperform other methods in selecting the optimal hyperparameters of a SVM.

Ensembles of neural networks have traditionally been applied to machine learning and pattern recognition but more recently have been applied to forecasting of time series data. Several methods have been developed to produce neural network ensembles ranging from taking a simple average of individual model outputs to more complex methods such as bagging and boosting. Which ensemble method is best; what factors affect ensemble performance, under what data conditions are ensembles most useful and when is it beneficial to use ensembles over model selection are a few questions which remain unanswered. In this paper we present some initial findings using neural network ensembles based on the mean and median applied to forecast synthetic time series data. We vary factors such as the number of models included in the ensemble and how the models are selected, whether randomly or based on performance. We compare the performance of different ensembles to model selection and present the results.

On the Effectiveness of Discretization on Gene Selection of Microarray Data	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			CANCER CLASSIFICATION; EXPRESSION; TUMOR; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; PATTERNS	DNA microarray data is a challenging issue for machine learning researchers due to the high number of gene expression contained and the small samples sizes. To deal with this problem, feature selection methods, such as filters and wrappers, are typically applied to reduce the dimensionality. In this work, we apply a filter method before the classification and include a discretization step. The results obtained over ten different microarray data sets confirm the adequacy of the proposed method, that achieves better performances than the classifier alone. Besides, the combination method is also compared with the approaches of other authors (using wrappers and filters), outperforming the prediction accuracy and maintaining or even decreasing the number of genes required.

Semi-Supervised Learning from Imperfect Data through Particle Cooperation and Competition	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			UNLABELED DATA; CLASSIFICATION	In machine learning study, semi-supervised learning has received increasing interests in the last years. It is applied to classification problems where only a small portion of the data points is labeled. In these situations, the reliability of these labels is extremely important because it is common to have mislabeled samples in a data set and these may propagate their wrong labels to a large portion of the data set, resulting in major classification errors. In spite of its importance, wrong label propagation in semi-supervised learning has received little attention from researchers. In this paper we propose a particle walk semi-supervised learning method with both competitive and cooperative mechanisms. Then we study error propagation by applying the proposed model in modular networks. We show that the model is robust against mislabeled samples and it can produce good classification results even in the presence of considerable proportion of mislabeled data. Moreover, our numerical analysis uncover a critical point of mislabeled subset size, below which the network is free of wrong label contamination, but above which the mislabeled samples start to propagate their labels to the rest of the network. These studies have practical importance to design secure and robust machine learning techniques.

Therefore an automated tutoring system should be able to know whether a concept mentioned in a document is a prerequisite for studying that document, or it can be learned from it. This paper addresses the problem of identifying defined concepts and prerequisite concepts from learning resources in html format. In this paper a supervised machine learning approach was taken to address the problem, based on linguistic features which enclose contextual information and stylistic features such as font size and font weight. This paper shows that contextual information in addition to format information can give better results when used with the SVM classifier than with the (LP)(2) algorithm.

Urban traffic congestions lead to a lot of time consumption and exhaust emissions. So alleviating congested situation will have a good impact on both economy and environment. The signal control at urban intersections is an effective and most important way to reduce the traffic jams and collisions. A lot of control theories including traditional mathematical ways and modern artificial intelligent ways have been exploited. ADP is an effective and amiable intelligent control method. We proposed an algorithm to adjust the signal time plan at urban traffic intersections based on ADP theory. Simulations are taken under a microscopic traffic simulation software, TSIS(Traffic Software Integrated System). Several criteria named MOEs(Measures of Effectiveness) are collected to compare with the widely used pre-timed control, actuated control, also with a machine learning method Q-learning control. Results show that ADP control method have a better adaptability to the various traffic simulating real traffic flows.

Few studies try to characterize to which extent these aspects can influence the performance of the classification models induced. In this paper we compute different measures characterizing the complexity of gene expression data sets for cancer diagnosis. We then investigate how these measures relate to the classification performances achieved by support vector machines, a popular Machine Learning technique usually employed in the analysis of gene expression data. The results obtained indicate that some of the complexity indices utilized are indeed successful in explaining the difficulty involved in the classification of cancer gene expression data.

Artificial Immune Systems for Artificial Olfaction Data Analysis: Comparison between AIRS and ANN models	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			ELECTRONIC NOSE; SENSOR ARRAY; RECOGNITION; QUALITY; NETWORK	Artificial Olfaction (AO) data analysts have gained long term experience on nervous system based machine learning metaphors such as Artificial Neural Networks. In this work we propose and evaluate the use of a novel tool based on an emerging, however, powerful metaphor: the Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). AIS models were developed in the '90s; ever since they have reached significant maturity, and were to show good performance in both explorative data analysis and classification tasks. After selecting different artificial olfaction databases, we compare the utility of classic Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models with Artificial Immune Recognition Systems (AIRS) algorithms for classification problems, discussing its architectural strengths and weaknesses. Although BPNN retained a slight performance advantage on the investigated datasets, we were able to show that the AIS metaphor can express interesting characteristics for artificial olfaction data analysis. As an example, in a preliminary setup, the AIRS classifier showed superior performance when the sensor signals are affected by drift.

The Effect of Finite Sample Size on the Holdout Error Probability Estimator of Homoscedastic Multi-class Gaussian Classification Problems	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			MISCLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; REGRESSION	Consider a homoscedastic multi-class Gaussian classification problem where the class mean vectors and the common covariance matrix are not known to the practitioner. Rather, they are estimated from given sample vectors available for each class. In this paper, an empirical procedure for approximating the bias of the holdout estimator of the Bayesian error probability (BEP) is presented. Synthetic experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed procedure and how it can be used for guiding the practitioner about the necessary amount of data vectors required to achieve a certain level of accuracy in the BEP estimation. When applied to real world classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository, the proposed procedure was successfully used to estimate the test error probability based on the training data only. Moreover, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the proposed procedure predicted the test BEP when the amount of the training data in increased.

A Hierarchical GMDH-Based Polynomial Neural Network for Handwritten Numeral Recognition Using Topological Features	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			DIGIT RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIER; SYSTEM	We propose a multiclass hierarchical abductive learning classifier and apply it to improve the recognition rate of handwritten numerals while reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. For handwritten recognition, there are ten classes. Using 9 binary GMDH-based neural network models structured in a hierarchy has led to improving balance factor of the dataset for each classifier and improving the classification of handwritten numerals. It also has the advantage of removing the need to resolve classification ties that exist in other forms of combining a number of classifiers to solve a multiclass classification problem whether using one-versus-all or one-versus-one approaches. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated and compared with five other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers using a publicly available dataset based on non-Gaussian topological features.

There have been several researches in the sanitary and sociological field that show how these processes of breaking a life in common can deteriorate the health in both, the physic and the psychological, aspect. This paper presents the application of machine learning methods to be able to predict if a marriage, that has started a dissolution process, will end up in a friendly agreement or it will be taken to the court. In order to accomplish this task, Radial Basis F unction Neural Networks in combination with Mutual Information will be able to determine which elements should be considered to make a prediction. As the experiments will show, the methodology applied is able to classify with a high accuracy and robustness a real data base. The results could be applied in order to prevent some traumas to the people involved in the dissolution in the medical aspect and to perform a better management in the legal aspects.

However, this conflicts with the highly sensitive recording techniques used for BCIs, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques are required to decorrelate desired brain signals from the rest. This paper proposes a signal processing pipeline and two classification methods suitable for multiclass EEG analysis. The methods were tested in an experiment on separating left/right hand imagery in presence/absence of speech. The analyses showed that the presence of speech during motor imagery did not affect the classification accuracy significantly and regardless of the presence of speech, the proposed methods were able to separate left and right hand imagery with an accuracy of 60%. The best overall accuracy achieved for the 5-class separation of all the tasks was 47% and both proposed methods performed equally well. In addition, the analysis of event-related spectral power changes revealed characteristics related to motor imagery and speech.

Examples include handwriting and speech recognition, document classification, vision tasks, drug design using recombinant molecules and protein engineering. Such problems might be tackled from different angles: learning from unlabeled data or active learning. In the former case, the algorithms must satisfy themselves with the limited amount of labeled data and capitalize on the unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning methods. Several challenges have addressed this problem in the past. In the latter case, the algorithms may place a limited number of queries to get new sample labels. The goal in that case is to optimize the queries and the problem is referred to as active learning. While the problem of active learning is of great importance, organizing a challenge in that area is non trivial. This is the problem we have addressed, and we describe our approach in this paper. The "active learning" challenge is part of the WCCI 2010 competition program (http://www.wcci2010.org/competition-program).

One of these aspects is related to unbalanced classes in which the number of observations belonging to a class, greatly exceeds the observations in other classes. We propose in this paper an under-sampling method which uses self-organizing map to cluster the majority class guided with minority class. The proposed approach has been validated on multiple data sets using decision trees as a classifier with cross validation. The experimental results showed that elimination from majority class by integrating Neighborhood Cleaning Rule in SOM algorithm, produce high and very promising performance.

Bio-inspired Computer Visual System using GPU and Visual Pattern Assessment Language (ViPAL): Application on Breast Cancer Prognosis	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			PRIMATE CONE PATHWAYS; 2ND-ORDER FEATURES; CORTEX; ORIENTATION; 1ST-ORDER; IMAGES; MODEL; SHAPE	Bio-inspired computer vision is an emerging field. It aims to reproduce the capabilities of biological vision systems, eventually to simulate the visual functions for various purposes. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired computer visual system using Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), and its application on breast cancer prognosis. The system extracts visual features from an input image using a mechanism which is similar to human visual system. Then classify the visual features using a machine learning algorithm. As a result, the elements of the input image, which might be related to particular knowledge concepts, can be identified. In order to operate the bio-inspired computer visual system, in this work, a new computer language, named Visual Pattern Assessment Language (ViPAL), is proposed. The ViPAL provides a shell between the bio-inspired computer visual system and the users. The complexity of the low-level image feature assessment can be managed by the shell. As a result, the workload of the users can be reduced. Based on the bio-inspired computer visual system and the ViPAL, we propose an application for breast cancer prognosis in order to support the works of the pathologists. A well-trained pathologist usually can complete the analysis of a biopsy in 10 to 30 seconds. However, in a big medical institute, sometimes a pathologist need to analyse more than 100 biopsies per day. Hence, in order to support their works, we implemented an application of breast cancer diagnosis. The system thus roughly simulated the decision-making as the procedures of the breast cancer prognosis.

As agents in a virtual world roam, interact and socialize with users and other agents as in real world without explicit goals and teachers, learning in virtual world presents many challenges not found in typical machine learning benchmarks. In this paper, we highlight the unique issues and challenges of building learning agents in virtual world using reinforcement learning. Specifically, a self- organizing neural model, named TD-FALCON (Temporal Difference - Fusion Architecture for Learning and Cognition), is deployed, which enables an autonomous agent to adapt and function in a dynamic environment with immediate as well as delayed evaluative feedback signals. We have implemented and evaluated TD-FALCON agents as virtual tour guides in a virtual world environment. Our experimental results show that the agents are able to adapt and improve their performance in real time. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few in-depth works on building complete learning agents that adapt their behaviors through real time reinforcement learning in virtual world.

These algorithms allow to compute the entire path of solutions for every value of regularization parameter using the fact that their solution paths have piecewise linear form. In this paper, we propose nonlinear regularization path for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a modified Huber loss. We first show that the solution path of the modified Huber loss SVM is represented as piecewise nonlinear function. Since the solutions between two breakpoints are characterized by a rational function, the breakpoint itself can be identified solving the rational equations. Then we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to solve these rational equations with quadratic convergence rate. Note that our algorithm is NOT a predictor-corrector type method that can only follow nonlinear regularization path with rough approximation. We show the algorithm performance on some artificial and real data sets	[Karasuyama, Masayuki; Takeuchi, Ichiro] Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Engn, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan	Karasuyama, M (reprint author), Nagoya Inst Technol, Dept Engn, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, Japan.	krsym@goat.ics.nitech.ac.jp; takeuchi.ichiro@nitech.ac.jp					Allgower E.L., 1993, ACTA NUMERICA, V2, P1, DOI 10.1017/S0962492900002336; ANDERSON E., 1999, LAPACK USERS GUIDE; BACH FR, 2005, ADV NEURAL INFORM PR, V17, P73; Bartlett PL, 2007, J MACH LEARN RES, V8, P775; Bo LF, 2007, NEURAL COMPUT, V19, P1082, DOI 10.1162/neco.2007.19.4.1082; Bottou L., 2007, LARGE SCALE KERNEL M, P301; BUNCH J, 1979, NUMER MATH, V31, P31; Chang C.-C., 2001, LIBSVM LIB SUPPORT V; Chapelle O, 2007, NEURAL COMPUT, V19, P1155, DOI 10.1162/neco.2007.19.5.1155; Chu W, 2004, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V15, P29, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2003.820830; Gal T., 1995, POSTOPTIMAL ANAL PAR; Golub G.

In particular (and, due to their superior results) it focuses on a novel design of locally linear support vector machines classifiers. It presents them as powerful alternatives to the global (over the whole input space) nonlinear classifiers. Locally linear support vector machine (LL SVM) maximizes the margin in the original input features space and it never performs the nonlinear mapping to some kernel induced feature space. In performing such a task it uses only the K closest points to the query data point q. In this way it grasps the local decision function better than the standard global SVM does. This is shown to be a powerful approach when data are unevenly distributed in the input space and when a suitable decision function possesses different nonlinear characteristics in various parts of the input space. Experiments on eleven benchmark data sets display both the superior performance of LL SVMs as well as great performances of other classic locally linear classifiers. In addition, this is the first paper which proves the stability bounds for local SVMs and it shows that they are tighter than the ones for traditional, global, SVM. LL SVM is a natural classifier for multiclass problems which means that it can be easily adopted for solving regression tasks.

A novel working set selection mechanism is proposed to improve Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. Implementation is based on the Keerthi et al.'s SMO algorithm, but our approach is one-class classification. When selecting samples for the optimization process, much effort is spent to find the most violating pair. The training time strongly depends on the selection of these variables. By choosing the neighbor samples of the updating pair (current working set) one can reach the optimal solution much faster. This one-class classification approach will be applied to a text categorization problem using the pointwise total correlation for term indexing.

Time-series Temporal Classification using Feature Ensemble Learning	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE				Time series data classification is important in many applications. Learning temporal knowledge in time series data is challenging. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning algorithm, Feature Ensemble (FE), to learn effective subsequences of signal features distributed over time series data streams. Both the FE learning and the FE classification have been applied to an application problem. Our empirical results strongly suggest that FE learning is an effective technique for time series data classification.

Although they have many attractive features interpretation of their solutions is quite difficult, the use of a single kernel type may not be appropriate in all areas of the input space, convergence problems for some kernels are not uncommon, the standard quadratic programming solution has O(m(3)) time and O(m(2)) space complexity for m training patterns. Kernel methods work because they implicitly provide new, useful features. Such features, derived from various kernels and other vector transformations, may be used directly in any machine learning algorithm, facilitating multiresolution, heterogeneous models of data. Therefore Support Feature Machines (SFM) based on linear models in the extended feature spaces, enabling control over selection of support features, give at least as good results as any kernel-based SVMs, removing all problems related to interpretation, scaling and convergence. This is demonstrated for a number of benchmark datasets analyzed with linear discrimination, SVM, decision trees and nearest neighbor methods.

BP is based on gradient descent, thus it converges to a local optimum in the region of the initial solution. Meanwhile, the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) always look for global optimum, however their ability of local search is not as good as the BP algorithm. This paper presents a hybrid system that uses differential evolution with global and local neighborhoods (DEGL), which is a variant of differential evolution (DE), to search for a suitable architecture and a near-optimal set of initial connection weights, and then performs the Levenberg-Marquadt training algorithm, which is a more robust variation of BP, to perform local search from these initial weights. Finally, it is performed a comparison of the performance of the hybrid system DEGL+ANN with the hybrid system DE+ANN and the raw RNA, for classification problems using machine learning benchmarks.

When learning from highly imbalanced data, most classifiers are overwhelmed by the majority class examples, so the false negative rate is always high. Although researchers have introduced many methods to deal with this problem, including resampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning (CSL), most of them focus on either of these techniques. This study presents two empirical methods that deal with class imbalance using both resampling and CSL. The first method combines and compares several sampling techniques with CSL using support vector machines (SVM). The second method proposes using CSL by optimizing the cost ratio (cost matrix) locally. Our experimental results on 18 imbalanced datasets from the UCI repository show that the first method can reduce the misclassification costs, and the second method can improve the classifier performance.

The proposed algorithm is employed for the robust neural network training purpose. The quasi-Newton method was studied as one of the most efficient optimization algorithms based on the gradient descent and used as the batch training method of neural networks. On the other hand, the stochastic (online) quasi-Newton method was developed as an algorithm for the machine learning. In this paper the stochastic quasi-Newton training algorithm is improved for robust neural network training. Neural network training for some benchmark problems is presented to demonstrate the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, neural network training for microwave circuit modeling, such as the waveguide and the microstrip examples is presented, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm achieves more accurate models than both the batch and the stochastic quasi-Newton methods.

A Generic Approach for Learning Performance Assessment Functions	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE				This paper presents a generic machine learning based approach to devise performance assessment functions for any kind of optimization problem. The need of a performance assessment process taking into account robustness of the solutions is stressed and a general methodology for devising a function to estimate such a performance on any given engineering problem is formalized. This methodology is used as basis to train machine learning models capable of assessing performance of real world time series classification algorithms through the use of ratings from expert engineers as training data. Although the methodology presented is used on a time series classification problem, it possesses generic validity and can be easily applied to devise arbitrary scalar performance functions for complex multi-objective problems as well. The trained machine learning models can be understood as performance assessment functions that, having learned the engineer's "gut instinct", are able to assess robustness performance in a much more objective way than a human expert could do.

In this paper, we present an Intelligent Power Controller, UMD_IPC, trained with a machine learning approach to provide optimal power flow for in-vehicle operations. The UMD_IPC is implemented in a HEV model provided by PSAT simulation environment, and its performances on three drive cycles are close to the optimal results generated by Dynamic Programming.

These challenges forces to develop new algorithms that are able to deal with changes in the underlying problem to be learnt. These changes can be gradual or abrupt. As the dynamics of the changes can be different, the existing machine learning algorithms exhibit difficulties to cope with them. In this work we propose a new method, that is based in the introduction of a forgetting function in an incremental online learning algorithm for two-layer feedforward neural networks. This forgetting function gives a monotonically crescent importance to new data. Due to this fact, the network forgets in presence of changes while maintaining a stable behavior when the context is stationary. The theoretical basis for the method is given and its performance is illustrated by evaluating its behavior. The results confirm that the proposed method is able to work in evolving environments.

Additionally, most of the times where SSL techniques can be deployed, only a small portion of samples in the data set is labeled. To deal with such situations in a straightforward fashion, in this paper we introduce a semi-supervised learning approach based on neuronal synchrony in a network of coupled integrate-and-fire neurons. For that, we represent the input data set as a graph and model each of its nodes by an integrate-and-fire neuron. Thereafter, we propagate the class labels from the seed samples to unlabeled samples through the graph by means of the emerging synchronization dynamics. Experimentations on synthetic and real data show that the introduced technique achieves good classification results regardless the feature space distribution or geometrical shape.

The approach is based on creating atomic and non-atomic clusters at different levels, training of weak classifiers on overlapping clusters and fusion of their decisions. The subsets of data are obtained by clustering of original training data sets into multiple partitions. As each partition represents highly correlated patterns from different classes, the proposed approach trains weak classifiers on difficult-to-classify patterns and combines the decision at various levels. The approach is tested on six benchmark datasets from UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the proposed approach achieves better classification accuracy than the existing approaches.			a.rahman@cqu.edu.au; b.verma@cqu.edu.au	Rahman, Ashfaqur/J-8019-2012				Breiman L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1010933404324; Breiman L, 1999, MACH LEARN, V36, P85, DOI 10.1023/A:1007563306331; Breiman L, 1996, MACH LEARN, V24, P123, DOI 10.1007/BF00058655; Chen L, 2009, PATTERN RECOGN, V42, P629, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2008.09.003; DRUCKER H, 1994, NEURAL COMPUT, V6, P1289, DOI 10.1162/neco.1994.6.6.1289; Freund Y, 1997, J COMPUT SYST SCI, V55, P119, DOI 10.1006/jcss.1997.1504; Hall M., 2009, SIGKDD EXPLORATIONS, V11; Ko AHR, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN, V40, P2198, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2007.01.031; Muhlbaier MD, 2009, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V20, P152, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2008.2008326; Nanni L, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN, V39, P488, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2005.10.002; Parikh D, 2007, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V37, P437, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2006.883873; Pedrajas N.G., 2009, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V20, P258; Polikar R., 2006, IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine, V6, DOI 10.1109/MCAS.2006.1688199; Rodriguez JJ, 2008, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V29, P1049, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2007.06.019; SCHAPIRE RE, 1990, MACH LEARN, V5, P197, DOI 10.1023/A:1022648800760; UCI, UCI MACH LEARN DAT	16	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1098-7576	978-1-4244-6917-8	IEEE IJCNN			2010												7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BTN74	WOS:000287421400064

In particular, in nancial applications containing thousands of high-dimensional samples, machine learning techniques such as neural networks are often used. One of their main limitations is that the learning phase can be extremely consuming due to the long training times required which constitute a hard bottleneck for their use in practice. Thus their implementation in graphics hardware is highly desirable as a way to speed up the training process. In this paper we present a bankruptcy prediction model based on the parallel implementation of the Multiple BackPropagation (MBP) algorithm which is tested on a real data set of French companies (healthy and bankrupt). Results by running the MBP algorithm in a sequential processing CPU version and in a parallel GPU implementation show reduced computational costs with respect to the latter while yielding very competitive performance.

A typical example of them is control of rhythmic behaviors by Central Pattern Generator (CPG). However, this control has a problem that there are few theories to determine parameters of CPG. For this reason, they are determined experimentally. In this paper, we propose a combination method of Genetic Algorithm and Reinforcement Learning for determining parameters of CPG, and apply to a quadruped robot with the CPG controller.

The self-adapting nature of QiSNN due to the simultaneous optimization of network parameters and feature subsets represents a highly desirable characteristic in the context of machine learning and knowledge discovery. In this paper, the evolution of the parameters and feature subsets is studied in detail. The goal of this analysis is a comprehensive understanding of all parameters involved in QiSNN and some practical guidelines for using the method in future research and applications. We also highlight the role of the employed neural encoding technique along with its impact on the classification abilities of QiSNN.

Rule-Based Classification Approach for Railway Wagon Health Monitoring	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE		Railway wagons; classification algorithms; rule-based learning; WEKA	ALGORITHMS; PREDICTION	Modern machine learning techniques have encouraged interest in the development of vehicle health monitoring systems that ensure secure and reliable operations of rail vehicles. In an earlier study, an energy-efficient data acquisition method was investigated to develop a monitoring system for railway applications using modern machine learning techniques, more specific classification algorithms. A suitable classifier was proposed for railway monitoring based on relative weighted performance metrics. To improve the performance of the existing approach, a rule-based learning method using statistical analysis has been proposed in this paper to select a unique classifier for the same application. This selected algorithm works more efficiently and improves the overall performance of the railway monitoring systems. This study has been conducted using six classifiers, namely REPTree, J48, Decision Stump, IBK, PART and OneR, with twenty-five datasets. The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) learning tool has been used in this study to develop the prediction models.	[Shafiullah, G.

S	Starzyk, JA; Raif, P; Tan, AH			IEEE	Starzyk, Janusz A.; Raif, Pawel; Tan, Ah-Hwee			Mental Development and Representation Building through Motivated Learning	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			SYSTEMS	Motivated learning is a new machine learning approach that extends reinforcement learning idea to dynamically changing, and highly structured environments. In this approach a machine is capable of defining its own objectives and learns to satisfy them though an internal reward system. The machine is forced to explore the environment in response to externally applied negative (pain) signals that it must minimize. In doing so, it discovers relationships between objects observed through its sensory inputs and actions it performs on the observed objects. Observed concepts are not predefined but are emerging as a result of successful operations. For the optimum development of concepts and related skills, the machine operates in the protective environment that gradually increases its complexity. Simulation illustrates the advantage of this gradual increase in environment complexity for machine development. Comparison to reinforcement learning indicates weakness of the later method in learning proper behavior, even in such protective environments with gradually increasing complexity. The method shows how mental development stimulates learning of new concepts and at the same time benefits from this learning. Thus the method addresses a well know problem of merging connectionist (bottom-up) and symbolic (top down) approaches for intelligent autonomous machine operation in developmental robotics.

In this paper, we develop an efficient dimensionality reduction method named MiniRisk Supervised Discrimiant Projection (MRSDP), which extracts effective low-dimensional features for classification purpose. The proposed method utilizes discriminant information to guide the procedure of extracting intrinsic low-dimensional features and provides a linear projection matrix. Since MRSDP is based on minimax risk criterion, it can minimize the maximal probability of misclassification in the common borders of different classes of data by contracting within-class scatter and maximizing between-class scatter. The advantage of our method is borne out by comparison with other widely used methods. In the experiments on Yale face database and ORL face database, our method achieves constantly superior performance than those competing methods.

Recently a large number of studies have attempted to improve clustering by combing multiple clustering solutions into a single consolidated clustering ensemble that has the best performance among given clustering solutions. However, the different clustering ensembles have their own behaviors on data of various characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to data clustering by constructing a clustering ensemble iteratively based on partitions generated on training subsets sampled from the original dataset. To yield a robust clustering ensemble our approach employs a hybrid sampling scheme inspired by both boosting and bagging techniques originally proposed for supervised learning. Our approach has been evaluated on synthetic data and real-world motion trajectory data sets, and experimental results demonstrate that it yields satisfactory performance for a variety of clustering tasks.

One challenge to constructing accurate reservoir models is the time required to carry out a large number of computer simulations. To address this issue, we have constructed surrogate models (proxies) for the computer simulator to reduce the simulation time. The quality of the proxies, however, relies on the quality of the computer simulation data. Frequently, the majority of the simulation outputs match poorly to the production data collected from the field. In other words, most of the data describe the characteristics of what the reservoir is not (negative samples), rather than what the reservoir is (positive samples). Applying machine learning methods to train a simulator proxy based on these data faces the challenge of imbalanced training data. This work applies active learning support vector machines to incrementally select a subset of informative simulation data to train a classifier as the simulator proxy. We compare the results with the results produced by the standard support vector machines combined with other imbalanced training data handling techniques. Based on the support vectors in the trained classifiers, we analyze high impact parameters that separating good-matching reservoir models from bad-matching models.

Depend on these main findings correlated with MS, we attempt to develop an EEG based classification system to automatically classify subject's MS level and find the suitable EEG features via common feature extraction, selection and classifiers technologies in this study. If we can find the regulations and then develop an algorithm to predict MS occurring, it would be a great benefit to construct a safe and comfortable environment for all drivers and passengers when they are cruising in the car, bus, ship or airplane. EEG is one of the best methods for monitoring the brain dynamics induced by motion-sickness because of its high temporal resolution and portability. After collecting the EEG signals and subjective MS level in a realistic driving environment, we first do the data pre-processing part including ICA, component clustering analysis and time-frequency analysis. Then we adopt three common feature extractions and two feature selections (FE/FS) technologies to extract or select the correlated features such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), nonparametric weighted feature extraction (NWFE), forward feature selections (FFS) and backward feature selections (BFS) and feed the feature maps into three classifiers (Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier (ML), k-Nearest-Neighbor Classifier (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Experimental results show that classification performance of all our proposed technologies can be reached almost over 95%. It means it is possible to apply the effective technology combination to predict the subject's MS level in the real life applications. The better combination in this study is using LDA and Gaussian based ML classifier. This advantage can be widely used in machine learning area for developing the prediction algorithms in the future.

We give the first distributed algorithms with provable guarantees in the physical model, and show how they can be generalized to more complicated metrics and settings in which the physical assumptions are slightly violated. We also give the first algorithms in the protocol model that do not assume transmitters can coordinate with their neighbors in the interference graph, so every transmitter chooses whether to broadcast based purely on local events. Our techniques draw heavily from algorithmic game theory and machine learning theory, even though our goal is a distributed algorithm. Indeed, our main results allow every transmitter to run any algorithm it wants, so long as its algorithm has a learning-theoretic property known as no-regret in a game-theoretic setting.

Eugene			On Constructing Efficient Shared Decision Trees for Multiple Packet Filters	2010 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM	IEEE INFOCOM		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on IEEE INFOCOM	MAR 15-19, 2010	San Diego, CA	IEEE		Packet filter; packet classification; data structure; virtual router; HyperCuts		Multiple packet filters serving different purposes (e.g., firewalling, QoS) and different virtual routers are often deployed on a single physical router. The HyperCuts decision tree is one efficient data structure for performing packet filter matching in software. Constructing a separate HyperCuts decision tree for each packet filter is not memory efficient. A natural alternative is to construct shared HyperCuts decision trees to more efficiently support multiple packet filters. However, we experimentally show that naively classifying packet filters into shared HyperCuts decision trees may significantly increase the memory consumption and the height of the trees. To help decide which subset of packet filters should share a HyperCuts decision tree, we first identify a number of important factors that collectively impact the efficiency of the resulted shared HyperCuts decision tree. Based on the identified factors, we then propose to use machine learning techniques to predict whether any pair of packet filters should share a tree. Given the pair-wise prediction matrix, a greedy heuristic algorithm is used to classify packets filters into a number of shared HyperCuts decision trees. Our experiments using both real packets filters and synthetic packet filters show that the shared HyperCuts decision trees consume considerably less memory.	[Zhang, Bo; Ng, T. S.

An effective ensemble should consist of a set of learners that are both accurate and diverse. In the training stage, we use the Adaboost. R2 technique to train several weak learners (multi layer perceptron network-MLP) to increase the diversity of the individual models. In the prediction stage, we focus on the design of the fusion of the weak learner ensemble. In contrast with the traditional static weight a location method based on the over all data set, we propose a dynamic weight allocation method, based on the performance of an individual weak learner on the subset. The idea be hind this method was to use a test sample's neighbors to estimate the accuracy and bias of the individual weak learner when the learner is used to make the prediction. An improved hyperrectangle neighborhood defining method is proposed in this paper. Some experiments using MLP neural network as a weak learner on a NASA turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset were carried out. The preliminary empirical comparisons showed higher performance of the novel ensemble learning methodology for the R UL estimation of engineering systems.

The presented framework proposes an hybrid cognitive architecture that relies on subsumption theory and includes some important extensions. These extensions can be condensed in inclusion of learning capabilities through bio-inspired reinforcement machine learning systems, an evolutionary mechanism based on gene expression programming to self-configure the behaviour arbitration between layers, a co-evolutionary mechanism to evolve behaviour repertories in a parallel fashion and finally, an aggregation mechanism to combine the learning algorithms outputs to improve the learning quality and increase the robustness and fault tolerance ability of the cognitive agent. The proposed architecture was proved in an animat environment using a multi-agent platform where several learning capabilities and emergent properties for self-configuring internal agent's architecture arise.

Cancer prognosis estimates recurrence of disease and predict survival of patient; hence resulting in improved patient management. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are shown to be powerful tools for analyzing data sets where there are complicated nonlinear interactions between the input data and the information to be predicted. In this paper, we have targeted this strength of SVMs to analyze the potential of classification through feature vectors for predicting the survival chances of a breast cancer patient. Experiments were performed using different types of SVM algorithms analyzing their classification efficiency using different kernel parameters. SEER breast cancer data set (1973-2003), the most comprehensible source of information on cancer incidence in United States, is considered. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy parameters along with RoC curves have been used to explain the performance of each SVM algorithm with different kernel types.

Continuous Search comes in two modes: the functioning mode solves the user's problem instances using the current heuristics model; the exploration mode reuses these instances to train and improve the heuristics model through Machine Learning during the computer idle time. Contrasting with previous approaches, Continuous Search thus does not require that the representative instances needed to train a good heuristics model be available beforehand. It achieves lifelong learning, gradually becoming an expert on the user's problem instance distribution. Experimental validation suggests that Continuous Search can design efficient mixed strategies after considering a moderate number of problem instances.

Automatic image annotation with image semantic content has attracted increasing attention, as it is the preprocess of annotation based image retrieval which provides users accurate, efficient, and convenient image retrieval with image understanding. Different machine learning approaches have been used to tackle the problem of automatic image annotation; however, most of them focused on exploring the relationship between images and annotation words and neglected the relationship among the annotation words. In this paper, we propose a framework of using language models to represent the word-to-word relation and thus to improve the performance of existing image annotation approaches utilizing probabilistic models. We also propose a specific language model - the semantic similarity language model to estimate the semantic similarity among the annotation words so that annotations that are more semantically coherent will have higher probability to be chosen to annotate the image. To illustrate the general idea of using language model to improve current image annotation systems, we added the language model on top of the two specific image annotation models - the translation model (TM) and the cross media relevance model (CMRM). We tested the improved models on a widely used image annotation corpus - the Corel 5K dataset. Our results show that by adding the semantic similarity language model, the performance of image annotation improves significantly in comparison with the original models. Our proposed language model can also be applied to other image annotation approaches using word probability conditioned on image or word-image joint probability as well.

This paper presents a process involving a feature selection technique for selecting the important attributes and a data sampling technique for addressing class imbalance. The application domain of this study is software engineering, more specifically, software quality prediction using classification models. When using feature selection and data sampling together, different scenarios should be considered. The four possible scenarios are: (1) feature selection based on original data, and modeling (defect prediction) based on original data; (2) feature selection based on original data, and modeling based on sampled data; (3) feature selection based on sampled data, and modeling based on original data; and (4) feature selection based on sampled data, and modeling based on sampled data. The research objective is to compare the software defect prediction performances of models based on the four scenarios. The case study consists of nine software measurement data sets obtained from the PROMISE software project repository. Empirical results suggest that feature selection based on sampled data performs significantly better than feature selection based on original data, and that defect prediction models perform similarly regardless of whether the training data was formed using sampled or original data.

Is it less efficient for multi class problems? To answer the questions, an experimental set up was realized that uses three high dimensional data sets. Our results are that, depending on the mechanisms controlling confinement and dispersion in the PSO algorithm, the classification accuracy varied with the dimensionality of the data and the cardinality of the output space.

A mode can be min, max, + (input), - (output), or nt (non-tabled). While the traditional table-all approach to tabling is good for finding all answers, mode-directed tabling is well suited to dynamic programming problems that require selective answers. In this paper, we present three application examples of mode-directed tabling, namely, (1) hydraulic system planning, a dynamic programming problem, (2) the Viterbi algorithm in PRISM, a probabilistic logic reasoning and learning system, and (3) constraint checking in evaluating Answer Set Programs (ASP). For the Viterbi application, the feature of enabling a cardinality limit in a table mode declaration plays an important role. For a PRISM program and a set of data, the explanations may be too large to be completely stored and the cardinality limit allows for Viterbi inference based on a subset of explanations. The mode nt, which specifies an argument that can participate in the computation of a tabled predicate but is never tabled either in subgoal or answer tabling, is useful in constraint checking for the Hamilton cycle problem encoded as an ASP.

The learning procedure is performed by means of a expectation maximization (EM) methodology. The key feature of our approach is related to a top-down hierarchical search for the number of components, together with the integration of the model selection criterion within a modified EM procedure, used for the learning the mixture parameters. We start with a single component covering the whole data set. Then new components are added and optimized to best cover the data. The process is recursive and builds a binary tree like structure that effectively explores the search space. We show that our approach is faster that state-of-the-art alternatives, is insensitive to initialization, and has better data fits in average. We elucidate this through a series of experiments, both with synthetic and real data.

Within networks research, inferring the structure of unknown networks is often a key problem; e. g. of genetic regulatory networks. However, there are very few well-known biological networks, and good simulation is essential for validating and evaluating novel structural inference techniques. Further, the importance of large, genome-wide structural inference is increasingly recognised, but there does not appear to be a good simulator available for large networks. This paper presents GREENSIM, a simulator that helps address this gap. GREENSIM automatically generates large, genome-size networks with more biologically realistic structural characteristics and 2nd-order non-linear regulatory functions. The simulator itself and the novel method used for generating a network structure with appropriate in-and out-degree distributions may also generalise easily to other types of network.

The gait of the user is captured with the motion capture system, which consists of tags attached to the body and sensors situated in the apartment. Position of the tags is acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with dynamic time warping and machine learning algorithms in order to identify the specific gait anomaly. We designed medically oriented features for training a machine learning classifier that classifies the user's gait into: i) normal, ii) with hemiplegia, iii) with Parkinson's disease, iv) with pain in the back and v) with pain in the leg. Experimental results show that the proposed tool is usable for discovery of gait anomalies.

We conducted a comprehensive empirical study on support vector methods for ML-based MT evaluation involving multi-class support vector machines (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR) with different kernel functions. We empathize on a systematic comparison study of multiple feature models obtained with feature selection and feature extraction techniques. Besides finding the conditions yielding the best empirical results, our study supports several unobvious conclusions regarding qualitative and quantitative aspects of feature sets in MT evaluation.

Managing Uncertainty of XML Schema Matching	26TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA ENGINEERING ICDE 2010	IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	26th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010)	MAR 01-06, 2010	Long Beach, CA	IEEE, Micorsoft, IBM, Greenplum, at&t, ESRI, Google, Oracle, SAP, Yahoo, NSF				Despite of advances in machine learning technologies, a schema matching result between two database schemas (e.g., those derived from COMA++) is likely to be imprecise. In particular, numerous instances of "possible mappings" between the schemas may be derived from the matching result. In this paper, we study the problem of managing possible mappings between two heterogeneous XML schemas. We observe that for XML schemas, their possible mappings have a high degree of overlap. We hence propose a novel data structure, called the block tree, to capture the commonalities among possible mappings. The block tree is useful for representing the possible mappings in a compact manner, and can be generated efficiently. Moreover, it supports the evaluation of probabilistic twig query (PTQ), which returns the probability of portions of an XML document that match the query pattern. For users who are interested only in answers with k-highest probabilities, we also propose the top-k PTQ, and present an efficient solution for it. The second challenge we have tackled is to efficiently generate possible mappings for a given schema matching. While this problem can be solved by existing algorithms, we show how to improve the performance of the solution by using a divide-and-conquer approach. An extensive evaluation on realistic datasets show that our approaches significantly improve the efficiency of generating, storing, and querying possible mappings.

However, it is increasingly important not just to measure overall expression of specific molecules, but also their spatial distribution-at various scales and while preserving cellular and tissue architectural features. Such high-resolution molecular imaging is technically challenging, especially when signals of interest are co-localized. Moreover, in fluorescence-based methods, sensitivity and quantitative reliability can be compromised by spectral cross-talk between specific labels and also by the presence of autofluorescence commonly present, for example, in formalin-fixed tissues. In brightfield microscopy, problems of overlapping chromogenic signals pose similar imaging difficulties. These challenges can be addressed using commercially available multispectral imaging technologies attached to standard microscope platforms, or alternatively, integrated into whole-slide scanning instruments. However, image analysis is a central and still incompletely solved piece of the entire imaging process. New and evolving machine-learning technologies as well as other image-understanding approaches can create tools that can readily be used to separate image regions into appropriate classes ("cancer", "stroma", "inflammation", e.g.) with (near) clinically acceptable accuracy. By itself this is useful, but can also be combined with specific segmentation and quantitation tools to extract molecular data automatically from appropriate cellular and tissue compartments, information necessary for designing and testing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic reagents. Having tools such as these available will allow pathologists to deliver appropriate quantitative and multiplexed analyses in a reproducible and timely manner.

Class Label is often used as the supervised information for supervised feature selection algorithm while constraints are rarely used. So, an effective feature selection algorithm with pairwise constraints called Constraints Score was proposed. But its performance still is limited by neglecting the correlation between features. In this paper we improve this algorithm by considering the correlation between features and using SVM density estimation, mutual information to measure the correlation and further eliminate the feature redundancy. Experiments show the effectiveness of our improved algorithm.

Based on knowledge representation using partition granularity, an algorithm is proposed in the paper, which is more intuitive, easier to understand, and to implement on the computer. Compared with entropy-based information systems attribute reduction, the algorithm reduces the complexity of calculating the entropy.

The machine learning algorithms generally need a large amount of L2 learner sentences as training data for constructing an automatic evaluation system. Even though various L2 learner corpora have been developed, it is still not easy to obtain a large amount of L2 learner sentences. A solution for this problem is to substitute machine translation (MT) sentences for L2 learner sentences, because MT sentences involve errors such that L2 learners often make. In this paper, we examine whether MT sentences can be used as alternative training data for L2 learner sentences. Given this, we constructed automatic evaluation systems: one is constructed with L2 learner sentences as training data and the other is constructed with MT sentences as training data. We compared these systems, and assessed the validity of these evaluation systems. Through the experiment, we found that MT sentences differ from L2 learner sentences for the adequacy of training data.

Expert systems are a type of software designed to clarify uncertainties in areas that typically involve a human expert. In college courses, the instructors usually make the decision to adopt classroom materials, assignments, and teaching methods for their courses. However, instructors may encounter difficulty in determining whether their choices are effective or synergistic with each other. Our work aims to produce an artificially intelligent evaluation system which can find and produce inferences in student survey data using concepts from expert system design, data mining, and machine learning, then report those findings in a human-readable format to aid decision makers. Instructors from several institutions are testing our software and user experiences have been captured to help guide further development. Our findings give us confidence that a system of this type can benefit educators and students in decision making. For example, by informing the users of positive and negative relations which arise from our class measures; instructors can consider adopting or keeping a textbook, using a new classroom technology, or giving more of one type of assignment over another. Students can use this information to decide which course materials lead to higher exam performance and find optimal ways to study. In fact, survey results gathered from students enrolled in a previous course find our system useful and logically sound, while students currently enrolled in the same course believe this information to be a useful predictor for exam success. This work falls under the emerging field of educational data mining, as it serves to provide new information to educators and students by examining learning environments, teaching methods, and student factors to formulate insights into the overall curriculum. Our platform is web-based and can thus be accessed and used remotely by instructors worldwide. The goal is to provide instructors with an easy to administer and easy to understand evaluation system which can be deployed anywhere at any time.

This classification system classifies sentences written by L2 learners into either native speaker-like sentences or non-native speaker-like sentences. This classification system was constructed by machine learning algorithms using the word-alignment distributions as classification features for detecting word-byword translated expressions. The training data for machine learning was machine translation sentences as alternative data for L2 learner sentences. The experimental results showed that our classification system provided adequate classification results with respect to (i) the high classification accuracy, (ii) the classification results reflecting the property of L2 learner sentences, and (iii) the higher classification accuracy than classification systems using different classification features from ours. These results show that our classification system can assist evaluation of L2 writing.

Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the best first and genetic algorithm search strategies by removing much more redundant features and still keeping the classification accuracies or even getting better performances.

J	Bui, E; Henderson, B; Viergever, K				Bui, Elisabeth; Henderson, Brent; Viergever, Karin			Using knowledge discovery with data mining from the Australian Soil Resource Information System database to inform soil carbon mapping in Australia	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES			English	Article							ORGANIC-CARBON; GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; GREAT-BRITAIN; UNITED-STATES; DECOMPOSITION; VEGETATION; LITTER; STOCKS; MODEL; QUEENSLAND	We present a piecewise linear decision tree model for predicting percent of soil organic C (SOC) in the agricultural zones of Australia generated using a machine learning approach. The inputs for the model are a national database of soil data, national digital surfaces of climate, elevation, and terrain variables, Landsat multispectral scanner data, lithology, land use, and soil maps. The model and resulting map are evaluated, and insights into biogeological surficial processes are discussed. The decision tree splits the overall data set into more homogenous subsets, thus in this case, it identifies areas where SOC responds closely to climatic and other environmental variables. The spatial pattern of SOC corresponds well to maps of estimated primary productivity and bioclimatic zones. Topsoil organic C levels are highest in the high rainfall, temperate regions of Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia, along the coast of New South Wales and in the wet tropics of Queensland; and lowest in arid and semiarid inland regions. While this pattern broadly follows continental vegetation, soil moisture, and temperature patterns, it is governed by a spatially variable hierarchy of different climatic and other variables across bioregions of Australia. At the continental scale, soil moisture level, rather than temperature, seems most important in controlling SOC.

The characteristic framework type of a zeolite is conventionally defined by combining information on its coordination sequences, vertex symbols, tiling, and transitivity information. Here we present a novel knowledge-based approach for zeolite framework type classification. We show the predicting abilities of a machine learning model that uses a nine-dimensional feature vector including novel topological descriptors obtained by computational geometry techniques, together with selected physical and chemical properties of zeolite crystals. Trained oil the crystallographic structures of known zeolites, this model predicts the framework types of zeolite crystals with very high accuracy.

J	Huang, J; Salim, A; Lei, KB; O'Sullivan, K; Pawitan, Y				Huang, Jian; Salim, Agus; Lei, Kaibin; O'Sullivan, Kathleen; Pawitan, Yudi			Classification of array CGH data using smoothed logistic regression model	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						high-throughput data; genomics; cancer; machine learning; cross-validation	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; DNA COPY NUMBER; MICROARRAY DATA; SEGMENTATION	Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a genome-wide information of DNA copy number that is potentially useful for disease classification. One immediate problem is that the data contain many features (probes) but only a few samples. Existing approaches to overcome this problem include features selection, ridge regression and partial least squares. However, these methods typically ignore the spatial characteristic of aCGH data. To explicitly make use of this spatial information we develop a procedure called smoothed logistic regression (SLR) model. The procedure is based on a mixed logistic regression model, where the random component is a mixture distribution that controls smoothness and sparseness. Conceptually such a procedure is straightforward, but its implementation is complicated due to computational problems. We develop a fast and reliable iterative weighted least-squares algorithm based on the singular value decomposition. Simulated data and two real data sets are used to illustrate the procedure. For real data sets, error rates are calculated using the leave-one-out cross validation procedure. For both simulated and real data examples, SLR achieves better misclassification error rates compared with previous methods. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

One hundred species of Lepidoptera, selected from the Distribution Atlas of European Butterflies, and three climate variables were used to determine the bioclimatic envelope for each butterfly species. The data set consisting of 2620 grid squares 30' x 60' in size all over Europe was randomly split into the calibration and the evaluation data sets. The performance of different models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot. Observed differences in modelling accuracy among species were then related to the geographical attributes of the species using GAM. The modelling performance was negatively related to the latitudinal range and prevalence, whereas the effect of spatial autocorrelation on prediction accuracy depended on the modelling technique. These three geographical attributes accounted for 19-61% of the variation in the modelling accuracy. Predictive accuracy of GAM, GLM and MDA was highly influenced by the three geographical attributes, whereas RF, ANN and GBM were moderately, and MARS and CTA only slightly affected. The contrasting effects of geographical distribution of species on predictive performance of different modelling techniques represent one source of uncertainty in species spatial distribution models. This should be taken into account in biogeographical modelling studies and assessments of climate change impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Palombo, G; Narsky, I				Palombo, G.; Narsky, I.			A numeric comparison of variable selection algorithms for supervised learning	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						StatPatternRecognition; Machine learning; Data analysis; Variable selection; Classification	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; RELEVANCE	Datasets in modern High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments are often described by dozens or even hundreds of input variables. Reducing a full variable set to a Subset that most completely represents information about data is therefore an important task in analysis of HEP data. We compare various variable selection algorithms for supervised learning using several datasets such as, for instance, imaging gamma-ray Cherenkov telescope (MAGIC) data found at the UCl repository. We use classifiers and variable selection methods implemented in the statistical package StatPatternRecognition (SPR), a free open-source C++ package developed in the HEP community (http://sourceforge.net/projects/statpatrec/). For each dataset, we select a powerful classifier and estimate its learning accuracy on variable subsets obtained by various selection algorithms. When possible, we also estimate the CPU time needed for the variable subset selection. The results of this analysis are compared with those published previously for these datasets using other statistical packages such as R and Weka.

J	Deng, L; Guan, JH; Dong, QW; Zhou, SG				Deng, Lei; Guan, Jihong; Dong, Qiwen; Zhou, Shuigeng			Prediction of protein-protein interaction sites using an ensemble method	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							INFLUENZA-A VIRUS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NS1 PROTEIN; RECOGNITION SITES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SEQUENCE PROFILE; BINDING DOMAIN; NUCLEAR EXPORT; INTERFACES; DATABASE	Background: Prediction of protein-protein interaction sites is one of the most challenging and intriguing problems in the field of computational biology. Although much progress has been achieved by using various machine learning methods and a variety of available features, the problem is still far from being solved. Results: In this paper, an ensemble method is proposed, which combines bootstrap resampling technique, SVM-based fusion classifiers and weighted voting strategy, to overcome the imbalanced problem and effectively utilize a wide variety of features. We evaluate the ensemble classifier using a dataset extracted from 99 polypeptide chains with 10-fold cross validation, and get a AUC score of 0.86, with a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.78, which are better than that of the existing methods. To improve the usefulness of the proposed method, two special ensemble classifiers are designed to handle the cases of missing homologues and structural information respectively, and the performance is still encouraging. The robustness of the ensemble method is also evaluated by effectively classifying interaction sites from surface residues as well as from all residues in proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to identify interaction sites from the non-structural proteins (NS) of the influenza A virus, which may be utilized as potential drug target sites. Conclusion: Our experimental results show that the ensemble classifiers are quite effective in predicting protein interaction sites. The Sub-EnClassifiers with resampling technique can alleviate the imbalanced problem and the combination of Sub-EnClassifiers with a wide variety of feature groups can significantly improve prediction performance.

Recently, machine learning algorithms were developed to predict potential miRNA targets. Most of these methods are robust but are not sensitive to redundant or irrelevant features. Despite their good performance, the relative importance of each feature is still unclear. With increasing experimental data becoming available, research interest has shifted from higher prediction performance to uncovering the mechanism of microRNA-mRNA interactions. Results: Systematic analysis of sequence, structural and positional features was carried out for two different data sets. The dominant functional features were distinguished from uninformative features in single and hybrid feature sets. Models were developed using only statistically significant sequence, structural and positional features, resulting in area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) values of 0.919, 0.927 and 0.969 for one data set and of 0.926, 0.874 and 0.954 for another data set, respectively. Hybrid models were developed by combining various features and achieved AUC of 0.978 and 0.970 for two different data sets. Functional miRNA information is well reflected in these features, which are expected to be valuable in understanding the mechanism of microRNA-mRNA interactions and in designing experiments. Conclusions: Differing from previous approaches, this study focused on systematic analysis of all types of features. Statistically significant features were identified and used to construct models that yield similar accuracy to previous studies in a shorter computation time.

J	Menahem, E; Rokach, L; Elovici, Y				Menahem, Eitan; Rokach, Lior; Elovici, Yuval			Troika - An improved stacking schema for classification tasks	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Machine learning; Meta combination; Ensemble of classifiers; Stacked generalization	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLE; DECOMPOSITION; CLASSIFIERS	Stacking is a general ensemble method in which a number of base classifiers are combined using one meta-classifier which learns their outputs. Such an approach provides certain advantages: simplicity; performance that is similar to the best classifier; and the capability of combining classifiers induced by different inducers. The disadvantage of stacking is that on multiclass problems, stacking seems to perform worse than other meta-learning approaches. in this paper we present Troika, a new stacking method for improving ensemble classifiers. The new scheme is built from three layers of combining classifiers. The new method was tested on various datasets and the results indicate the superiority of the proposed method to other legacy ensemble schemes, Stacking and StackingC, especially when the classification task consists of more than two classes.

J	Scherer, R				Scherer, Rafal			Neuro-fuzzy relational systems for nonlinear approximation and prediction	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; Neuro-fuzzy systems; Machine learning		There are many machine learning systems developed so far. Fuzzy systems along with neural network are the most commonly used learning systems. Researchers mainly use Mamdani (linguistic) and Takagi Sugeno fuzzy systems, and in the paper, relational neuro-fuzzy systems are proposed for better flexibility. Linguistic systems store an input-output mapping in the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules with linguistic terms both in antecedents and consequents. Relational fuzzy systems bond input and output fuzzy linguistic values by a binary relation thus fuzzy rules have additional weights. Thanks to this the system is better adjustable to learning data. Described systems are tested on several known benchmarks and compared with other machine learning solutions from the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experimental characterization of transporters is costly and time-consuming. Current computational methods for transporter characterization still require extensive curation efforts, especially for eukaryotic organisms. We developed a novel genome-scale transporter prediction and characterization system called TransportTP that combined homology-based and machine learning methods in a two-phase classification approach. First, traditional homology methods were employed to predict novel transporters based on sequence similarity to known classified proteins in the Transporter Classification Database ( TCDB). Second, machine learning methods were used to integrate a variety of features to refine the initial predictions. A set of rules based on transporter features was developed by machine learning using well-curated proteomes as guides. Results: In a cross-validation using the yeast proteome for training and the proteomes of ten other organisms for testing, TransportTP achieved an equivalent recall and precision of 81.8%, based on TransportDB, a manually annotated transporter database. In an independent test using the Arabidopsis proteome for training and four recently sequenced plant proteomes for testing, it achieved a recall of 74.6% and a precision of 73.4%, according to our manual curation. Conclusions: TransportTP is the most effective tool for eukaryotic transporter characterization up to date.

J	Yan, RX; Si, JN; Wang, C; Zhang, ZD				Yan, Ren-Xiang; Si, Jing-Na; Wang, Chuan; Zhang, Ziding			DescFold: A web server for protein fold recognition	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PREDICTED SECONDARY STRUCTURE; REMOTE HOMOLOGY DETECTION; STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT; SEQUENCE PROFILES; STRUCTURE INFORMATION; TWILIGHT ZONE; PSI-BLAST; DATABASE; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Background: Machine learning-based methods have been proven to be powerful in developing new fold recognition tools. In our previous work [Zhang, Kochhar and Grigorov ( 2005) Protein Science, 14: 431-444], a machine learning-based method called DescFold was established by using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to combine the following four descriptors: a profile-sequence-alignment-based descriptor using Psi-blast e-values and bit scores, a sequence-profile-alignment-based descriptor using Rps-blast e-values and bit scores, a descriptor based on secondary structure element alignment (SSEA), and a descriptor based on the occurrence of PROSITE functional motifs. In this work, we focus on the improvement of DescFold by incorporating more powerful descriptors and setting up a user-friendly web server. Results: In seeking more powerful descriptors, the profile-profile alignment score generated from the COMPASS algorithm was first considered as a new descriptor (i.e., PPA). When considering a profile-profile alignment between two proteins in the context of fold recognition, one protein is regarded as a template (i.e., its 3D structure is known). Instead of a sequence profile derived from a Psi-blast search, a structure-seeded profile for the template protein was generated by searching its structural neighbors with the assistance of the TM-align structural alignment algorithm. Moreover, the COMPASS algorithm was used again to derive a profile-structural-profile-alignment-based descriptor (i.e., PSPA). We trained and tested the new DescFold in a total of 1,835 highly diverse proteins extracted from the SCOP 1.73 version. When the PPA and PSPA descriptors were introduced, the new DescFold boosts the performance of fold recognition substantially. Using the SCOP_1.73_40% dataset as the fold library, the DescFold web server based on the trained SVM models was further constructed. To provide a large-scale test for the new DescFold, a stringent test set of 1,866 proteins were selected from the SCOP 1.75 version. At a less than 5% false positive rate control, the new DescFold is able to correctly recognize structural homologs at the fold level for nearly 46% test proteins. Additionally, we also benchmarked the DescFold method against several well-established fold recognition algorithms through the LiveBench targets and Lindahl dataset. Conclusions: The new DescFold method was intensively benchmarked to have very competitive performance compared with some well-established fold recognition methods, suggesting that it can serve as a useful tool to assist in template-based protein structure prediction. The DescFold server is freely accessible at http://202.112.170.199/DescFold/index.html.

J	Liu, TY; Altman, RB				Liu, Tianyun; Altman, Russ B.			Prediction of calcium-binding sites by combining loop-modeling with machine learning	BMC STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CONCANAVALIN-A; PROTEINS; DOMAIN; IDENTIFICATION; SPECIFICITY; AFFINITY; DESIGN	Background: Protein ligand-binding sites in the apo state exhibit structural flexibility. This flexibility often frustrates methods for structure-based recognition of these sites because it leads to the absence of electron density for these critical regions, particularly when they are in surface loops. Methods for recognizing functional sites in these missing loops would be useful for recovering additional functional information. Results: We report a hybrid approach for recognizing calcium-binding sites in disordered regions. Our approach combines loop modeling with a machine learning method (FEATURE) for structure-based site recognition. For validation, we compared the performance of our method on known calcium-binding sites for which there are both holo and apo structures. When loops in the apo structures are rebuilt using modeling methods, FEATURE identifies 14 out of 20 crystallographically proven calcium-binding sites. It only recognizes 7 out of 20 calcium-binding sites in the initial apo crystal structures. We applied our method to unstructured loops in proteins from SCOP families known to bind calcium in order to discover potential cryptic calcium binding sites. We built 2745 missing loops and evaluated them for potential calcium binding. We made 102 predictions of calcium-binding sites. Ten predictions are consistent with independent experimental verifications. We found indirect experimental evidence for 14 other predictions. The remaining 78 predictions are novel predictions, some with intriguing potential biological significance. In particular, we see an enrichment of beta-sheet folds with predicted calcium binding sites in the connecting loops on the surface that may be important for calcium-mediated function switches. Conclusion: Protein crystal structures are a potentially rich source of functional information. When loops are missing in these structures, we may be losing important information about binding sites and active sites. We have shown that limited loop modeling (e. g. loops less than 17 residues) combined with pattern matching algorithms can recover functions and propose putative conformations associated with these functions.

Here, we constructed a 'neural art appraiser' based on machine-learning methods that predicted the painter from the functional MRI activity pattern elicited by a painting. We found that Dali's and Picasso's artworks could be accurately classified based on brain activity alone, and that broadly distributed brain activity contributed to the neural prediction. Our approach provides a new means to probe into complex neural processes underlying art experiences.

We will examine the motivation for such systems and then examine the majority of the systems developed over the last 25 years. To highlight some of the possible future directions for new research, the review uses primary terms of reference based on four elements: testing status, expressive representation, polyphonic ability, and performance creativity.

Given a few examples of a particular type of motion as input, we learn a generative model that is able to synthesize a family of spatial and temporal variants that are statistically similar to the input examples. The new variants retain the features of the original examples, but are not exact copies of them. We learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network model from the input examples that enables us to capture properties of conditional independence in the data, and model it using a multivariate probability distribution. We present results for a variety of human motion, and 2D handwritten characters. We perform a user study to show that our new variants are less repetitive than typical game and crowd simulation approaches of re-playing a small number of existing motion clips. Our technique can synthesize new variants efficiently and has a small memory requirement.

Every clustering algorithm is composed of several solutions for specific sub-problems in the clustering process. These solutions are linked together in a clustering algorithm, and they define the process and the structure of the algorithm. Frequently, many of these solutions occur in more than one clustering algorithm. Mostly, new clustering algorithms include frequently occurring solutions to typical sub-problems from clustering, as well as from other machine-learning algorithms. The problem is that these solutions are usually integrated in their algorithms, and that original algorithms are not designed to share solutions to sub-problems outside the original algorithm easily. We propose a way of designing cluster algorithms and to improve existing ones, based on reusable components. Reusable components are well-documented, frequently occurring solutions to specific sub-problems in a specific area. Thus we identify reusable components, first, as solutions to characteristic sub-problems in partitioning cluster algorithms, and, further, identify a generic structure for the design of partitioning cluster algorithms. We analyze some partitioning algorithms (K-means, X-means, MPCK-means, and Kohonen SOM), and identify reusable components in them. We give examples of how new cluster algorithms can be designed based on them.

J	Kauffman, C; Karypis, G				Kauffman, Chris; Karypis, George			LIBRUS: combined machine learning and homology information for sequence-based ligand-binding residue prediction	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SECONDARY STRUCTURE; PROTEIN; LEAD; GENERATION; PROFILES	Motivation: Identifying residues that interact with ligands is useful as a first step to understanding protein function and as an aid to designing small molecules that target the protein for interaction. Several studies have shown that sequence features are very informative for this type of prediction, while structure features have also been useful when structure is available. We develop a sequence-based method, called LIBRUS, that combines homology-based transfer and direct prediction using machine learning and compare it to previous sequence-based work and current structure-based methods. Results: Our analysis shows that homology-based transfer is slightly more discriminating than a support vector machine learner using profiles and predicted secondary structure. We combine these two approaches in a method called LIBRUS. On a benchmark of 885 sequence-independent proteins, it achieves an area under the ROC curve (ROC) of 0.83 with 45% precision at 50% recall, a significant improvement over previous sequence-based efforts. On an independent benchmark set, a current method, FINDSITE, based on structure features achieves an ROC of 0.81 with 54% precision at 50% recall, while LIBRUS achieves an ROC of 0.82 with 39% precision at 50% recall at a smaller computational cost. When LIBRUS and FINDSITE predictions are combined, performance is increased beyond either reaching an ROC of 0.86 and 59% precision at 50% recall.

Elucidating a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Neuroanatomic Biomarker for Psychosis: Classification Analysis Using Probabilistic Brain Atlas and Machine Learning Algorithms	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Classification; cortical pattern matching; MRI; psychosis; PyMVPA; schizophrenia	DIMENSIONAL PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; HEALTHY CONTROLS; MR-IMAGES; DSM-IV; REGISTRATION; INTERVIEW; PRODROME; CORTEX	Background: No objective diagnostic biomarkers or laboratory tests have yet been developed for psychotic illness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies consistently find significant abnormalities in multiple brain structures in psychotic patients relative to healthy control subjects, but these abnormalities show substantial overlap with anatomic variation that is in the normal range and therefore nondiagnostic. Recently, efforts have been made to discriminate psychotic patients from healthy individuals using machine-learning-based pattern classification methods on MRI data. Methods: Three-dimensional cortical gray matter density (GMD) maps were generated for 36 patients with recent-onset psychosis and 36 sex- and age-matched control subjects using a cortical pattern matching method. Between-group differences in GMD were evaluated. Second, the sparse multinomial logistic regression classifier included in the Multivariate Pattern Analysis in Python machine-learning package was applied to the cortical GMD maps to discriminate psychotic patients from control subjects. Results: Patients showed significantly lower GMD, particularly in prefrontal, cingulate, and lateral temporal brain regions. Pattern classification analysis achieved 86.1% accuracy in discriminating patients from controls using leave-one-out cross-validation. Conclusions: These results suggest that even at the early stage of illness, psychotic patients present distinct patterns of regional cortical gray matter changes that can be discriminated from the normal pattern. These findings indicate that we can detect complex patterns of brain abnormality in early stages of psychotic illness, which has critical implications for early identification and intervention in individuals at ultra-high risk for developing psychosis/schizophrenia.

Averages are computed via the notion of Frechet mean, and the associated metric dispersion is interpreted as the variance of the patterns around the Frechet mean. Also, the problem of continuous interpolation of two SPD patterns is tackled within the manuscript. The property of volume conservation of the Frechet mean and of the considered interpolatory scheme for SPD matrices is discussed as well. The paper describes several applications where the technique could be readily exploited, including in machine learning, intelligent control, pattern classification, speech emotion classification and diffusion tensor data analysis in medicine.

J	Bulashevska, A; Stein, M; Jackson, D; Eils, R				Bulashevska, Alla; Stein, Martin; Jackson, David; Eils, Roland			Prediction of small molecule binding property of protein domains with Bayesian classifiers based on Markov chains	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Function prediction; Proteomics; Small molecule binding domains; Drug discovery; Bayesian classifiers; Markov chains	MODELS; PFAM	Accurate computational methods that can help to predict biological function of a protein from its sequence are of great interest to research biologists and pharmaceutical companies. One approach to assume the function of proteins is to predict the interactions between proteins and other molecules. In this work, we propose a machine learning method that uses a primary sequence of a domain to predict its propensity for interaction with small molecules. By curating the Pfam database with respect to the small molecule binding ability of its component domains, we have constructed a dataset of small molecule binding and non-binding domains. This dataset was then used as training set to learn a Bayesian classifier, which should distinguish members of each class. The domain sequences of both classes are modelled with Markov chains. In a Jack-knife test, our classification procedure achieved the predictive accuracies of 77.2% and 66.7% for binding and non-binding classes respectively. We demonstrate the applicability of our classifier by using it to identify previously unknown small molecule binding domains. Our predictions are available as supplementary material and can provide very Useful information to drug discovery specialists. Given the ubiquitous and essential role small molecules play in biological processes, Our method is important for identifying pharmaceutically relevant components of complete proteomes.

ROOT - A C++ framework for petabyte data storage, statistical analysis and visualization	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						C plus; Object-oriented; Framework; Interpreter; Data storage; Data analysis; Visualization		ROOT is an object-oriented C++ framework conceived in the high-energy physics (HEP) community. designed for storing and analyzing petabytes of data in an efficient way. Any instance of a C++ class can be stored into a ROOT file in a machine-independent compressed binary format. In ROOT the 17ree object container is optimized for statistical data analysis over very large data sets by using vertical data storage techniques. These containers can span a large number of files on local disks, the web, or a number of different shared file systems. In order to analyze this data, the user can chose out of a wide set of mathematical and statistical functions, inClUding linear algebra classes, numerical algorithms such as integration and minimization, and various methods for performing regression analysis (fitting). In particular. the RooFit package allows the user to perform complex data modeling and fitting while the RooStats library provides abstractions and implementations for advanced statistical tools. Multivariate classification methods based on machine learning techniques are available via the TMVA package. A central piece in these analysis tools are the histogram classes which provide binning of one- and multi-dimensional data. Results can be saved in high-quality graphical formats like Postscript and PDF or in bitmap formats like JPG or GIF. The result can also be stored into ROOT macros that allow a full recreation and rework of the graphics. Users typically create their analysis macros step by step, making use of the interactive C++ interpreter CINT, while running over small data samples. Once the development is finished, they can run these macros at full compiled speed over large data sets. using onthe-fly compilation, or by creating a stand-alone batch program. Finally, if processing farms are available, the user can reduce the execution time of intrinsically parallel tasks - e.g. data mining in HEP - by using PROOF, which will take care of optimally distributing the work over the available resources in a transparent way.

J	Scherberger, H				Scherberger, Hansjoerg			Neural control of motor prostheses	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MACHINE INTERFACES; CORTICAL-NEURONS; MOVEMENT SIGNAL; RESTORATION; HAND; DEVICES; EEG; COMMUNICATION; TETRAPLEGIA	Neural interfaces (NIs) for motor control have recently become increasingly advanced. This has been possible owing to substantial progress in our understanding of the cortical motor system as well as the development of appropriate decoding methods in both non-human primates and paralyzed patients. So far, neural interfaces have controlled mainly computer screens and robotic arms. An important advancement has been the demonstration of neural interfaces that can directly control the subject's muscles. Furthermore, it has been shown that cortical plasticity alone can optimize neural interface performance in the absence of machine learning, which emphasizes the role of the brain for neural interface adaptation. Future motor prostheses may use also sensory feedback to enhance their control capabilities.

The graph parameters called Topological Indices (TIs) are useful to link the molecular structure with physicochemical and biological properties. However, there have been recent efforts to extend these methods to the study of proteins and whole proteomes as well. In this case, we are in the presence of Quantitative Protein/Proteome- Property Relationship (QPPR) models, by analogy to QSPR. In the present work we review, discuss, and outline some perspectives on the use of these QPPR techniques applied to single proteins of Parasitic Organisms, Plants and Human Guests. We make emphasis on the different types of graphs and network representations of proteins, the structural information codified by different protein TIs, the statistical or machine learning techniques used and the biological properties predicted. This article also provides a reference to the various legal avenues that are available for the protection of software used in proteins QSAR; as well as the acceptance and legal treatment of scientific results and techniques derived from such software. We also make reference to the recent implementation by Munteanu and Gonzalez-Daz of the internet portal called BioAims freely available for the use of the international research community. This portal includes the web-server packages TargetPred with two new Protein-QSAR servers: ATCUNPred (http://miaja.tic.udc.es/Bio-AIMS/ATCUNPred.php) for prediction of ATCUN-mediated DNA-clevage anticancer proteins and EnzClassPred for prediction of enzyme classes (http://miaja.tic.udc.es/BioAIMS/EnzClassPred.php). Last we included an overview of relevant topics related to legal protection, regulation, and international tax issues involved in practical use of this type of models and software in proteomics.

MS-QPDR development and practical use is an emerging area combining Proteomics and Bioinformatics; which involves computational, molecular, and legal sciences. We detect, at least two tendencies on QPDR development. The first tendency ( type 1) uses Statistical, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and/or Non-Linear Signal processing to fish for single MS biomarker signals directly within MS data. A recent alternative ( type 2) uses Graph Theory to construct Complex Network representations of MS data. Next, we can calculate graph parameters called Mass-Spectra Topological Indices (MS-TIs) useful to describe the graph. The last step is similar to the first tendency but it uses MS-TIs as inputs ( instead of MS signals) to seek the MS-QPDR model. There are many examples of QPDR models based on scheme 1. However, there has been little effort to seek QPDR models with scheme 2. On the other hand, MS-QPDR models can be obtained from different body fluids; the case of Human Blood Proteome ( BP) is one of the most interesting. The outcomes obtained by Mass Spectrometry ( MS) analysis of Serum Protein Profile (SPP) of Blood Proteome ( BP) are very useful for the early detection of diseases and drug induced toxicities. In the present work we review, discuss, and outline some perspectives on the use of QPDR models based on the two types of schemes. We also refer to the recent implementation of the internet portal called BioAims for QPDR analysis (http://miaja.tic.udc.es/Bio-AIMS/) for free use by the research community.

J	Ivanciuc, O				Ivanciuc, Ovidiu			Machine Learning Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) for Peptides Binding to the Human Amphiphysin-1 SH3 Domain	CURRENT PROTEOMICS			English	Review						Computer-assisted drug design; machine learning; quantitative structure-activity relationships; QSAR; peptide-protein binding affinity; support vector machines; decision tree; human amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain	ALIGNMENT-FREE PREDICTION; T-CELL EPITOPES; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; TOPOLOGICAL INDEXES; COMPLEX NETWORK; MOLECULE HLA-A-ASTERISK-0201; PROTEIN-SEQUENCE; SPIRAL NETWORKS; HUMAN BREAST; AMINO-ACIDS	Developing machine learning methods to predict peptide-protein binding affinity has become an important approach in proteomics. A diversity of linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms is applied in quantitative structure-activity relationships ( QSAR) to generate predictive models for ligand binding to a biological receptor. QSAR represent regression models that define quantitative correlations between the chemical structure of molecules and their physical, chemical, or biological properties. A QSAR equation predicts a molecular property from a set of molecular descriptors representing the input data to a machine learning algorithm, such as linear regression, partial least squares, artificial neural networks, or support vector machines. Here we present a QSAR comparative study for peptides binding to the human amphiphysin-1 SH3 domain, based on five machine learning methods, namely partial least squares, radial basis function artificial neural networks, support vector machines, Gaussian processes, k-nearest neighbors, and the decision trees REPTree and M5P, as implemented in the machine learning software Weka. The peptide structure was encoded with five amino acid scales, namely the Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) substitution matrix, G. Schneider's principal component (GSPC) scale, Lv's DPPS scale, Clementi's GRID scale, and Wold's z scale. The machine learning models were trained with a dataset of 200 peptides, and the QSAR models were tested for a prediction dataset of 684 peptides. The best predictions were obtained with the decision tree M5P for all five amino acid scales, namely z scale q(2) = 0.543, MJ scale q(2) = 0.553, GSPC scale q(2) = 0.557, GRID scale q(2) = 0.558, and DPPS scale q(2) = 0.599. These results show that M5P decision trees give predictive QSAR for peptide-protein binding affinity, and should be considered as valuable candidates for other peptide QSAR. Also, the new DPPS scale has clear advantages compared to the previous amino acid descriptors. The study provides support to QSAR approaches based on a large-scale evaluation of machine learning algorithms and diverse classes of structural descriptors.

Two of the methods use rotation variant texture features and the other two use rotation invariant features. This paper also proposes a novel approach to estimate 3D orientations of tissues based on rotation variant DT-CWT features. The method updates the strongest structural anisotropy direction with an iterative approach and converges to a volume orientation in few steps. Although classification and segmentation results show that there is no significant difference in the performance between rotation variant and invariant features; the latter are more robust to changes in texture rotation, which is essential for classification and segmentation of objects from 3D datasets such as medical tomography images.

Histogram distance-based Bayesian Network structure learning: A supervised classification specific approach	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian Network; Histogram distance; Supervised classification; Machine learning; Structure learning	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS; IMAGE; DATABASES; INFERENCE; SPACE	In this work we introduce a methodology based on histogram distances for the automatic induction of Bayesian Networks (BN) from a file containing cases and variables related to a supervised classification problem. The main idea consists of learning the Bayesian Network structure for classification purposes taking into account the classification itself, by comparing the class distribution histogram distances obtained by the Bayesian Network after classifying each case. The structure is learned by applying eight different measures or metrics: the Cooper and Herskovits metric for a general Bayesian Network and seven different statistical distances between pairs of histograms. The results obtained confirm the hypothesis of the authors about the convenience of having a BN structure learning method which takes into account the existence of the special variable (the one corresponding to the class) in supervised classification problems.

J	Patel, AK; Patel, S; Naik, PK				Patel, Amiya Kumar; Patel, Seema; Naik, Pradeep Kumar			BINARY CLASSIFICATION OF UNCHARACTERIZED PROTEINS INTO DNA BINDING/NON-DNA BINDING PROTEINS FROM SEQUENCE DERIVED FEATURES USING ANN	DIGEST JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS AND BIOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						DNA binding proteins; binary classification; sequence derived features; Artificial neural network	SVM-BASED METHOD; PSI-BLAST; RECOGNITION; PREDICTION; BIOLOGY	The problem for predicting DNA binding and non-DNA binding proteins from protein sequence information is still an open problem in bioinformatics. It is further becoming more important as the number of sequenced information grows exponentially over time. Sequence similarity matrices are a useful approach to provide functional annotation, but its use is sometime limited, prompting the development and use of machine learning methods. We implemented a novel approach for predicting the DNA binding and non-DNA binding proteins from its amino acid sequence using artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN used in this study is a feed-forward neural network with a standard back propagation training algorithm. Using 62 sequence features alone, we have been able to achieve 72.99% correct prediction of proteins into DNA binding/non-DNA binding (in the set of 1000 proteins). For the complete set of 62 parameters using 5 fold cross-validated classification, ANN model revealed a superior model (accuracy = 72.99%, Q(pred) = 73.952%, sensitivity = 81.53% and specificity = 72.54%).

Many resources have catalogued molecular alterations in known PID genes along with their associated clinical and immunological phenotypes. However, these resources do not assist in identifying candidate PID genes. We have recently developed a platform designated Resource of Asian PDIs, which hosts information pertaining to molecular alterations, protein-protein interaction networks, mouse studies and microarray gene expression profiling of all known PID genes. Using this resource as a discovery tool, we describe the development of an algorithm for prediction of candidate PID genes. Using a support vector machine learning approach, we have predicted 1442 candidate PID genes using 69 binary features of 148 known PID genes and 3162 non-PID genes as a training data set. The power of this approach is illustrated by the fact that six of the predicted genes have recently been experimentally confirmed to be PID genes. The remaining genes in this predicted data set represent attractive candidates for testing in patients where the etiology cannot be ascribed to any of the known PID genes.

J	Whiteson, S; Whiteson, D				Whiteson, Shimon; Whiteson, Daniel			Machine learning for event selection in high energy physics	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; Neural networks; Evolutionary computation; High energy physics; Event selection	TOP-QUARK PRODUCTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PARTICLE; BOSONS	The field of high energy physics aims to discover the underlying structure of matter by searching for and studying exotic particles, such as the top quark and Higgs boson, produced in collisions at modern accelerators. Since such accelerators are extraordinarily expensive, extracting maximal information from the resulting data is essential. However, most accelerator events do not produce particles of interest, so making effective measurements requires event selection, in which events producing particles of interest (signal) are separated from events producing other particles (background). This article studies the use of machine learning to aid event selection. First, we apply supervised learning methods, which have succeeded previously in similar tasks. However, they are suboptimal in this case because they assume that the selector with the highest classification accuracy will yield the best final analysis: this is not true in practice, as such analyses are more sensitive to some backgrounds than others. Second, we present a new approach that uses stochastic optimization techniques to directly search for selectors that maximize either the precision of top quark mass measurements or the sensitivity to the presence of the Higgs boson. Empirical results confirm that stochastically optimized selectors result in substantially better analyses. We also describe a case study in which the best selector is applied to real data from the Fermilab Tevatron accelerator, resulting in the most precise top quark mass measurement of this type to date. Hence, this new approach to event selection has already contributed to our knowledge of the top quark's mass and our understanding of the larger questions upon which it sheds light.

The data set was divided into 57 molecules of training and 14 molecules of test sets. A large number of descriptors were calculated and genetic algorithm (GA) was used to select variables that resulted in the best-fitted for models. A comparison between the obtained results using SVM with those of multi-parameter linear regression (MLR) revealed that SVM model was much better than MLR model. The improvements are due to the fact that the activity of the compounds demonstrates non-linear correlations with the selected descriptors. Also distances between Oxygen and Chlorine atoms, the mass, the van der Waals volume, the electronegativity, and the polarizability, of the molecules are the main independent factors contributing to the BK-channels activity of the studied compounds.

Intrusion detection is one major research problem in network security, whose aim is to identify unusual access or attacks to secure internal networks. In literature, intrusion detection systems have been approached by various machine learning techniques. However, there is no a review paper to examine and understand the current status of using machine learning techniques to solve the intrusion detection problems. This chapter reviews 55 related studies in the period between 2000 and 2007 focusing on developing single, hybrid, and ensemble classifiers. Related studies are compared by their classifier design, datasets used, and other experimental setups. Current achievements and limitations in developing intrusion detection systems by machine learning are present and discussed. A number of future research directions are also provided.

We identify methods of increasing complexity and data preparation cost yielding increasing improvements in forecasting accuracy, by varying the forecasting technique, the input features and model scope on an extensive SKU-store level sales and promotion time series from a European grocery retailer. At the high end of data and technique complexity, we propose using regression trees with explicit features constructed from sales and promotion time series of the focal and related SKU-store combinations. We observe that data pooling almost always improves model performance. The results indicate that simple time series techniques perform very well for periods without promotions. However, for periods with promotions, regression trees with explicit features improve accuracy substantially. More sophisticated input is only beneficial when advanced techniques are used. We believe that our approach and findings shed light into certain questions that arise while building a grocery sales forecasting system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hou, SM; Li, YR				Hou, Shumin; Li, Yourong			Short-term fault prediction based on support vector machines with parameter optimization by evolution strategy	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Support vector machines; Evolutionary algorithms; Fault prediction		Support vector machines (SVMs) are the effective machine-learning methods based on the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle, which is an approach to minimize the upper bound risk functional related to the generalization performance. The parameter selection is an important factor that impacts the performance of SVMs. Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) is an evolutionary optimization strategy, which is used to optimize the parameters of SVMs in this paper. Compared with the traditional SVMs, the optimal SVMs using CMA-ES have more accuracy in predicting the Lorenz signal.

EFFICACY OF AUTOMATIC VOCALIZATION RECOGNITION SOFTWARE FOR ANURAN MONITORING	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						ARS; automated recording system; frog call; machine learning; monitoring program; study design		Surveys of vocalizations are a widely used method for monitoring anurans, but it can be difficult to coordinate standardized data collection across a large geographic area. Digital automated recording systems (ARS) offer a low-cost method for obtaining samples of anuran vocalizations, but the number of recordings can easily overwhelm human listeners. We tested Song Scope, an automatic vocalization recognition software program for personal computers to determine if this type of machine learning approach is currently a viable solution for anuran monitoring. For three species, Song Scope scanned more than 200 h of recordings in 3-20 h at the settings we chose. The software misidentified true calls (false positive) at rates of 2.7%-15.8% per species and failed to detect calls (false negative) in 45%-51% of recordings. There exists a tradeoff between false positive and false negative errors, which can be adjusted by setting the minimum criteria for the recognition software. Users of this approach should carefully consider their reasons for monitoring and how they intend to use the data before creating a large monitoring network.	[Waddle, J.

J	Hullermeier, E; Vanderlooy, S				Huellermeier, Eyke; Vanderlooy, Stijn			Why Fuzzy Decision Trees are Good Rankers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; bipartite ranking; decision trees; fine-granular membership degrees; fuzzy inference; Laplace correction; soft feature splits		Several fuzzy extensions of decision tree induction, which is an established machine-learning method, have already been proposed in the literature. So far, however, fuzzy decision trees have almost exclusively been used for the performance task of classification. In this paper, we show that a fuzzy extension of decision trees is arguably more useful for another performance task, namely ranking. Roughly, the goal of ranking is to order a set of instances from most likely positive to most likely negative. The motivation for applying fuzzy decision trees to this problem originates from recent investigations of the ranking performance of conventional decision trees. These investigations will be continued and complemented in this paper. Our results reveal some properties that seem to be crucial for a good ranking performance-properties that are better and more naturally offered by fuzzy than by conventional decision trees. Most notably, a fuzzy decision tree produces scores in terms of membership degrees on a fine-granular scale. Using these membership degrees as a ranking criterion, a key problem of conventional decision trees is solved in an elegant way, namely the question of how to break ties between instances in the same leaf or, more generally, between equally scored instances.

Local Minimax Learning of Functions With Best Finite Sample Estimation Error Bounds: Applications to Ridge and Lasso Regression, Boosting, Tree Learning, Kernel Machines, and Inverse Problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Fusion; inverse problem; minimax; reproducing kernel; ridge regression	PROJECTION PURSUIT REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; GREEDY APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHMS; CONVERGENCE; PREDICTION	Optimal local estimation is formulated in the minimax sense for inverse problems and nonlinear regression. This theory provides best mean squared finite sample error bounds for some popular statistical learning algorithms and also for several optimal improvements of other existing learning algorithms such as smoothing splines and kernel regularization. The bounds and improved algorithms are not based on asymptotics or Bayesian assumptions and are truly local for each query, not depending on cross validating estimates at other queries to optimize modeling parameters. Results are given for optimal local learning of approximately linear functions with side information (context) using real algebraic geometry. In particular, finite sample error bounds are given for ridge regression and for a local version of lasso regression. The new regression methods require only quadratic programming with linear or quadratic inequality constraints for implementation. Greedy additive expansions are then combined with local minimax learning via a change in metric. An optimal strategy is presented for fusing the local minimax estimators of a class of experts-providing optimal finite sample prediction error bounds from (random) forests. Local minimax learning is extended to kernel machines. Best local prediction error bounds for finite samples are given for Tikhonov regularization. The geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to derive improved estimators with finite sample mean squared error (MSE) bounds for class membership probability in two class pattern classification problems. A purely local, cross validation free algorithm is proposed which uses Fisher information with these bounds to determine best local kernel shape in vector machine learning. Finally, a locally quadratic solution to the finite Fourier moments problem is presented. After reading the first three sections the reader may proceed directly to any of the subsequent applications sections.

In this paper, we contribute a novel approach for learning sequenced spatiotemporal activities in outdoor traffic intersections. Concretely, by representing the activities as sequences of actions, we contribute a semisupervised learning algorithm that learns activities as complete stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), namely, the grammar structure and the parameters.

Indeed, discrete data are an important component in many data mining, machine learning, image processing, and computer vision applications. However, much of the published work on unsupervised feature selection has concentrated on continuous data. We propose a probabilistic approach that assigns relevance weights to discrete features that are considered as random variables modeled by finite discrete mixtures. The choice of finite mixture models is justified by its flexibility which has led to its widespread application in different domains. For the learning of the model, we consider both Bayesian and information-theoretic approaches through stochastic complexity. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the feasibility and merits of our approach on a difficult problem which is clustering and recognizing visual concepts in different image data. The proposed approach is successfully applied also for text clustering.

J	Wang, F; Zhang, CS; Li, T				Wang, Fei; Zhang, Changshui; Li, Tao			Clustering with Local and Global Regularization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Clustering; local learning; smoothness; regularization	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; ILLUMINATION; POSE	Clustering is an old research topic in data mining and machine learning. Most of the traditional clustering methods can be categorized as local or global ones. In this paper, a novel clustering method that can explore both the local and global information in the data set is proposed. The method, Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR), aims to minimize a cost function that properly trades off the local and global costs. We show that such an optimization problem can be solved by the eigenvalue decomposition of a sparse symmetric matrix; which can be done efficiently using iterative methods. Finally, the experimental results on several data sets are presented to show the effectiveness of our method.

However, the effectiveness of a kernel can depend on its sparsity with respect to a specific data set. In fact, the accuracy of a kernel method typically reduces as the kernel sparsity increases. The sparsity problem is particularly common in structured domains involving discrete variables which may take on many different values. In this paper, we explore this issue on two well-known kernels for trees, and propose to face it by recurring to self-organizing maps (SOMs) for structures. Specifically, we show that a suitable combination of the two approaches, obtained by defining a new class of kernels based on the activation map of a SOM for structures, can be effective in avoiding the sparsity problem and results in a system that can be significantly more accurate for categorization tasks on structured data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated experimentally on two relatively large corpora of XML formatted data and a data set of user sessions extracted from website logs.

The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained by rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on the set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization problems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on the set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same global minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its global minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We, therefore, construct an approximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a convex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and concave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows to easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the optimization problem, and therefore, perform labeled weighted graph matching. The algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching methods on four data sets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images, and handwritten Chinese characters. In all cases, the results are competitive with the state of the art.

Therefore, an emerging trend of representing objects by graphs can be observed. This trend is intensified by the development of novel approaches in graph-based machine learning, such as graph kernels or graph-embedding techniques. These procedures overcome a major drawback of graphs, which consists of a serious lack of algorithms for classification. This paper is inspired by the idea of representing graphs through dissimilarities and extends our previous work to the more general setting of Lipschitz embeddings. In an experimental evaluation, we empirically confirm that classifiers that rely on the original graph distances can be outperformed by a classification system using the Lipschitz embedded graphs.

J	Techo, J; Nattee, C; Theeramunkong, T				Techo, Jakkrit; Nattee, Cholwich; Theeramunkong, Thanaruk			A Corpus-Based Approach for Automatic Thai Unknown Word Recognition Using Boosting Techniques	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						unknown word recognition; word boundary detection; data mining; machine learning; ensemble learning	ALGORITHMS	While classification techniques can be applied for automatic unknown word recognition in a language without word boundary, it faces with the problem of unbalanced datasets where the number of positive unknown word candidates is dominantly smaller than that of negative candidates. To solve this problem. this paper presents a corpus-based approach that introduces a so-called group-based ranking evaluation technique into ensemble learning in order to generate a sequence of classification models that later collaborate to select the most probable unknown word from multiple candidates. Given a classification model, the group-based ranking evaluation (GRE) is applied to construct a training dataset for learning the succeeding model, by weighing each of its candidates according to their ranks and correctness when the candidates of an unknown word are considered as one group. A number of experiments have been conducted on a large Thai medical text to evaluate performance of the proposed group-based ranking evaluation approach, namely V-GRE. compared to the conventional naive Bayes classifier and our vanilla version without ensemble learning. As the result, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 90.93 +/- 0.50% when the first rank is selected while it gains 97.26 +/- 0.26% when the top-ten candidates are considered, that is 8.45% and 6.79% improvement over the conventional record-based naive Bayes classifier and the vanilla version. Another result on applying only best features show 93.93 +/- 0.22% and lip to 98.85 +/- 0.15% accuracy for top-1 and top-10, respectively. They are 3.97% and 9.78% improvement over naive Bayes and the vanilla version. Finally. an error analysis is given.

J	Rengifo, HFC; Perdomo, JG				Cadavid Rengifo, Hector Fabio; Gomez Perdomo, Jonatan			Web text corpus extraction system for linguistic tasks	INGENIERIA E INVESTIGACION			Spanish	Article						Web Corpus; crawler; unsupervised language learning; concurrent programming		Internet content, used as text corpus for natural language learning, offers important characteristics for such task, like its huge volume, being permanently up-to-date with linguistic variants and having low time and resource costs regarding the traditional way that text is built for natural language machine learning tasks. This paper describes a system for the automatic extraction of large bodies of text from the Internet as a valuable tool for such learning tasks. A concurrent programming-based, hardware-use optimisation strategy significantly improving extraction performance is also presented. The strategies incorporated into the system for maximising hardware resource exploitation, thereby reducing extraction time are presented, as are extendibility (supporting digital-content formats) and adaptability (regarding how the system cleanses content for obtaining pure natural language samples). The experimental results obtained after processing one of the biggest Spanish domains on the internet, are presented (i.e. es.wikipedio.org). Such results are used for presenting initial conclusions about the validity and applicability of corpus directly extracted from Internet as morphological or syntactical learning input.

J	Wu, J; Li, YZ; Li, ML; Yu, LZ				Wu, Jiang; Li, Yi-Zhou; Li, Meng-Long; Yu, Le-Zheng			Two Multi-classification Strategies Used on SVM to Predict Protein Structural Classes by Using Auto Covariance	INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES-COMPUTATIONAL LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						support vector machine; protein structural class; multi-classification; auto covariance		Machine learning methods play the very important role in protein secondary structure prediction and other related works. On condition of a certain approach, the prediction qualities mostly depend on the ways of representing protein sequences into numeric features. In this paper, two Support Vector Machine (SVM) multi-classification strategies, "one-against-one" (1-a-1) and "one-against-all" (1-a-a), were used in protein structural classes identification. Auto covariance (AC), which transforms the physicochemical properties of the amino acids of the proteins into a data matrix, focuses on the neighboring effects and the interactions between residues in protein sequences. "1-a-1" approach was used on SVM to predict protein structural classes and obtained very promising overall accuracy 90.69% by Jackknife test. It was more than 10% higher than the accuracy obtained by using "1-a-a". Experimental results led to the finding that the SVM predictor constructed by "1-a-1" can avoid the appearance of biased prediction accuracy. This current method, using the protein primary sequence information described by auto covariance (AC) and "1-a-1" approach on SVM, should play an important complementary role in other related applications.

J	Conway, M; Doan, S; Kawazoe, A; Collier, N				Conway, Mike; Doan, Son; Kawazoe, Ai; Collier, Nigel			Classifying disease outbreak reports using n-grams and semantic features	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Text classification; Feature selection; Text mining; Information extraction; Disease tracking		Introduction: This paper explores the benefits of using n-grams and semantic features for the classification of disease outbreak reports, in the context of the BioCaster disease outbreak report text mining system. A novel feature of this work is the use of a general purpose semantic tagger - the USAS tagger - to generate features. Background: We outline the application context for this work (the BioCaster epidemiological text mining system), before going on to describe the experimental data used in our classification experiments (the 1000 document BioCaster corpus). Feature sets: Three broad groups of features are used in this work: Named Entity based features, n-gram features, and features derived from the USAS semantic tagger. Methodology: Three standard machine learning algorithms - Naive Bayes, the Support Vector Machine algorithm, and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm - were used for classifying experimental data (that is, the BioCaster corpus). Feature selection was performed using the chi(2) feature selection algorithm. Standard text classification performance metrics - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity and F-score - are reported. Results: A feature representation composed of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and features derived from a semantic tagger, in conjunction with the Naive Bayes algorithm and feature selection yielded the highest classification accuracy (and F-score). This result was statistically significant compared to a baseline unigram representation and to previous work on the same task. However, it was feature selection rather than semantic tagging that contributed most to the improved performance. Conclusion: This study has shown that for the classification of disease outbreak reports, a combination of bag-of-words, n-grams and semantic features, in conjunction with feature selection, increases classification accuracy at a statistically significant level compared to previous work in this domain.

Annotation and retrieval of clinically relevant images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Medical informatics computing; Information storage and retrieval; Image interpretation; Computer-assisted; Natural language processing	ISSUES	Purpose: Medical images are a significant information source for clinical decision-making. Currently available information retrieval and decision support systems rely primarily on the text of scientific publications to find evidence in support of clinical information needs. The images and illustrations are available only within the full text of a scientific publication and do not directly contribute evidence to such systems. Our first goal is to explore whether image features facilitate finding relevant images that appear in publications. Our second goal is to find promising approaches for providing clinical evidence at the point of service, leveraging information contained in the text and images. Methods: We studied two approaches to finding illustrative evidence: a supervised machine-learning approach, in which images are classified as being relevant to an information need or not, and a pipeline information retrieval approach, in which images were retrieved using associated text and then re-ranked using content-based image retrieval (CBIR) techniques. Results: Our information retrieval approach did not benefit from combining textual and image information. However, given sufficient training data for the machine-learning approach, we achieved 56% average precision at 94% recall using textual features, and 27% average precision at 86% recall using image features. Combining these classifiers resulted in improvement up to 81% precision at 96% recall (74% recall at 85% precision, on average) for the requests with over 180 positive training examples. Conclusions: Our supervised machine-learning methods that combine information from image and text are capable of achieving image annotation and retrieval accuracy acceptable for providing clinical evidence, given sufficient training data.

J	Manine, AP; Alphonse, E; Bessieres, P				Manine, Alain-Pierre; Alphonse, Erick; Bessieres, Philippe			Learning ontological rules to extract multiple relations of genic interactions from text	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Information Extraction; Ontology; Machine Learning; Genic Interactions; Inductive Logic Programming	PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; PARSER; INFORMATION; GRAMMAR	Introduction: Information extraction (IE) systems have been proposed in recent years to extract genic interactions from bibliographical resources. They are limited to single interaction relations, and have to face a trade-off between recall and precision, by focusing either on specific interactions (for precision), or general and unspecified interactions of biological entities (for recall). Yet, biologists need to process more complex data from literature, in order to study biological pathways. An ontology is an adequate formal representation to model this sophisticated knowledge. However, the tight integration of IE systems and ontologies is still a current research issue, a fortiori with complex ones that go beyond hierarchies. Method: We propose a rich modeling of genic interactions with an ontology, and show how it can be used within an IE system. The ontology is seen as a language specifying a normalized representation of text. First, IE is performed by extracting instances from natural language processing (NLP) modules. Then, deductive inferences on the ontology language are completed, and new instances are derived from previously extracted ones. Inference rules are learnt with an inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithm, using the ontology as the hypothesis language, and its instantiation on an annotated corpus as the example language. Learning is set in a multi-class setting to deal with the multiple ontological relations. Results: We validated our approach on an annotated corpus of gene transcription regulations in the Bacillus subtilis bacterium. We reach a global recall of 89.3% and a precision of 89.6%, with high scores for the ten semantic relations defined in the ontology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Kernel-based machine learning methods have been used widely to extract PPI automatically, and several kernels focusing on different parts of sentence structure have been published for the PPI task. In this paper, we propose a method to combine kernels based on several syntactic parsers, in order to retrieve the widest possible range of important information from a given sentence. We evaluate the method using a support vector machine (SVM), and we achieve better results than other state-of-the-art PPI systems on four out of five corpora. Further, we analyze the compatibility of the five corpora from the viewpoint of PPI extraction, and we see that some of them have small incompatibilities, but they can still be combined with a little effort.

J	Oztekin, A; Delen, D; Kong, ZY				Oztekin, Asil; Delen, Dursun; Kong, Zhenyu (James)			Predicting the graft survival for heart-lung transplantation patients: An integrated data mining methodology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Survival analysis; Combined heart-lung transplantation; Classification; Data mining; Cox proportional hazards models	RENAL-TRANSPLANTATION; NETWORK; MODEL; PROGNOSIS; SINGLE; TIME	Background: Predicting the survival of heart-lung transplant patients has the potential to play a critical role in understanding and improving the matching procedure between the recipient and graft. Although voluminous data related to the transplantation procedures is being collected and stored, only a small subset of the predictive factors has been used in modeling heart-lung transplantation outcomes. The previous studies have mainly focused on applying statistical techniques to a small set of factors selected by the domain-experts in order to reveal the simple linear relationships between the factors and survival. The collection of methods known as 'data mining' offers significant advantages over conventional statistical techniques in dealing with the latter's limitations such as normality assumption of observations, independence of observations from each other, and linearity of the relationship between the observations and the output measure(s). There are statistical methods that overcome these limitations. Yet, they are computationally more expensive and do not provide fast and flexible solutions as do data mining techniques in large datasets. Purpose: The main objective of this study is to improve the prediction of outcomes following combined heart-lung transplantation by proposing an integrated data-mining methodology. Methods: A large and feature-rich dataset (16,604 cases with 283 variables) is used to (1) develop machine learning based predictive models and (2) extract the most important predictive factors. Then, using three different variable selection methods, namely, (i) machine learning methods driven variables-using decision trees, neural networks, logistic regression, (ii) the literature review-based expert-defined variables, and (iii) common sense-based interaction variables, a consolidated set of factors is generated and used to develop Cox regression models for heart-lung graft survival. Results: The predictive models' performance in terms of 10-fold cross-validation accuracy rates for two-multi-imputed datasets ranged from 79% to 86% for neural networks, from 78% to 86% for logistic regression, and from 71% to 79% for decision trees. The results indicate that the proposed integrated data mining methodology using Cox hazard models better predicted the graft survival with different variables than the conventional approaches commonly used in the literature. This result is validated by the comparison of the corresponding Gains charts for our proposed methodology and the literature review based Cox results, and by the comparison of Akaike information criteria (AIC) values received from each. Data mining-based methodology proposed in this study reveals that there are undiscovered relationships (i.e. interactions of the existing variables) among the survival-related variables, which helps better predict the survival of the heart-lung transplants. It also brings a different set of variables into the scene to be evaluated by the domain-experts and be considered prior to the organ transplantation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Towards application of rule learning to the meta-analysis of clinical data: An example of the metabolic syndrome	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Machine learning; Knowledge representation; Meta-analysis; Metabolic syndrome; Adipokines; Clinical data	FATTY LIVER-DISEASE; CAMPBELL COLLABORATION	Purpose: Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of published clinical datasets are important part of medical research. By combining results of multiple studies, meta-analysis is able to increase confidence in its conclusions, validate particular study results, and sometimes lead to new findings. Extensive theory has been built on how to aggregate results from multiple studies and arrive to the statistically valid conclusions. Surprisingly, very little has been done to adopt advanced machine learning methods to support meta-analysis. Methods: In this paper we describe a novel machine learning methodology that is capable of inducing accurate and easy to understand attributional rules from aggregated data. Thus, the methodology can be used to support traditional meta-analysis in systematic reviews. Most machine learning applications give primary attention to predictive accuracy of the learned knowledge, and lesser attention to its understandability. Here we employed attributional rules, the special form of rules that are relatively easy to interpret for medical experts who are not necessarily trained in statistics and meta-analysis. Results: The methodology has been implemented and initially tested on a set of publicly available clinical data describing patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). The objective of this application was to determine rules describing combinations of clinical parameters used for metabolic syndrome diagnosis, and to develop rules for predicting whether particular patients are likely to develop secondary complications of MS. The aggregated clinical data was retrieved from 20 separate hospital cohorts that included 12 groups of patients with present liver disease symptoms and 8 control groups of healthy subjects. The total of 152 attributes were used, most of which were measured, however, in different studies. Twenty most common attributes were selected for the rule learning process. By applying the developed rule learning methodology we arrived at several different possible rulesets that can be used to predict three considered complications of MS, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), simple steatosis (SS), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Instead of using manually designed rules and cumbersome parameters, our method establishes the relationship between L-system grammars and the iterative trend of botanical entities, which reflect the endogenous factors that caused the plant branching process. To realize this goal, we use a digital camera to take multiple images of unfoliaged (leafless) plants and capture the topological and geometrical data of plant entities using image processing methods. The data then stored into specific data structures. A Hidden Markov based statistical model is then employed to reveal the hidden relations of plant entities which have been classified into categories based on their statistical properties extracted by a classic EM algorithm, the hidden relations have been integrated into the target L-system as grammars. Results show that our method is capable of automatically generating L-grammars for a given unfoliaged plant no matter what branching type it is belongs to.

J	Tatar, S; Cicekli, I				Tatar, Serhan; Cicekli, Ilyas			Two learning approaches for protein name extraction	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Statistical learning; Bigram language model; Rule learning; Protein name extraction; Information extraction	MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; BIOMEDICAL TEXTS; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; BLAST	Protein name extraction, one of the basic tasks in automatic extraction of information from biological texts, remains challenging. In this paper, we explore the use of two different machine learning techniques and present the results of the conducted experiments. in the first method, Bigram language model is used to extract protein names. In the latter, we use an automatic rule learning method that can identify protein names located in the biological texts. In both cases, we generalize protein names by using hierarchically categorized syntactic token types. We conducted our experiments on two different datasets. our first method based on Bigram language model achieved an F-score of 67.7% on the YAPEX dataset and 66.8% on the GENIA corpus. The developed rule learning method obtained 61.8% F-score value on the YAPEX dataset and 61.0% on the GENIA corpus. The results of the comparative experiments demonstrate that both techniques are applicable to the task of automatic protein name extraction, a prerequisite for the large-scale processing of biomedical literature.

To tackle the challenge of heterogenous schema, an instance-based approach for schema mapping, named instance-based machine-learning (IML) approach was described. And to solve the problem of heterogenous instance, a novel approach, called statistic-based clustering (SBC) approach, which utilized clustering and statistics technologies to match large scale sources holistically, was also proposed. These two algorithms utilized the machine-leaning and clustering technology to improve the accuracy. Experimental analysis shows that the IML approach is more precise than SBC approach, reaching at least precision of 81% and recall rate of 82%. Simulation studies further show that SBC can tackle large scale sources holistically with 85% recall rate when there are 38 data sources.

We validated and successfully applied different state-of-the-art techniques for virtual screening (Bayesian machine learning, automated molecular docking, pharmacophore search, pharmacophore QSAR and shape analysis) of 4.6 million unique and readily available chemical structures to identify promising new and competitive antagonists of the strychnine-insensitive Glycine binding site (Glycine(B) site) of the NMDA receptor. The novelty of the identified virtual hits was assessed by scaffold analysis, putting a strong emphasis on novelty detection. The resulting hits were tested in vitro and several novel, active compounds were identified. While the majority of the computational methods tested were able to partially discriminate actives from structurally similar decoy molecules, the methods differed substantially in their prospective applicability in terms of novelty detection. The results demonstrate that although there is no single best computational method, it is most worthwhile to follow this concept of focused compound library design and screening, as there still can new bioactive compounds be found that possess hitherto unexplored scaffolds and interesting variations of known chemotypes.

A Knowledge-Based Approach for Item Exposure Control in Computerized Adaptive Testing	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS			English	Article						computerized adaptive testing; item exposure control; item exposure parameters; parallel item pools; machine learning; artificial neural networks	ALGORITHM	The purpose of this study is to investigate a functional relation between item exposure parameters (IEPs) and item parameters (IPs) over parallel pools. This functional relation is approximated by a well-known tool in machine learning. Let P and Q be parallel item pools and suppose IEPs for P have been obtained via a Sympson and Hetter-type simulation. Based on these simulated parameters, a functional relation k = f(P) (a, b, c) relating IPs to IEPs of P is obtained by an artificial neural network and used to estimate IEPs of Q without tedious simulation. Extensive experiments using real and synthetic pools showed that this approach worked pretty well for many variants of the Sympson and Hetter procedure. It worked excellently for the conditional Stocking and Lewis multinomial selection procedure and the Chen and Lei item exposure and test overlap control procedure. This study provides the first step in an alternative means to estimate IEPs without iterative simulation.

While this form of specification test compaction eliminates the need for expensive RF measurements, it also comes at the cost of reduced test accuracy, since the retained non-RF measurements and pertinent correlation models do not always suffice for adequately predicting the omitted RF measurements. To alleviate this problem, we explore several methodologies that estimate the confidence in the obtained test outcome. Subsequently, devices for which this confidence is insufficient are retested through the complete specification test suite. As we demonstrate on production test data from a zero-IF down-converter fabricated at IBM, the proposed methodologies overcome the inability of standard specification test compaction methods to reach industrially acceptable test quality levels, and enable efficient exploration of the tradeoff between test accuracy and test cost.

J	Na, JC; Thet, TT				Na, Jin-Cheon; Thet, Tun Thura			Effectiveness of web search results for genre and sentiment classification	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						genre classification; product review documents; sentiment classification; snippets; web search results	TERMS	The motivation of this study is to enhance general topical search with a sentiment-based one where the search results (snippets) returned by the web search engine are clustered by sentiment categories. Firstly we developed an automatic method to identify product review documents using the snippets (summary information that includes the URL, title, and summary text), which is genre classification. Then the identified snippets were automatically classified into positive (recommended) and negative (non-recommended) documents, which is sentiment classification. Thereafter the user may directly decide to access the positive or negative review documents. In this study we used only the snippets rather than their original full-text documents, and applied a common machine learning technique, SVM (support vector machine), and heuristic approaches to investigate how effectively the snippets can be used for genre and sentiment classification. The results show that the web search engine should improve the quality of the snippets especially for opinionated documents (i.e. review documents).

Recent years have seen an increasing body of work investigating methods to recognize favorable and unfavorable sentiments toward specific subjects from online text. However, most of these efforts focus on English and there have been very few studies on sentiment analysis of Chinese content. This paper aims to address the unique challenges posed by Chinese sentiment analysis. We propose a rule-based approach including two phases: (1) determining each sentence's sentiment based on word dependency, and (2) aggregating sentences to predict the document sentiment. We report the results of an experimental study comparing our approach with three machine learning-based approaches using two sets of Chinese articles. These results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and its advantages against learning-based approaches.

The availability of an automated computer analysis tool that is more objective than human readers can potentially lead to more reliable and reproducible brain tumor diagnostic procedures. A computer-assisted classification method combining conventional MRI and perfusion MRI is developed and used for differential diagnosis. The proposed scheme consists of several steps including region-of-interest definition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. The extracted features include tumor shape and intensity characteristics, as well as rotation invariant texture features. Feature subset selection is performed using support vector machines with recursive feature elimination. The method was applied on a population of 102 brain tumors histologically diagnosed as metastasis (24), meningiomas (4), gliomas World Health Organization grade II (22), gliomas World Health Organization grade III (18), and glioblastomas (34). The binary support vector machine classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation, were, respectively, 85%, 87%, and 79% for discrimination of metastases from gliomas and 88%, 85%, and 96% for discrimination of high-grade (grades III and IV) from low-grade (grade II) neoplasms. Multiclass classification was also performed via a onevs-all voting scheme. Magn Reson Med 62:1609-1618, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Wawrzynski, P				Wawrzynski, Pawel			Real-time reinforcement learning by sequential Actor-Critics and experience replay	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Direct adaptive control; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Experience replay	FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; POLICY EVALUATION; ALGORITHMS; GRADIENT	Actor-Critics constitute an important class of reinforcement learning algorithms that can deal with continuous actions and states in an easy and natural way. This paper shows how these algorithms can be augmented by the technique of experience replay without degrading their convergence properties, by appropriately estimating the policy change direction. This is achieved by truncated importance sampling applied to the recorded past experiences. It is formally shown that the resulting estimation bias is bounded and asymptotically vanishes, which allows the experience replay-augmented algorithm to preserve the convergence properties of the original algorithm. The technique of experience replay makes it possible to utilize the available computational power to reduce the required number of interactions with the environment considerably, which is essential for real-world applications. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate that the combination of experience replay and Actor-Critics yields extremely fast learning algorithms that achieve successful policies for non-trivial control tasks in considerably short time. Namely, the policies for the cart-pole swing-up [Doya, K. (2000). Reinforcement learning in continuous time and space. Neural Computation, 12(1), 219-245] are obtained after as little as 20 min of the cart-pole time and the policy for Half-Cheetah (a walking 6-degree-of-freedom robot) is obtained after four hours of Half-Cheetah time.

J	Trentin, E; Di Iorio, E				Trentin, Edmondo; Di Iorio, Ernesto			Classification of graphical data made easy	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Structured pattern recognition; Relational learning; Graph neural network; Molecule classification; Connectionist probability estimation	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPEECH RECOGNITION; MODELS	The classification of graphical patterns (i.e., data that are represented in the form of labeled graphs) is a problem that has been receiving considerable attention by the machine learning community in recent years. Solutions to the problem would be valuable to a number of applications, ranging from bioinformatics and cheminformatics to Web-related tasks, structural pattern recognition for image processing, etc. Several approaches have been proposed so far, e.g. inductive logic programming and kernels for graphs. Connectionist models were introduced too, namely recursive neural nets (RNN) and graph neural nets (GNN). Although their theoretical properties are sound and thoroughly understood, RNNs and GNNs suffer some drawbacks that may limit their application. This paper introduces an alternative connectionist framework for learning discriminant functions over graphical data. The approach is simple and suitable to maximum-a-posteriori classification of broad families of graphs, and overcomes some limitations of RNNs and GNNs. The idea is to describe a graph as an algebraic relation, i.e. as a subset of the Cartesian product. The class-posterior probabilities given the relation are then reduced (under an iid assumption) to products of probabilistic quantities, estimated using a multilayer perceptron. Empirical evidence shows that, in spite of its simplicity, the technique compares favorably with established approaches on several tasks involving different graphical representations of the data. In particular, in the classification of molecules from the Mutagenesis dataset (friendly + unfriendly) the best result to date (93.91%) is obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, ZB; Liu, JG; Chen, Z				Liu, Zhenbing; Liu, JianGuo; Chen, Zhong			A generalized Gilbert's algorithm for approximating general SVM classifiers	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Support vector machines; Maximal margin; Reduced convex hulls; Scaled convex hulls; Gilbert's algorithm	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION	Geometric methods provide an intuitive and theoretically solid viewpoint for the solution of many optimization problems in the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. The support vector machine (SVM) classification is a typical optimization task that has achieved excellent generalization performance in a wide variety of applications. In this paper, the notion of "scaled convex hull" (SCH) is presented, through which the nonseparable SVM classifications can be approximately transformed to separable ones: by a suitable selection of the reduction factor, the initially overlapping SCHs (each is generated by the training patterns of each class) can be reduced to become separable, then the maximal margin classifier between them can be trained, which is an approximation of the standard nonseparable SVM. As a practical application of the SCH framework, the popular Gilbert's algorithm has been generalized to approximately solve general (linear and nonlinear, separable and nonseparable) SVM classification problems both accurately and efficiently. The experiments show that the proposed method may achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods, an improved sequential minimal optimization and Gilbert's algorithm based on the reduced convex hull (RCH), in terms of the number of kernel evaluations and the execution time.

J	Yang, CY; Yang, JS; Wang, JJ				Yang, Chan-Yun; Yang, Jr-Syu; Wang, Jian-Jun			Margin calibration in SVM class-imbalanced learning	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Margin; Cost-sensitive learning; Class-imbalanced learning; Support vector machines; Classification	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; KERNEL; CONSISTENCY; CLASSIFIERS	Imbalanced dataset learning is an important practical issue in machine learning, even in support vector machines (SVMs). In this study, a well known reference model for solving the problem proposed by Veropoulos et al., is first studied. From the aspect of loss function, the reference cost sensitive prototype is identified as a penalty-regularized model. Intuitively, the loss function can change not only the penalty but also the margin to recover the biased decision boundary. This study focuses mainly on the effect from the margin and then extends the model to a more general modification. As proposed in the prototype, the modification first adopts an inversed proportional regularized penalty to re-weight the imbalanced classes. In addition to the penalty regularization, the modification then employs a margin compensation to lead the margin to be lopsided, which enables the decision boundary drift. Two regularization factors, the penalty and margin. are hence suggested for achieving an unbiased classification. The margin compensation, associating with the penalty regularization, is here utilized to calibrate and refine the biased decision boundary to further reduce the bias. With the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AuROC) for examining the performance, the modification shows relative higher scores than the reference model, even though the optimal performance is achieved by the reference model. Some useful characteristics found empirically are also included, which may be convenient for the future applications. All the theoretical descriptions and experimental validations show the proposed model's potential to compete for highly unbiased accuracy in a complex imbalanced dataset. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fang, B; Cheng, M; Tang, YY; He, GH				Fang, Bin; Cheng, Miao; Tang, Yuan Yan; He, Guanghui			Improving the discriminant ability of local margin based learning method by incorporating the global between-class separability criterion	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Manifold learning; Local discriminant analysis; Marginal Fisher analysis (MFA); Between-class separability criterion (BCSC)	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK; SPACE	Many applications in machine learning and computer vision come down to feature representation and reduction. Manifold learning seeks the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold structure hidden in the high-dimensional data. In the past few years, many local discriminant analysis methods have been proposed to exploit the discriminative submanifold structure by extending the manifold learning idea to supervised ones. Particularly, marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) finds the local interclass margin for feature extraction and classification. However, since the limited data pairs are employed to determine the discriminative margin, such method usually suffers from the maladjusted learning as we introduced in this paper. To improve the discriminant ability of MFA, we incorporate the marginal Fisher idea with the global between-class separability criterion (BCSC), and propose a novel supervised learning method, called local and global margin projections (LGMP), where the maladjusted learning problem can be alleviated. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed LGMP outperforms the original MFA. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our aim was to determine the effect of intestinal muscle inhibition on wall motion, dynamics of luminal content and transit in the small bowel. Fourteen healthy subjects ingested the endoscopic capsule (Pillcam, Given Imaging) in fasting conditions. Seven of them received glucagon (4.8 mu g kg-1 bolus followed by a 9.6 mu g kg-1 h-1 infusion during 1 h) and in the other seven, fasting activity was recorded, as controls. This dose of glucagon has previously shown to inhibit both tonic and phasic intestinal motor activity. Endoluminal image and displacement was analyzed by means of a computer vision programme specifically developed for the evaluation of muscular activity (contractile and non-contractile patterns), intestinal contents, endoluminal motion and transit. Thirty-minute periods before, during and after glucagon infusion were analyzed and compared with equivalent periods in controls. No differences were found in the parameters measured during the baseline (pretest) periods when comparing glucagon and control experiments. During glucagon infusion, there was a significant reduction in contractile activity (0.2 +/- 0.1 vs 4.2 +/- 0.9 luminal closures per min, P < 0.05; 0.4 +/- 0.1 vs 3.4 +/- 1.2% of images with radial wrinkles, P < 0.05) and a significant reduction of endoluminal motion (82 +/- 9 vs 21 +/- 10% of static images, P < 0.05). Endoluminal image analysis, by means of computer vision and machine learning techniques, can reliably detect reduced intestinal muscle activity and motion.

IP-LSSVM: A two-step sparse classifier	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Sparse classifier; Least squares support vector machine; Support vector automatic detection		We present in this work a two-step sparse classifier called IP - LSSVM which is based on Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). The formulation of LS-SVM aims at solving the learning problem with a system of linear equations. Although this solution is simpler, there is a loss of sparseness in the feature vectors. Many works on LS-SVM are focused on improving support vectors representation in the least squares approach, since they correspond to the only vectors that must be stored for further usage of the machine, which can also be directly used as a reduced subset that represents the initial one. The proposed classifier incorporates the advantages of either SVM and LS-SVM: automatic detection of support vectors and a solution obtained simply by the solution of systems of linear equations. IP - LSSVM was compared with other sparse LS-SVM classifiers from literature, LS(2) - SVM, Pruning, Ada - Pinv and RRS + LS - SVM. The experiments were performed on four important benchmark databases in Machine Learning and on two artificial databases created to show visually the support vectors detected. The results show that IP - LSSVM represents a viable alternative to SVMs, since both have similar features, supported by literature results and yet IP - LSSVM has a simpler and more understandable formulation.

A digital database was created from topographic and thematic maps, and allowed the generation of a digital elevation model (DEM) of the Dois Corregos (SP, Brazil) sheet (1:50,000 scale). The slope gradient, slope profile, contour profile, basin contributing area, and diagonal distance to drainage geomorphometric parameters were extracted from the DEM. The matrix which associated this georeferred data was analyzed by means of decision trees within the Weka machine-learning environment, and a model for soil mapping unit prediction was generated. The overall model accuracy increased from 54 to 61% when soil classes with no chances of being predicted were excluded. The association of data mining techniques with geographical information systems produced digital soil maps feasible to be used in studies requiring less detail than those made with the original reference soil maps.

We made multielectrode recordings from cat primary visual cortex and applied methods from machine learning in order to analyze the temporal evolution of stimulus-related information in the spiking activity of large ensembles of around 100 neurons. We used sequences of up to three different visual stimuli (letters of the alphabet) presented for 100 ms and with intervals of 100 ms or larger. Most of the information about visual stimuli extractable by sophisticated methods of machine learning, i.e., support vector machines with nonlinear kernel functions, was also extractable by simple linear classification such as can be achieved by individual neurons. New stimuli did not erase information about previous stimuli. The responses to the most recent stimulus contained about equal amounts of information about both this and the preceding stimulus. This information was encoded both in the discharge rates (response amplitudes) of the ensemble of neurons and, when using short time constants for integration (e.g., 20 ms), in the precise timing of individual spikes (<=similar to 20 ms), and persisted for several 100 ms beyond the offset of stimuli. The results indicate that the network from which we recorded is endowed with fading memory and is capable of performing online computations utilizing information about temporally sequential stimuli. This result challenges models assuming frame-by-frame analyses of sequential inputs.

Challenges Predicting Ligand-Receptor Interactions of Promiscuous Proteins: The Nuclear Receptor PXR	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							PREGNANE-X-RECEPTOR; IN-SILICO; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS; MULTIDIMENSIONAL QSAR; XENOBIOTIC RECEPTOR; INTRINSIC DISORDER; HORMONE-RECEPTORS; SIGNALING PATHWAY; COMPLEX PROVIDES	Transcriptional regulation of some genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification and apoptosis is performed via the human pregnane X receptor (PXR) which in turn is activated by structurally diverse agonists including steroid hormones. Activation of PXR has the potential to initiate adverse effects, altering drug pharmacokinetics or perturbing physiological processes. Reliable computational prediction of PXR agonists would be valuable for pharmaceutical and toxicological research. There has been limited success with structure-based modeling approaches to predict human PXR activators. Slightly better success has been achieved with ligand-based modeling methods including quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, pharmacophore modeling and machine learning. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis focused on prediction of 115 steroids for ligand binding activity towards human PXR. Six crystal structures were used as templates for docking and ligand-based modeling approaches (two-, three-, four-and five-dimensional analyses). The best success at external prediction was achieved with 5D-QSAR. Bayesian models with FCFP_6 descriptors were validated after leaving a large percentage of the dataset out and using an external test set. Docking of ligands to the PXR structure co-crystallized with hyperforin had the best statistics for this method. Sulfated steroids (which are activators) were consistently predicted as non-activators while, poorly predicted steroids were docked in a reverse mode compared to 5 alpha-androstan-3 beta-ol. Modeling of human PXR represents a complex challenge by virtue of the large, flexible ligand-binding cavity. This study emphasizes this aspect, illustrating modest success using the largest quantitative data set to date and multiple modeling approaches.

A diverse set of 641 compounds, including 414 active agents (PIs+) and 227. inactive agents (PIS-), are adopted to develop the classification models. A hybrid feature selection method, which combines Fischer's score and Monte Carlo simulated annealing embedded in the support vector machine approach, is used to select the relevant descriptors from a pool of 1559 molecular descriptors. Three validation methods are employed to validate the model in this study. The first one is the five-fold cross validation method and the averaged prediction accuracies for these machine learning approaches are between 83.9-93.5% for PIs+ and between 67.0-77.7% for PIs- agents. The second validation method is the external test set and the prediction accuracies for PIs+ are between 84.6 - 95.2% and for PIs -agents are between 63.2 - 87.7%. These two validation methods show that the SVM model has better overall performance than other three machine learning models. The third validation method is the y-scrambling method, which shows no obvious chance correction in the developed SVM model. The prediction method proposed in this work can give better generalization ability than other recently published methods and can be used as an alternative fast filter ill the virtual screening of large chemical database.

In this paper, we describe the main issues in applying descriptor selection for QSAR methods and propose a novel two-phase methodology for this task. The first phase makes use of a multi-objective evolutionary technique which yields interesting advantages compared to mono-objective methods. The second phase complements the first one and it enables to refine and improve the confidence in the chosen subsets of descriptors. This methodology allows the selection of subsets when a large number of descriptors are involved and it is also Suitable for linear and nonlinear QSAR/QSPR models. The proposed method was tested using three data sets with experimental values for blood-brain barrier penetration, human intestinal absorption and hydrophobicity. Results reveal the capability of the method for achieving subsets of descriptors with a high predictive capacity and a low cardinality. Therefore, our proposal constitutes a new promising technique helpful for the development of QSAR/QSPR models.

J	Williams, GJ				Williams, Graham J.			Rattle: A Data Mining GUI for R	R JOURNAL			English	Article								Data mining delivers insights, patterns, and descriptive and predictive models from the large amounts of data available today in many organisations. The data miner draws heavily on methodologies, techniques and algorithms from statistics, machine learning, and computer science. R increasingly provides a powerful platform for data mining. However, scripting and programming is sometimes a challenge for data analysts moving into data mining. The Rattle package provides a graphical user interface specifically for data mining using R. It also provides a stepping stone toward using R as a programming language for data analysis.

MACHINE LEARNING FOR THE ANALYSIS OF INDOOR RADON DISTRIBUTION, COMPARED WITH ORDINARY KRIGING	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Workshop on Physical Agents Environmental Monitoring	MAR 24-27, 2009	Vercelli, ITALY					Having a reliable forecasting tool is necessary to correctly identify radon prone areas, especially in cases where the variable of interest is the indoor radon concentration. An appropriate characterisation of the features of the buildings becomes fundamental. In this work, the results obtained ( in global and local scale) using the following approaches for estimating the concentration of indoor radon at locations that were not sampled were compared: geostatistical model, based on ordinary kriging, and machine learning (ML) technique. In the first case, algorithms designed for the specific and fine treatment ( by modelling the variographic structure) of the spatial component of the phenomenon were used, whereas in the second case a model that can also exploit information linked to other variables that characterise each single dwelling in which the measure was conducted was used. For locations having large errors, the ML approach provides better results, due to the information related to 'soil contact' and 'building material'.

J	Tang, JH; Qi, GJ; Wang, M; Hua, XS				Tang, Jinhui; Qi, Guo-Jun; Wang, Meng; Hua, Xian-Sheng			Video semantic analysis based on structure-sensitive anisotropic manifold ranking	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Video content analysis; Semantic annotation; Anisotropic; Manifold ranking; Semi-supervised learning	RELEVANCE-FEEDBACK	As a major family of semi-supervised learning (SSL), graph-based SSL has recently attracted considerable interest in the machine learning community along with application areas such as video semantic analysis. In this paper, we analyze the connections between graph-based SSL and partial differential equation- (PDE) based diffusion. From the viewpoint of PDE-based diffusion, the label propagation in normal graph-based SSL is isotropic accompanied with distance. However, according to the structural assumption, which is one of the two basic assumptions in graph-based SSL, we need to enhance the label propagation between the samples in the same structure while weakening the counterpart between the samples in different structures. Accordingly, we deduce a novel graph-based SSL framework, named structure-sensitive anisotropic manifold ranking (SSAniMR), from PDE-based anisotropic diffusion. Instead of using Euclidean distance only, SSAniMR takes local structural difference into account to make the label propagation anisotropic, which is intrinsically different from the isotropic label propagation process in general graph-based SSL methods. Experiments conducted on the TREC Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVID) dataset show that this approach significantly outperforms existing graph-based SSL methods and is effective for video semantic annotation.

A supervised learning approach to automate the acquisition of knowledge in surveillance systems	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Automated video surveillance; MPEG video analysis; Machine learning; Soft computing; Anomalous behaviour detection	GAIT RECOGNITION; FUZZY	This paper presents a machine learning-based method to build knowledge bases used to carry out surveillance tasks in environments monitored with video cameras, The method generates three sets of rules for each camera that allow to detect objects' anomalous behaviours depending on three parameters: object class, object position, and object speed. To deal with uncertainty and vagueness inherent in video surveillance we make use of fuzzy logic. Thanks to this approach we are able to generate a set of rules highly interpretable by security experts. Besides, the simplicity of the surveillance system offers high efficiency and short response time. The process of building the knowledge base and how to apply the generated sets of fuzzy rules is described in depth for a real environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ordinal response prediction using bootstrap aggregation, with application to a high-throughput methylation data set	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						ordinal response; classification trees; machine learning; bootstrap aggregating; gene expression	CLASSIFICATION	Many investigators conducting translational research are performing high-throughput genomic experiments and then developing multigenic classifiers using the resulting high-dimensional data set. In a large number of applications, the class to be predicted may be inherently ordinal. Examples of ordinal outcomes include tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (I, II, III, IV); drug toxicity evaluated as none, mild, moderate, or severe; and response to treatment classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease. While one can apply nominal response classification methods to ordinal response data, in doing so some information is lost that may improve the predictive performance of the classifier. This study examined the effectiveness of alternative ordinal splitting functions combined with bootstrap aggregation for classifying an ordinal response. We demonstrate that the ordinal impurity and ordered twoing methods have desirable properties for classifying ordinal response data and both perform well in comparison to other previously described methods. Developing a multigenic classifier is a common goal for microarray studies, and therefore application of the ordinal ensemble methods is demonstrated on a high-throughput methylation data set.

Breast cancer diagnosis using an artificial neural network trained by group search optimizer	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						classification; group search optimizer; neural network training	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLES	This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm: a group search optimizer (GSO) for training an artificial neural network (ANN) used for diagnosis of breast cancer. The GSO is inspired by animal social searching behaviour. Its global search performance has been proved competitive to other evolutionary algorithms and the particle swarm optimizer. The parameters of a three-layer feed-forward ANN, including connection weights and bias are tuned by the GSO algorithm. Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer data from the UCI Machine Learning repository are employed as a benchmark classification problem to evaluate the proposed method. In comparison with other sophisticated machine learning techniques used for ANN training, including some ANN ensembles, the GSO for ANN, GSOANN, has a better convergence rate and generalization performances for the breast cancer diagnosis problem.

In this paper, we proposed a global encoding method of protein sequence (GE) to descript global information of amino acid sequence, and then assign protein functional class using machine learning methods nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA). We predicted the function of 1818 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins which was used in Vazquez's global optimization method (GOM) except eight proteins which cannot get from the data base now or whose sequence length is too short. Using our approach, the computed accuracy is better than Vazquez's global optimization method (GOM) in some cases. The experiment results show that our new method is efficient to predict functional class of unknown proteins. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent research on protein binding site prediction has been mainly based on widely known machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, conditional random field, etc. However, the prediction performance is still too low to be used in practice. It is necessary to explore new algorithms, theories and features to further improve the performance. Results: In this study, we introduce a novel machine learning model hidden Markov support vector machine for protein binding site prediction. The model treats the protein binding site prediction as a sequential labelling task based on the maximum margin criterion. Common features derived from protein sequences and structures, including protein sequence profile and residue accessible surface area, are used to train hidden Markov support vector machine. When tested on six data sets, the method based on hidden Markov support vector machine shows better performance than some state-of-the-art methods, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines and conditional random field. Furthermore, its running time is several orders of magnitude shorter than that of the compared methods. Conclusion: The improved prediction performance and computational efficiency of the method based on hidden Markov support vector machine can be attributed to the following three factors. Firstly, the relation between labels of neighbouring residues is useful for protein binding site prediction. Secondly, the kernel trick is very advantageous to this field. Thirdly, the complexity of the training step for hidden Markov support vector machine is linear with the number of training samples by using the cutting-plane algorithm.

J	Castellini, C; Fiorilla, AE; Sandini, G				Castellini, Claudio; Fiorilla, Angelo Emanuele; Sandini, Giulio			Multi-subject/daily-life activity EMG-based control of mechanical hands	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							MYOELECTRIC CONTROL; AMPUTEES	Background: Forearm surface electromyography (EMG) has been in use since the Sixties to feed-forward control active hand prostheses in a more and more refined way. Recent research shows that it can be used to control even a dexterous polyarticulate hand prosthesis such as Touch Bionics's i-LIMB, as well as a multifingered, multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical hand such as the DLR II. In this paper we extend previous work and investigate the robustness of such fine control possibilities, in two ways: firstly, we conduct an analysis on data obtained from 10 healthy subjects, trying to assess the general applicability of the technique; secondly, we compare the baseline controlled condition (arm relaxed and still on a table) with a "Daily-Life Activity" (DLA) condition in which subjects walk, raise their hands and arms, sit down and stand up, etc., as an experimental proxy of what a patient is supposed to do in real life. We also propose a cross-subject model analysis, i.e., training a model on a subject and testing it on another one. The use of pre-trained models could be useful in shortening the time required by the subject/patient to become proficient in using the hand. Results: A standard machine learning technique was able to achieve a real-time grip posture classification rate of about 97% in the baseline condition and 95% in the DLA condition; and an average correlation to the target of about 0.93 (0.90) while reconstructing the required force. Cross-subject analysis is encouraging although not definitive in its present state. Conclusion: Performance figures obtained here are in the same order of magnitude of those obtained in previous work about healthy subjects in controlled conditions and/or amputees, which lets us claim that this technique can be used by reasonably any subject, and in DLA situations. Use of previously trained models is not fully assessed here, but more recent work indicates it is a promising way ahead.

J	Bostan, B; Greiner, R; Szafron, D; Lu, P				Bostan, Babak; Greiner, Russell; Szafron, Duane; Lu, Paul			Predicting homologous signaling pathways using machine learning	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS	Motivation: In general, each cell signaling pathway involves many proteins, each with one or more specific roles. As they are essential components of cell activity, it is important to understand how these proteins work-and in particular, to determine which of the species' proteins participate in each role. Experimentally determining this mapping of proteins to roles is difficult and time consuming. Fortunately, many pathways are similar across species, so we may be able to use known pathway information of one species to understand the corresponding pathway of another. Results: We present an automatic approach, Predict Signaling Pathway (PSP), which uses the signaling pathways in well-studied species to predict the roles of proteins in less-studied species. We use a machine learning approach to create a predictor that achieves a generalization F-measure of 78.2% when applied to 11 different pathways across 14 different species. We also show our approach is very effective in predicting the pathways that have not yet been experimentally studied completely.

However, choosing an appropriate classifier is not straight forward because each classifier has its own strengths and weaknesses, and each biological dataset has its own characteristics. By integrating many classifiers together, people call avoid the dilemma of choosing all individual classifier out of many to achieve in optimized classification results (Rahman et al., Multiple Classifier Combination for Character Recognition: Revisiting the Majority Voting System and Its Variation, Springer, Berlin. 2002, 167-178). The classification algorithms come front Weka (Witten and Frank, Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 2005) (a collection of software tools for machine learning algorithms). By integrating many predictors (classifiers) together through simple voting. the correct prediction (classification) rates are 65.21% and 65.63% for a basic training dataset and an independent test set, respectively. These results are better than any single machine learning algorithm collected in Weka when exactly the same data are used. Furthermore, we introduce an integration strategy which takes care of both classifier weightings and classifier redundancy. A feature selection strategy, called minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), is transferred into algorithm selection to deal with classifier redundancy in this research, and the weightings are based on the performance of each classifier. The best classification results are obtained when 11 algorithms are selected by mRMR method, and integrated together through majority votes with weightings.

On landmark selection and sampling in high-dimensional data analysis	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						dimension reduction; kernel methods; low-rank approximation; machine learning; Nystrom extension	NYSTROM METHOD; REDUCTION; EIGENMAPS	In recent years, the spectral analysis of appropriately defined kernel matrices has emerged as a principled way to extract the low-dimensional structure often prevalent in high-dimensional data. Here, we provide an introduction to spectral methods for linear and nonlinear dimension reduction, emphasizing ways to overcome the computational limitations currently faced by practitioners with massive datasets. In particular, a data subsampling or landmark selection process is often employed to construct a kernel based on partial information, followed by an approximate spectral analysis termed the Nystrom extension. We provide a quantitative framework to analyse this procedure, and use it to demonstrate algorithmic performance bounds on a range of practical approaches designed to optimize the landmark selection process. We compare the practical implications of these bounds by way of real-world examples drawn from the field of computer vision, whereby low-dimensional manifold structure is shown to emerge from high-dimensional video data streams.

J	Lee, WC; Wu, CC				Lee, Wen-Chiung; Wu, Chin-Chia			Some single-machine and m-machine flowshop scheduling problems with learning considerations	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Scheduling; Learning effect; Single-machine; Flowshop	TOTAL COMPLETION-TIME; 2-MACHINE FLOWSHOP; IMMUNE ALGORITHM; TARDINESS	Scheduling with learning effect has drawn many researchers' attention since Biskup [D. Biskup, Single-machine scheduling with learning considerations, European journal of Opterational Research 115 (1999) 173-178] introduced the concept of learning into the scheduling field. Biskup [D. Biskup, A state-of-the-art review on scheduling with learning effect, European journal of Opterational Research 188 (2008) 315-329] classified the learning approaches in the literature into two main streams. He claimed that the position-based learning seems to be a realistic model for machine learning, while the sum-of-processing-time-based learning is a model for human learning. In some realistic situations, both the machine and human learning might exist simultaneously. For example, robots with neural networks are used in computers, motor vehicles, and many assembly lines. The actions of a robot are constantly modified through self-learning in processing the jobs. On the other hand, the operators in the control center learn how to give the commands efficiently through working experience. In this paper, we propose a new learning model that unifies the two main approaches. We show that some single-machine problems and some specified flowshop problems are polynomially solvable.

J	Pei, YF; Wang, X; Zhang, XG				Pei, Yunfei; Wang, Xi; Zhang, Xuegong			Predicting the fate of microRNA target genes based on sequence features	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						MicroRNA; TargetmRNA; Repression; Degradation	PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; RECOGNITION; REPRESSION; MECHANISMS; RNA; DETERMINANTS; SPECIFICITY; PRINCIPLES; BIOGENESIS; IMPACT	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators that repress gene expression by binding to the 3'UTRs of their target mRNAs. There are two main outcomes for the transcripts targeted by miRNAs: mRNA degradation and translational repression. It is still unclear what factors determine whether a target transcript is degraded or translationally repressed. In this study, we collected two classes of genes that are targeted by miR-1, miR-155, miR-16, miR-30a, and let-7b and built new computational models with machine-learning methods to predict the fates of target genes based on sequence features. The prediction results indicate that the sequence context of the miRNA binding site at the 3'UTR of a target gene plays an important role in determining how an miRNA regulates the expression of its target. Further analysis shows that four out of the five studied miRNAs probably share similar regulatory mechanisms on their target genes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yoon, S; Kim, S				Yoon, Sejong; Kim, Saejoon			AdaBoost-based multiple SVM-RFE for classification of mammograms in DDSM	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Biomedical and Health Informatics	NOV 03, 2008	Philadelphia, PA				SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; GENE SELECTION; BREAST-CANCER	Background: Digital mammography is one of the most promising options to diagnose breast cancer which is the most common cancer in women. However, its effectiveness is enfeebled due to the difficulty in distinguishing actual cancer lesions from benign abnormalities, which results in unnecessary biopsy referrals. To overcome this issue, computer aided diagnosis (CADx) using machine learning techniques have been studied worldwide. Since this is a classification problem and the number of features obtainable from a mammogram image is infinite, a feature selection method that is tailored for use in the CADx systems is needed. Methods: We propose a feature selection method based on multiple support vector machine recursive feature elimination (MSVM-RFE). We compared our method with four previously proposed feature selection methods which use support vector machine as the base classifier. Experiments were performed on lesions extracted from the Digital Database of Screening Mammography, the largest public digital mammography database available. We measured average accuracy over 5-fold cross validation on the 8 datasets we extracted. Results: Selecting from 8 features, conventional algorithms like SVM-RFE and multiple SVM-RFE showed slightly better performance than others. However, when selecting from 22 features, our proposed modified multiple SVM-RFE using boosting outperformed or was at least competitive to all others. Conclusion: Our modified method may be a possible alternative to SVM-RFE or the original MSVM-RFE in many cases of interest. In the future, we need a specific method to effectively combine models trained during the feature selection process and a way to combine feature subsets generated from individual SVM-RFE instances.

We show that if memory and bandwidth are bounded at moving objects, then the problem of determining whether a set of data items can be disseminated to all the moving objects is NP-complete. For a heuristic solution we postulate that a moving object should save and transmit the data items that are most likely to be new (i.e., previously unknown) to future encountered moving objects. We propose a method to be used by each moving object to prioritize data items based on their probabilities of being new to future receivers. The method employs a machine learning system for estimation of the novelty probability and the machine learning system is progressively trained by received data items. Through simulations based on real mobility traces, we show the superiority of the method against some natural alternatives.
