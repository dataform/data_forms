J	Maheshwari, S; Brylinski, M				Maheshwari, Surabhi; Brylinski, Michal			Prediction of protein-protein interaction sites from weakly homologous template structures using meta-threading and machine learning	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION			English	Article						protein-binding site prediction; interfacial site prediction; meta-threading; machine learning; protein models; eThread; eFindSite(PPI)	T-CELL-RECEPTOR; DRUG DISCOVERY; BINDING-SITE; DATA-BANK; INTERFACES; DOCKING; SURFACE; INFORMATION; SEQUENCE; CONSERVATION	The identification of protein-protein interactions is vital for understanding protein function, elucidating interaction mechanisms, and for practical applications in drug discovery. With the exponentially growing protein sequence data, fully automated computational methods that predict interactions between proteins are becoming essential components of system-level function inference. A thorough analysis of protein complex structures demonstrated that binding site locations as well as the interfacial geometry are highly conserved across evolutionarily related proteins. Because the conformational space of protein-protein interactions is highly covered by experimental structures, sensitive protein threading techniques can be used to identify suitable templates for the accurate prediction of interfacial residues. Toward this goal, we developed eFindSite(PPI), an algorithm that uses the three-dimensional structure of a target protein, evolutionarily remotely related templates and machine learning techniques to predict binding residues. Using crystal structures, the average sensitivity (specificity) of eFindSite(PPI) in interfacial residue prediction is 0.46 (0.92). For weakly homologous protein models, these values only slightly decrease to 0.40-0.43 (0.91-0.92) demonstrating that eFindSite(PPI) performs well not only using experimental data but also tolerates structural imperfections in computer-generated structures. In addition, eFindSite(PPI) detects specific molecular interactions at the interface; for instance, it correctly predicts approximately one half of hydrogen bonds and aromatic interactions, as well as one third of salt bridges and hydrophobic contacts. Comparative benchmarks against several dimer datasets show that eFindSite(PPI) outperforms other methods for protein-binding residue prediction. It also features a carefully tuned confidence estimation system, which is particularly useful in large-scale applications using raw genomic data. eFindSite(PPI) is freely available to the academic community at http://www.brylinski.org/efindsiteppi.

Compensating for the effects of site and equipment variation on delphinid species identification from their echolocation clicks	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							SCORE NORMALIZATION; SPEAKER RECOGNITION; SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; VERIFICATION	A concern for applications of machine learning techniques to bioacoustics is whether or not classifiers learn the categories for which they were trained. Unfortunately, information such as characteristics of specific recording equipment or noise environments can also be learned. This question is examined in the context of identifying delphinid species by their echolocation clicks. To reduce the ambiguity between species classification performance and other confounding factors, species whose clicks can be readily distinguished were used in this study: Pacific white-sided and Risso's dolphins. A subset of data from autonomous acoustic recorders located at seven sites in the Southern California Bight collected between 2006 and 2012 was selected. Cepstral-based features were extracted for each echolocation click and Gaussian mixture models were used to classify groups of 100 clicks. One hundred Monte-Carlo three-fold experiments were conducted to examine classification performance where fold composition was determined by acoustic encounter, recorder characteristics, or recording site. The error rate increased from 6.1% when grouped by acoustic encounter to 18.1%, 46.2%, and 33.2% for grouping by equipment, equipment category, and site, respectively. A noise compensation technique reduced error for these grouping schemes to 2.7%, 4.4%, 6.7%, and 11.4%, respectively, a reduction in error rate of 56%-86%. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.

Aberrant epigenetic modifications are frequently linked to the development and maintenance of several diseases including cancer, inflammation and metabolic diseases and so on. The key proteins that mediate epigenetic modifications have been thus recognized as potential therapeutic targets for these diseases. Consequently, discovery of small molecule inhibitors for epigenetic targets has received considerable attention in recent years. Here, virtual screening methods and their applications in the discovery of epigenetic target inhibitors are the focus of this review. Newly emerging approaches or strategies including rescoring methods, docking pose filtering methods, machine learning methods and 3D molecular similarity methods were also underlined. They are expected to be employed for identifying novel inhibitors targeting epigenetic regulation more efficiently. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response variables that are functions (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although methods for analysing function-valued data have been available for several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare. We outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function (function regression') and introduce the r package FREE, which focuses on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented, including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on individual-size distributions (ISDs) of fish and trees. No single method performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to combine or compare fitted models. Function regression allows the direct modelling of many function-valued data (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity indices). Our ecological examples using ISD data show that larger rivers support more-even fish-size distributions than smaller rivers and that low initial planting densities lead to more-even tree-size distributions than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than conventional non-function-valued approaches.	[Yen, Jian D.

J	Yoo, H; Shon, T				Yoo, Hyunguk; Shon, Taeshik			Novel Approach for Detecting Network Anomalies for Substation Automation based on IEC 61850	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						IEC 61850; Substation automation; Smartgrid; Anomaly detection; Machine learning; EM; SVM		An SA (Substation Automation) system based on IEC 61850 is an intelligent substation; it has been receiving considerable attention as a core component of a smart grid. The explosive increase of threats to cyber security has been expanded to critical national infrastructures including the power grid. Substation Automation has also become a main target of cyber-attacks. Currently, various countermeasures such as firewalls, IDS (Intrusion Detection System)s, and anti-virus solutions have been developed, but to date, these have not sufficiently reflected the inherent features of Substation Automation based on IEC 61850. This study suggests a method of anomaly detection for MMS (Manufacturing Message Specification) and GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) packets, the main communication protocols of IEC 61850 Substation Automation. 3-Phase preprocessing, EM (Expect Maximization), and one-class SVM (Support Vector Machine) techniques are applied. The effectiveness of the suggested method is evaluated through experiments.

In this paper, we report on the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning to study the binding mechanism of a transition state analogue (DADMe-immucillin-H) to the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzyme. Microsecond-long MD simulations allow us to observe several binding events, following different dynamical routes and reaching diverse binding configurations. These simulations are used to estimate kinetic and thermodynamic quantities, such as k(on) and binding free energy, obtaining a good agreement with available experimental data. In addition, we advance a hypothesis for the slow-onset inhibition mechanism of DADMe-immucillin-H against PNP. Combining extensive MD simulations with machine learning algorithms could therefore be a fruitful approach for capturing key aspects of drug-target recognition and binding.

Despite methodological developments and novel application domains, there has been little effort to compile benchmark results that researchers can reference and compare against. This study takes a significant step in this direction. We employed three classes of state-of-the-art MVPA algorithms and common types of structural measurements from brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to predict an array of clinically relevant variables (diagnosis of Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder; age, cerebrospinal fluid derived amyloid-beta levels and mini-mental state exam score). We analyzed data from over 2,800 subjects, compiled from six publicly available datasets. The employed data and computational tools are freely distributed , making this the largest, most comprehensive, reproducible benchmark image-based prediction experiment to date in structural neuroimaging. Finally, we make several observations regarding the factors that influence prediction performance and point to future research directions. Unsurprisingly, our results suggest that the biological footprint (effect size) has a dramatic influence on prediction performance. Though the choice of image measurement and MVPA algorithm can impact the result, there was no universally optimal selection. Intriguingly, the choice of algorithm seemed to be less critical than the choice of measurement type. Finally, our results showed that cross-validation estimates of performance, while generally optimistic, correlate well with generalization accuracy on a new dataset.

A novel method to identify boundaries of basins of attraction in a dynamical system using Lyapunov exponents and Monte Carlo techniques	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Lyapunov exponents; Monte Carlo techniques; Basin of attraction (BoA); System stability analysis; Bifurcation analysis; Support vector machine learning algorithms	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; STABILITY ANALYSIS; POLYNOMIAL SYSTEMS; DOUBLE PENDULUM; TIME-SERIES; DOMAIN; VEHICLE; REGION; AFFINE	Stability analysis is a critical part of the study of a dynamical system that includes: finding the attractors of the system, determining their stability or instability, and identifying basins of attraction (BoAs) of the attractors. There are some classical methods for finding parts of BoAs, like Lyapunov-based and Non-Lyapunov-based methods; however, due to the limitations of the current methods, the identification of a complex boundary of a BoA is not feasible in addition to the high computational load of these methods. The concept of Lyapunov exponents is a powerful tool for performing stability analysis of highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, a new and intelligent approach for identifying the boundary of the entire BoA using Lyapunov exponents, Monte Carlo techniques, and support vector machine learning algorithm is developed. The proposed approach can identify the boundary of BoAs due to the intelligent sampling brought by Monte Carlo technique, which also dramatically reduces the computational load. Three illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We found that: (1) SVM and NB were superior to CART and KNN, and both could achieve high classification accuracy (> 90%); (2) the setting of tuning parameters greatly affected classification accuracy, particularly for the most commonly-used SVM classifier; the optimal values of tuning parameters might vary slightly with the size of training samples; (3) the size of training sample also greatly affected the classification accuracy, when the size of training sample was less than 125. Increasing the size of training samples generally led to the increase of classification accuracies for all four classifiers. In addition, NB and KNN were more sensitive to the sample sizes. This research provides insights into the selection of classifiers and the size of training samples. It also highlights the importance of the appropriate setting of tuning parameters for different machine learning classifiers and provides useful information for optimizing these parameters.

J	Castro-Munoz, G; Martinez-Carballido, J; Rosas-Romero, R				Castro-Munoz, Gloria; Martinez-Carballido, Jorge; Rosas-Romero, Roberto			A human action recognition approach with a novel reduced feature set based on the natural domain knowledge of the human figure	SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Human action recognition; Machine learning; Multi-class classifiers; Feature extraction; Video signal processing	HUMAN MOTION CAPTURE; VIDEO; REPRESENTATION; CLASSIFIER	Current video surveillance systems are not designed to raise an automatic alert in case of situations that put people lives at risk such as accidents, assaults and terrorism among others. This is due to the fact that these systems are not able to analyze huge amounts of video signals at higher processing speed where these signals come from cameras installed in the worldwide network. Faced with this situation, scientific communities are combining efforts to design algorithms and hardware to accelerate the processing of video signals. However, most of the methods proposed to date are too complex to be implemented in hardware at the place where the video camera is installed. In this paper, we report a significantly reduced novel feature set to design an analysis algorithm of significant less complexity which recognizes human actions from video sequences. The proposed method is based on the natural domain knowledge of the human figure such as proportions of the human body and foot positions. The analysis is characterized by working on sub-sequences of the entire video signals, processing a small fragment of the whole image, estimating the location of the region of interest, using simple operations (sum, subtraction, multiplications, divisions), extracting a reduced number of features per frame (6 features), and using a combination of four linear classifiers (one perceptron and three support vector machines) with a hierarchical structure. The method is evaluated on two of the datasets cited in the human action recognition literature, the Weizmann and the UIUC datasets. Results show that for the case of the Weizmann dataset, the correct classification rate (CCR) is 99.95% when the LOOCV Protocol is used and 98.38% for the case of Protocol 60-40, which is comparable or even higher than that of current state-of-the-art methods. Confusion matrices were also obtained for the UIUC dataset, where the obtained CCR is 100% for the case of the LOOCV Protocol and 99.35% when Protocol 60-40 is used. The experimental results are promising with much fewer features (between 85 and 113 times less features), compared with other methods, and the possibility of processing more than 200 fps.

Representation learning applies unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to large amounts of data to find building-blocks that better represent the information in it. Digitized histopathology images represents a very good testbed for representation learning since it involves large amounts of high complex, visual data. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of different supervised and unsupervised representation learning architectures to specifically address open questions on what type of learning architectures (deep or shallow), type of learning (unsupervised or supervised) is optimal. In this paper we limit ourselves to addressing these questions in the context of distinguishing between anaplastic and non-anaplastic medulloblastomas from routine haematoxylin and eosin stained images. The unsupervised approaches evaluated were sparse autoencoders and topographic reconstruct independent component analysis, and the supervised approach was convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that shallow architectures with more neurons are better than deeper architectures without taking into account local space invariances and that topographic constraints provide useful invariant features in scale and rotations for efficient tumor differentiation.

In this work, we focus on the well-known SAT-based approach to planning and investigate two types of learned knowledge: macro-actions and planning horizon. Macro-actions are sequences of actions that typically occur in the solution plans, while a planning horizon of a problem is the length of a (possibly optimal) plan solving it. We propose a method that uses a machine learning tool for building a predictive model of the optimal planning horizon, and variants of the well-known planner SatPlan and solver MiniSat that can exploit macro actions and learned planning horizons to improve their performance. An experimental analysis illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques demonstrating that significant speedups can be obtained.

With increasing awareness of the limitations of each individual tool and the development of highly targeted tests and predictions, the need for combining pieces of evidence increases. The discussions that took place during this workshop, which brought together a group of experts coming from different related areas, illustrate the current state of the art of ITS, as well as promising developments and identifiable challenges. The case of skin sensitization was taken as an example to understand how possible ITS can be constructed, optimized and validated. This will require embracing and developing new concepts such as adverse outcome pathways (AOP), advanced statistical learning algorithms and machine learning, mechanistic validation and "Good ITS Practices".

Prediction problems are divided into two categories: sparse classification and sparse regression. In classification, the clinical parameter to be predicted is binary, whereas in regression, the parameter is a real number. Well-known methods for both classes of problems are briefly discussed. These include the SVM(support vector machine) for classification and various algorithms such as ridge regression, LASSO( least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), and EN(elastic net) for regression. In addition, several well-established methods that do not directly fall into machine learning theory are also reviewed, including neural networks, PAM(pattern analysis for microarrays), SAM(significance analysis for microarrays), GSEA(gene set enrichment analysis), and k-means clustering. Several references indicative of the application of these methods to cancer biology are discussed.

Automated essay scoring (AES) generally relies on machine learning techniques that compute essay scores using a set of text variables. Unlike previous studies that rely on regression models, this study computes essay scores using a hierarchical approach, analogous to an incremental algorithm for hierarchical classification. The corpus in this study consists of 1243 argumentative (persuasive) essays written on 14 different prompts, across 3 different grade levels (9th grade, 11th grade, college freshman), and four different time limits for writing or temporal conditions (untimed essays and essays written in 10, 15, and 25 minute increments). The features included in the analysis are computed using the automated tools, Coh-Metrix, the Writing Assessment Tool (WAT), and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Overall, the models developed to score all the essays in the data set report 55% exact accuracy and 92% adjacent accuracy between the predicted essay scores and the human scores. The results indicate that this is a promising approach to AES that could provide more specific feedback to writers and may be relevant to other natural language computations, such as the scoring of short answers in comprehension or knowledge assessments.

It has a declining population trend due to anthropogenic pressures. Human-driven climate change is expected to have substantial impacts. However, quantitative and transparent information on the ecological niche (potential as well as realized) of this species across the vast and complex eight nations of the HKH region is lacking. Such baseline information is not only crucial for identifying new populations but also for restoring locally-extinct populations, for understanding its bio-geographical evolution, as well as for prioritizing regions and an efficient management. First we compiled, and made publicly available through an institutional repository (dSPACE), the best known 'presence only' red panda dataset with ISO compliant metadata. This was done through the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD.org) data-platform to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org). We used data mining and machine learning algorithms such as high-performance commercial Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest, TreeNet, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines implementations. We averaged all these Geographic Information System (GIS) models for the first produced ensemble model for this species in the HKH region. Our predictive model is the first of its kind and allows to assess the red panda distribution based on empirical open access data, latest methods and the major signals and drivers of the ecological niche. It allows to assess and fine-tune earlier habitat area estimates. Our models promote 'best professional practices'. It can readily be used by the red panda Recovery Team, the red panda Action Plan, etc. because they are robust, transparent, publicly available, fit for use, and have a good accuracy, as judged by several independent assessment metrics (Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC-AUC) curves, expert opinion, assessed by known absence regions, 95% confidence intervals and new field data).

Opportunistic "citizen science" observations submitted by hikers in remote alpine regions can be valuable, as coverage can be extensive compared to scientific field surveys. Here, we compare the performance of two regression and three machine learning statistical modeling approaches and an ensemble model to predict the distribution of the Vancouver Island subspecies of White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura saxatilis) based on two datasets: (1) field survey observations from radio-telemetry and call-playbacks, and (2) opportunistic citizen science observations submitted by hikers. Predictions of suitable habitat for the Vancouver Island subspecies varied from 370 to 1039 km(2) based on field survey observations and from 404 to 1354 km(2) based on public observations. All models had fair accuracy (kappa > 0.45) when tested on an independent dataset, but Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models tended to over-predict ptarmigan occurrence, had the lowest accuracy, and were most sensitive to the type of response data used. All the machine learning modeling techniques differed little between the datasets. These comparable results are encouraging for the continued use of citizen science monitoring programs, which can save both time and expense while involving and educating the public about threatened species. We advocate the use of opportunistic citizen science data and machine learning modeling techniques (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, and Maxent) for predicting alpine vertebrate species distributions.

Automated Training for Algorithms That Learn from Genomic Data	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Review							SIGNAL PEPTIDES; PROTEIN; SETS	Supervised machine learning algorithms are used by life scientists for a variety of objectives. Expert-curated public gene and protein databases are major resources for gathering data to train these algorithms. While these data resources are continuously updated, generally, these updates are not incorporated into published machine learning algorithms which thereby can become outdated soon after their introduction. In this paper, we propose a new model of operation for supervised machine learning algorithms that learn from genomic data. By defining these algorithms in a pipeline in which the training data gathering procedure and the learning process are automated, one can create a system that generates a classifier or predictor using information available from public resources. The proposed model is explained using three case studies on SignalP, MemLoci, and ApicoAP in which existing machine learning models are utilized in pipelines. Given that the vast majority of the procedures described for gathering training data can easily be automated, it is possible to transform valuable machine learning algorithms into self-evolving learners that benefit from the ever-changing data available for gene products and to develop new machine learning algorithms that are similarly capable.

The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist but can be difficult to be made in the early stages. Supporting paraclinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and investigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation are time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity may be a solution. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and nonseizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records. Our results show an improvement on existing studies by as much as 10% in most cases with a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 94%, and area under the curve of 98% with a 6% global error using a k-class nearest neighbour classifier. We propose that such an approach could have clinical applications in the investigation of patients with suspected seizure disorders.

J	Carroll, TL				Carroll, T. L.			Attractor comparisons based on density	CHAOS			English	Article							CHAOTIC TIME-SERIES; STRANGE ATTRACTORS; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; RECONSTRUCTION; DIMENSION; ERROR	Recognizing a chaotic attractor can be seen as a problem in pattern recognition. Some feature vector must be extracted from the attractor and used to compare to other attractors. The field of machine learning has many methods for extracting feature vectors, including clustering methods, decision trees, support vector machines, and many others. In this work, feature vectors are created by representing the attractor as a density in phase space and creating polynomials based on this density. Density is useful in itself because it is a one dimensional function of phase space position, but representing an attractor as a density is also a way to reduce the size of a large data set before analyzing it with graph theory methods, which can be computationally intensive. The density computation in this paper is also fast to execute. In this paper, as a demonstration of the usefulness of density, the density is used directly to construct phase space polynomials for comparing attractors. Comparisons between attractors could be useful for tracking changes in an experiment when the underlying equations are too complicated for vector field modeling.

In this paper, a novel approach based on crowd paths to solve this problem is presented, which collects and constructs automatically fingerprints database for anonymous buildings through common crowd customers. However, the accuracy degradation problem may be introduced as crowd customers are not professional trained and equipped. Therefore, we define two concepts: fixed landmark and hint landmark, to rectify the fingerprint database in the practical system, in which common corridor crossing points serve as fixed landmark and cross point among different crowd paths serve as hint landmark. Machine-learning techniques are utilized for short range approximation around fixed landmarks and fuzzy logic decision technology is applied for searching hint landmarks in crowd traces space. Besides, the particle filter algorithm is also introduced to smooth the sample points in crowd paths. We implemented the approach on off-the-shelf smartphones and evaluate the performance. Experimental results indicate that the approach can availably construct Wi-Fi fingerprint database without reduce the localization accuracy.

Digital technologies have the unique opportunity to support the creative process by (1) recognizing elements of students' creativity, such as when creativity is lacking (modeling step), and (2) providing tailored scaffolding based on that information (intervention step). However, to date little work exists on either of these aspects. Here, we focus on the modeling step. Specifically, we explore the utility of various sensing devices, including an eye tracker, a skin conductance bracelet, and an EEG sensor, for modeling creativity during an educational activity, namely geometry proof generation. We found reliable differences in sensor features characterizing low vs. high creativity students. We then applied machine learning to build classifiers that achieved good accuracy in distinguishing these two student groups, providing evidence that sensor features are valuable for modeling creativity.

China has a unique system archiving historical records of important social, meteorological, agricultural and biological events over the last three millennia. We derived historical species occurrences (0-2000 AD) based on a comprehensive review of literature. To detect the driving forces of range contraction, we used correlation and multiple regression to quantify the linear association between species range indices and climate variables (five temperature series and three precipitation series), as well as a human population size series. We also used a machine learning technique, random forest, to quantify the nonlinear effects of the climate variables and human population size. The southward retreat of the Asian elephant Elephas maximus and the rhinoceroses (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, Rhinoceros unicornis, R. sondaicus) was closely associated with climate cooling and intensified human impact (represented by high population size), and the westward retreat of the giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca was associated with intensified human impact. One temperature series and human population size showed interactive effect on range shift of the Asian elephant and the rhinoceroses; the effect of temperature was positive at low population size, but negative at high population size. Our results imply that a higher temperature caused the northward or eastward range shift of the Asian elephant, the rhinoceroses and the giant panda, and currently this trend is impeded by human activities. We also illustrate how human activity and climate act synergistically to cause range contraction.

Heritability is estimated as high as 90% for ASD with a recently reported compilation of 629 clinically relevant candidate and known genes. We chose to undertake a descriptive next generation whole exome sequencing case study of 30 well-characterized Caucasian females with autism (average age, 7.7 +/- 2.6 years; age range, 5 to 16 years) from multiplex families. Genomic DNA was used for whole exome sequencing via paired-end next generation sequencing approach and X chromosome inactivation status. The list of putative disease causing genes was developed from primary selection criteria using machine learning-derived classification score and other predictive parameters (GERP2, PolyPhen2, and SIFT). We narrowed the variant list to 10 to 20 genes and screened for biological significance including neural development, function and known neurological disorders. Seventy-eight genes identified met selection criteria ranging from 1 to 9 filtered variants per female. Five females presented with functional variants of X-linked genes (IL1RAPL1, PIR, GABRQ, GPRASP2, SYTL4) with cadherin, protocadherin and ankyrin repeat gene families most commonly altered (e. g., CDH6, FAT2, PCDH8, CTNNA3, ANKRD11). Other genes related to neurogenesis and neuronal migration (e. g., SEMA3F, MIDN), were also identified.

Selection criteria for observed astronomical objects are often too complicated to be derived from first principles. However the existence of an observed group of objects is a well-suited problem for machine learning classification. In this paper we use one-class classifiers to learn the properties of an observed catalog of clusters of galaxies from ROSAT and to pick clusters from mock simulations that resemble the observed ROSAT catalog. We show how this method can be used to study the cross-correlations of thermal Sunya'ev-Zeldovich signals with number density maps of X-ray selected cluster catalogs. The method reduces the bias due to hand-tuning the selection function and is readily scalable to large catalogs with a high-dimensional space of astrophysical features.

Bagging and Boosting are the most representative examples of algorithms for generating homogeneous ensembles of classifiers. However, Stacking has become a commonly used technique for generating ensembles of heterogeneous classifiers since Wolpert presented his study entitled Stacked Generalization in 1992. Studies that have addressed the Stacking issue demonstrated that when selecting base learning algorithms for generating classifiers that are members of the ensemble, their learning parameters and the learning algorithm for generating the meta-classifier were critical issues. Most studies on this topic manually select the appropriate combination of base learning algorithms and their learning parameters. However, some other methods use automatic methods to determine good Stacking configurations instead of starting from these strong initial assumptions. In this paper, we describe Stacking and its variants and present several examples of application domains.

In the experiment performed, Cartesian genetic programming (COP), multiple linear regression (MLR) and neural network (NN) methods were employed to predict paper properties. A total of 9 types of pulp suspension were employed as samples, and 47 properties of fibre in suspension state were evaluated. Handsheets made from each type of pulp suspension were then evaluated in terms of four optical properties. Using the pulp fibre and optical property data thus obtained, the prediction performance of each method was evaluated. The results showed that the use of models created using Cartesian genetic programming enables more accurate estimation of paper properties from pulp fibre properties than other methods.

Experimental focal neocortical epilepsy is associated with reduced white matter volume growth: results from multiparametric MRI analysis	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						White matter; Gray matter; Focal epilepsy; Rat brain; Structural MRI; Supervised segmentation	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; TETANUS TOXIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; RAT-BRAIN; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; EARLY ADULTHOOD; ADOLESCENCE; SEGMENTATION; MODEL	Focal epilepsy has recently been associated with remote white matter damage, including reduced white matter volume. Longitudinal assessment of these white matter changes, in relation to functional mechanisms and consequences, may be ideally done by in vivo neuroimaging in well-controlled experimental animal models. We assessed whether advanced machine learning algorithm models could accurately detect volumetric changes in white matter from multiparametric MR images, longitudinally collected in a neocortical focal epilepsy rat model. We measured classification accuracy in two supervised segmentation models: i.e. the generalized linear model and the nonlinear random forest model-by comparing computed white matter probabilities with actual neuroanatomically identified white matter. We found excellent overall discriminatory power for both models. However, the random forest model demonstrated a superior goodness-of-fit calibration plot that was close to the ideal calibration line. Based on this model, we measured that total white matter volume increased in young adult control and epileptic rats over a period of 10 weeks, but the average white matter volume was significantly lower in the focal epilepsy group. Changes in gray matter volume were not significantly different between control and epileptic rats. Our results (1) indicate that recurrent spontaneous seizures have an adverse effect on global white matter growth and (2) show that individual whole brain white matter volume can be accurately determined using a combination of multiparametric MRI and supervised segmentation models, offering a powerful tool to assess white matter volume changes in preclinical studies of neurological disease.

Among the large amount of features present in real life data sets, only a small fraction of them is effective to represent the data set accurately. Prior to analysis of the data set, preprocessing the data to obtain a smaller set of representative features and retaining the optimal salient characteristics of the data not only decrease the processing time but also lead to more compactness of the models learned and better generalization. In this regard, a novel dimensionality reduction method is presented here that simultaneously selects and extracts features using the concept of feature significance. The method is based on maximizing both relevance and significance of the reduced feature set, whereby redundancy therein is removed. The method is generic in nature in the sense that both supervised and unsupervised feature evaluation indices can be used for simultaneously feature selection and extraction. The effectiveness of the proposed method, along with a comparison with existing feature selection and extraction methods, is demonstrated on a set of real life data sets.

Pareto-Path Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; optimization methods; pattern recognition; supervised learning; support vector machines (SVM)		A traditional and intuitively appealing Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning (MT-MKL) method is to optimize the sum (thus, the average) of objective functions with (partially) shared kernel function, which allows information sharing among the tasks. We point out that the obtained solution corresponds to a single point on the Pareto Front (PF) of a multiobjective optimization problem, which considers the concurrent optimization of all task objectives involved in the Multitask Learning (MTL) problem. Motivated by this last observation and arguing that the former approach is heuristic, we propose a novel support vector machine MT-MKL framework that considers an implicitly defined set of conic combinations of task objectives. We show that solving our framework produces solutions along a path on the aforementioned PF and that it subsumes the optimization of the average of objective functions as a special case. Using the algorithms we derived, we demonstrate through a series of experimental results that the framework is capable of achieving a better classification performance, when compared with other similar MTL approaches.

HCCI engine operation is constrained by combustion instabilities, such as knock, ringing, misfires, high-variability combustion, and so on, and it becomes important to identify the operating envelope defined by these constraints for use in engine diagnostics and controller design. HCCI combustion is dominated by complex nonlinear dynamics, and a first-principle-based dynamic modeling of the operating envelope becomes intractable. In this paper, a machine learning approach is presented to identify the stable operating envelope of HCCI combustion, by learning directly from the experimental data. Stability is defined using thresholds on combustion features obtained from engine incylinder pressure measurements. This paper considers instabilities arising from engine misfire and high-variability combustion. A gasoline HCCI engine is used for generating stable and unstable data observations. Owing to an imbalance in class proportions in the data set, the models are developed both based on resampling the data set (by undersampling and oversampling) and based on a cost-sensitive learning method (by overweighting the minority class relative to the majority class observations). Support vector machines (SVMs) and recently developed extreme learning machines (ELM) are utilized for developing dynamic classifiers. The results compared against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive nonlinear ELM and SVM classification algorithms are well suited for the problem. However, the SVM envelope model requires about 80% more parameters for an accuracy improvement of 3% compared with the ELM envelope model indicating that ELM models may be computationally suitable for the engine application. The proposed modeling approach shows that HCCI engine misfires and high-variability combustion can be predicted ahead of time, given the present values of available sensor measurements, making the models suitable for engine diagnostics and control applications.

Improving an ED's timeliness of care, quality of care, and operational efficiency while reducing avoidable readmissions, is fraught with difficulties, which arise from complexity and uncertainty. In this paper, we describe an ED decision support system that couples machine learning, simulation, and optimization to address these improvement goals. The system allows healthcare administrators to globally optimize workflow, taking into account the uncertainties of incoming patient injuries and diseases and their associated care, thereby significantly reducing patient length of stay. This is achieved without changing physical layout, focusing instead on process consolidation, operations tracking, and staffing. First implemented at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, the system helped reduce length of stay at Grady by roughly 33 percent. By repurposing existing resources, the hospital established a clinical decision unit that resulted in a 28 percent reduction in ED readmissions. Insights gained from the implementation also led to an investment in a walk-in center that eliminated more than 32 percent of the nonurgent-care cases from the ED. As a result of these improvements, the hospital enhanced its financial standing and achieved its target goal of an average ED length of stay of close to seven hours. ED and trauma efficiencies improved throughput by over 16 percent and reduced the number of patients who left without being seen by more than 30 percent. The annual revenue realized plus savings generated are approximately $190 million, a large amount relative to the hospital's $1.5 billion annual economic impact. The underlying model, which we generalized, has been tested and implemented successfully at 10 other EDs and in other hospital units. The system offers significant advantages in that it permits a comprehensive analysis of the entire patient flow from registration to discharge, enables a decision maker to understand the complexities and interdependencies of individual steps in the process sequence, and ultimately allows the users to perform system optimization.

The classification and recognition of the iron ore grade were completed using their chemical properties and compositions. In addition, two parameters of the RF were optimized using out-of-bag (OOB) estimation. Finally, support vector machines (SVMs) and RF machine learning methods were evaluated comparatively on their ability to predict unknown iron ore samples using models constructed from a predetermined training set. Although results show that the prediction accuracies of SVM and RF models were acceptable, RF exhibited better predictions of classification. The study presented here demonstrates that LIBS-RF is a useful technique for the identification and discrimination of iron ore samples, and is promising for automatic real-time, fast, reliable, and robust measurements.

Development of a Novel Fingerprint for Chemical Reactions and Its Application to Large-Scale Reaction Classification and Similarity	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE; METHODOLOGY; PREDICTION; DESIGN; SYSTEM; BASE	Fingerprint methods applied to molecules have proven to be useful for similarity determination and as inputs to machine-learning models. Here, we present the development of a new fingerprint for chemical reactions and validate its usefulness in building machine-learning models and in similarity assessment. Our final fingerprint is constructed as the difference of the atom-pair fingerprints of products and reactants and includes agents via calculated physicochemical properties. We validated the fingerprints on a large data set of reactions text-mined from granted United States patents from the last 40 years that have been classified using a substructure-based expert system. We applied machine learning to build a 50-class predictive model for reaction-type classification that correctly predicts 97% of the reactions in an external test set. Impressive accuracies were also observed when applying the classifier to reactions from an in-house electronic laboratory notebook. The performance of the novel fingerprint for assessing reaction similarity was evaluated by a cluster analysis that recovered 48 out of 50 of the reaction classes with a median F-score of 0.63 for the clusters. The data sets used for training and primary validation as well as all python scripts required to reproduce the analysis are provided in the Supporting Information.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate algorithms for a physical activity monitoring system (PAMS) to detect wheelchair based activities. The PAMS consists of a gyroscope based wheel rotation monitor (G-WRM) and an accelerometer device (wocket) worn on the upper arm or on the wrist. A total of 45 persons with spinal cord injury took part in the study, which was performed in a structured university-based laboratory environment, a semi-structured environment at the National Veterans Wheelchair Games, and in the participants' home environments. Participants performed at least ten PAs, other than resting, taken from a list of PAs. The classification performance for the best classifiers on the testing dataset for PAMS-Arm (G-WRM and wocket on upper arm) and PAMS-Wrist (G-WRM and wocket on wrist) was 89.26% and 88.47%, respectively. The outcomes of this study indicate that multi-modal information from the PAMS can help detect various types of wheelchair-based activities in structured laboratory, semi-structured organizational, and unstructured home environments.

In our work we investigated role of gene variants form four core period proteins: CLOCK, ARNTL, TIM and PER3. The total sample comprised from 744 mood disorders inpatients (UPD = 229, BPD = 515) and 635 healthy voluntary controls. The 42 SNPs from four genes of interest were genotyped. We used single polymorphisms, haplotypes, SNPs interactions and prediction analysis using classical statistical and machine learning methods. We observed association between two polymorphisms of CLOCK (rs1801260 and rs11932595) with BPDII and two polymorphisms of TIM (rs2291739, rs11171856) with UPD. We also detected ARNTL haplotype variant (rs1160996C/rs11022779G/rs1122780T) to be associated with increased risk of MD, BPD (both types). We established significant epistatic interaction between PER3 (rs2172563) and ARNTL (rs4146388 and rs7107287) in case of BPD. Additionally relation between PER3 (rs2172563) and CLOCK (rs1268271 and rs3805148) appeared in case of UPD. Classification and Regression Trees (C and RT) showed significant predictive value for 10 polymorphisms in all analyzed genes. However we failed to obtain model with sufficient predictive power. During analyses of sleep disturbances sample, we found carriers of homozygote variants (ARNTL: rs11022778 TT, rs1562438 TT, rs1982350 AA and PER3: rs836755 CC) showing more frequent falling asleep difficulties when compare to other genotypes carriers. Our study suggested a putative role of the CLOCK, TIM, ARNTL and PER3 and polymorphisms in MD susceptibility.

Pinch-to-zoom, which is a common gesture in smart devices such as an iPhone or an Android phone, is used to control the size of images or web pages according to the distance between the thumb and index finger. To infer the finger motion, we recorded EMG signals obtained from the first dorsal interosseous muscle, which is highly related to the pinch-to-zoom gesture, and used a support vector machine for classification between four finger motion distances. The powers which are estimated by Welch's method were used as feature vectors. In order to solve the multiclass classification problem, we applied a one-versus-one strategy, since a support vector machine is basically a binary classifier. As a result, our system yields 93.38% classification accuracy averaged over six subjects. The classification accuracy was estimated using 10-fold cross validation. Through our system, we expect to not only develop practical prosthetic devices but to also construct a novel user experience (UX) for smart devices.

Despite the many advantages the sensor provides, however, the lack of a native capability to extract joints from the side view of a human body still limits the adoption of the device to a number of relevant applications. This paper presents an algorithm to locate and estimate the trajectories of up to six joints extracted from the side depth view of a human body captured by the Kinect device. The algorithm is then applied to extract data that can be exploited to provide an objective score for the "Get Up and Go Test", which is typically adopted for gait analysis in rehabilitation fields. Starting from the depth-data stream provided by the Microsoft Kinect sensor, the proposed algorithm relies on anthropometric models only, to locate and identify the positions of the joints. Differently from machine learning approaches, this solution avoids complex computations, which usually require significant resources. The reliability of the information about the joint position output by the algorithm is evaluated by comparison to a marker-based system. Tests show that the trajectories extracted by the proposed algorithm adhere to the reference curves better than the ones obtained from the skeleton generated by the native applications provided within the Microsoft Kinect (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA, 2013) and OpenNI (OpenNI organization, Tel Aviv, Israel, 2013) Software Development Kits.

Initially, one or more dedicated wearable sensors were used for such applications. However, recently, many researchers started using mobile phones for this purpose, since these ubiquitous devices are equipped with various sensors, ranging from accelerometers to magnetic field sensors. In most of the current studies, sensor data collected for activity recognition are analyzed offline using machine learning tools. However, there is now a trend towards implementing activity recognition systems on these devices in an online manner, since modern mobile phones have become more powerful in terms of available resources, such as CPU, memory and battery. The research on offline activity recognition has been reviewed in several earlier studies in detail. However, work done on online activity recognition is still in its infancy and is yet to be reviewed. In this paper, we review the studies done so far that implement activity recognition systems on mobile phones and use only their on-board sensors. We discuss various aspects of these studies. Moreover, we discuss their limitations and present various recommendations for future research.	[Shoaib, Muhammad; Bosch, Stephan; Scholten, Hans; Havinga, Paul J.

In this study, recently proposed supervised classification techniques, tested by the machine-learning community, are applied to forecast the recruitment of seven fish species of North East Atlantic (anchovy, sardine, mackerel, horse mackerel, hake, blue whiting and albacore), using spawning, environmental and climatic data. In addition, the use of the probabilistic flexible naive Bayes classifier (FNBC) is proposed as modelling approach in order to reduce uncertainty for fisheries management purposes. Those improvements aim is to improve probability estimations of each possible outcome (low, medium and high recruitment) based in kernel density estimation, which is crucial for informed management decision making with high uncertainty. Finally, a comparison between goodness-of-fit and generalization power is provided, in order to assess the reliability of the final forecasting models. It is found that in most cases the proposed methodology provides useful information for management whereas the case of horse mackerel is an example of the limitations of the approach. The proposed improvements allow for a better probabilistic estimation of the different scenarios, i.e. to reduce the uncertainty in the provided forecasts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although recent developments have slightly exceeded previous methods of SS prediction, accuracy has stagnated around 80 percent and many wonder if prediction cannot be advanced beyond this ceiling. Disciplines that have traditionally employed neural networks are experimenting with novel deep learning techniques in attempts to stimulate progress. Since neural networks have historically played an important role in SS prediction, we wanted to determine whether deep learning could contribute to the advancement of this field as well. We developed an SS predictor that makes use of the position-specific scoring matrix generated by PSI-BLAST and deep learning network architectures, which we call DNSS. Graphical processing units and CUDA software optimize the deep network architecture and efficiently train the deep networks. Optimal parameters for the training process were determined, and a workflow comprising three separately trained deep networks was constructed in order to make refined predictions. This deep learning network approach was used to predict SS for a fully independent test dataset of 198 proteins, achieving a Q(3) accuracy of 80.7 percent and a Sov accuracy of 74.2 percent.

The novelties of the paper are: the extension of an already developed method to coarse resolution data (150 m) in mountain environment with high land heterogeneity, with only VV polarization and the proper selection of input features. During the result analysis, several algorithm characteristics were clearly identified: 1) the performances showed to be strongly related to input features such as topography and vegetation indices; 2) the algorithm needs a training phase; 3) the averaging window needs to be proper selected to take into account both the speckle noise and the characteristics of the area under investigation; and 4) the algorithm, being data driven, can be considered as site dependent. The experimental analysis is carried out on images acquired over the Sudtirol/Alto Adige Province in Italy during 2010-2011 from the RADARSAT2 and Envisat ASAR in Wide Swath mode. SMC maps were compared with spatially distributed ground measurements, resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) value ranging from 0.045 to 0.07 m(3)/m(3). Concerning the multiscale analysis, the results indicated that RADARSAT2 maps are able to detect the spatial heterogeneity and soil moisture dynamics at local scale, while ASAR WS SMC maps are able to identify mainly the two main classes of pasture and meadows. When these estimates are compared with SMC values from meteorological stations a RMSE value of 0.10 m(3)/m(3) for both satellites indicated a reduced capability to follow the temporal dynamics.

However, most distributed graph-parallel systems are oblivious to the unique characteristics in such graphs and existing online graph partitioning algorithms usually cause excessive replication of vertices as well as significant pressure on network communication. This article identifies the challenges and opportunities of partitioning bipartite graphs for distributed MLDM processing and proposes BiGraph, a set of bipartite-oriented graph partitioning algorithms. BiGraph leverages observations such as the skewed distribution of vertices, discriminated computation load and imbalanced data sizes between the two subsets of vertices to derive a set of optimal graph partitioning algorithms that result in minimal vertex replication and network communication. BiGraph has been implemented on Power Graph and is shown to have a performance boost up to 17.75X (from 1.16X) for four typical MLDM algorithms, due to reducing up to 80% vertex replication, and up to 96% network traffic.

However, for durable products, customer purchases, and reviews only once for a long time, as while the product review score may highly affected by service factors or be "gently"evaluated. Existing regression or machine learning-based methods suffer from low accuracy when applied to the OCRs of durable products on e-commerce web sites. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new approach for customer segment analysis base on OCRs of durable products. Design/methodology/approach - The research proposes a two-stage approach that employs latent class analysis (LCA): the feature-mention matrix construction stage and the LCA-based customer segmentation stage. The approach considers reviewers' mention on product features, and the probability-based LCA method is adopted upon the characteristics of online reviews, to effectively cluster reviewers into specified segmentations. Findings - The research finding is that, using feature-mention instead of feature-opinion records makes segment analysis more effective. The research also finds that, LCA method can better explain the characteristics of the OCR data of durable products for customer segmentation. Practical implications - The research proposes a new approach to durable product review mining for customer segmentation analysis. The segment analysis result can provide supports for new product design and development, repositioning of existing products, marketing strategy development and product differentiation. Originality/value - A new approach for customer segmentation analysis base on OCRs of durable products is proposed.

The development of automatic methods based on computer vision could have positive implications for the food processing industry. In the brewing industry, varietal uniformity is crucial for the production of high quality malt. The varietal purity of thousands of tons of grain has to be inspected upon purchase in the malt house. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of identification of barley varieties based on image-derived shape, color and texture attributes of individual kernels. Varieties can be determined by means of discriminant analysis, including reduction of feature space dimensionality, linear classifier ensembles and artificial neural networks, with high balanced accuracy ranging from 67% to 86%. The study demonstrated that classification results can be significantly improved by standardizing individual kernel images in terms of their anteroposterior and dorsoventral orientation and performing additional analyses of wrinkled regions.

J	Rahman, A; D'Este, C				Rahman, Ashfaqur; D'Este, Claire			Shellfish farm closure prediction and cause identification using machine learning methods	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Ensemble feature ranking; Prediction; Shellfish farm closure prediction	DECISION-SUPPORT; MANAGEMENT	Shellfish farms are needed to be closed if they are contaminated during their production as otherwise it may lead to serious health hazard. The authorities monitor a number of water quality variables to check the health of shellfish farms and to decide on the closure of the farms. The research presented in this paper aims to automate this process by developing novel algorithms to identify the cause of closure and also predicting the closure. As the frequency of closure is relatively very small, the labelled data sets are imbalanced in nature. We have developed a novel ensemble feature ranking algorithm that explicitly deals with class imbalance problem and identifies the cause of closure. We have also presented a class balancing ensemble classifier to predict shellfish farm closure. The class balancing ensemble classifier predicts closure/opening with as high as 71.69% accuracy and achieves best balancing act with decision tree base classifier in 75% locations. Rain and salinity are found to be the key causes of closure and the causality depends of the properties of the locations. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For comparison with atmospheric CO2 measurements, the LMDZ4 transport model was run with time-varying CO2 fluxes of each model as surface boundary conditions. Seven out of the nine models overestimate the seasonal amplitude of GPP and produce a too early start in spring at most flux sites. Despite their positive bias for GPP, the nine models underestimate NEE at most flux sites and in the Northern Hemisphere compared with MTE-NEE. Comparison with surface atmospheric CO2 measurements confirms that most models underestimate the seasonal amplitude of NEE in the Northern Hemisphere (except CLM4C and SDGVM). Comparison with TCCON data also shows that the seasonal amplitude of X-CO2 is underestimated by more than 10% for seven out of the nine models (except for CLM4C and SDGVM) and that the MTE-NEE product is closer to the TCCON data using LMDZ4. From CO2 columns measured routinely at 10 TCCON sites, the constrained amplitude of NEE over the Northern Hemisphere is of 1.60.4 gC m(-2)d(-1), which translates into a net CO2 uptake during the carbon uptake period in the Northern Hemisphere of 7.92.0 PgC yr(-1).

Assessing machine-learning algorithms and image- and lidar-derived variables for GEOBIA classification of mining and mine reclamation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; OBJECT-BASED CLASSIFICATION; RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY; SATELLITE IMAGERY; IKONOS IMAGERY; URBAN AREAS; CENTRAL APPALACHIANS	This study investigates machine-learning algorithms and measures derived from RapidEye satellite imagery and light detection and ranging (lidar) data for geographic object-based image analysis classification of mining and mine reclamation. Support vector machines, random forests, and boosted classification and regression trees classification algorithms were assessed and compared with the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier. For geographic object-based image analysis classification of mine landscapes, the use of disparate data (i.e. lidar data) improved overall accuracy, whereas the use of complex, object-oriented variables such as object geometry measures, first-order texture, and second-order texture from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix decreased or did not improve the classification accuracy. Support vector machines generally outperformed k-NN and the ensemble tree classifiers when only using the band means. With the incorporation of lidar-descriptive statistics, all four algorithms provided statistically comparable accuracies. K-NN suffered reduced classification accuracy with high-dimensional feature spaces, suggesting that a more complex machine-learning algorithm may be more appropriate when a large number of predictor variables are used.

Here we present a field-portable and cost-effective platform for detection and quantification of Giardia lamblia cysts, one of the most common waterborne parasites, which has a thick cell wall that makes it resistant to most water disinfection techniques including chlorination. The platform consists of a smartphone coupled with an opto-mechanical attachment weighing similar to 205 g, which utilizes a hand-held fluorescence microscope design aligned with the camera unit of the smartphone to image customdesigned disposable water sample cassettes. Each sample cassette is composed of absorbent pads and mechanical filter membranes; a membrane with 8 mu m pore size is used as a porous spacing layer to prevent the backflow of particles to the upper membrane, while the top membrane with 5 mu m pore size is used to capture the individual Giardia cysts that are fluorescently labeled. A fluorescence image of the filter surface (field-of-view: similar to 0.8 cm(2)) is captured and wirelessly transmitted via the mobile-phone to our servers for rapid processing using a machine learning algorithm that is trained on statistical features of Giardia cysts to automatically detect and count the cysts captured on the membrane. The results are then transmitted back to the mobile-phone in less than 2 minutes and are displayed through a smart application running on the phone. This mobile platform, along with our custom-developed sample preparation protocol, enables analysis of large volumes of water (e.g., 10-20 mL) for automated detection and enumeration of Giardia cysts in similar to 1 hour, including all the steps of sample preparation and analysis. We evaluated the performance of this approach using flow-cytometer-enumerated Giardia-contaminated water samples, demonstrating an average cyst capture efficiency of similar to 79% on our filter membrane along with a machine learning based cyst counting sensitivity of similar to 84%, yielding a limit-of-detection of similar to 12 cysts per 10 mL. Providing rapid detection and quantification of microorganisms, this field-portable imaging and sensing platform running on a mobile-phone could be useful for water quality monitoring in field and resource-limited settings.

This review presents a simple discriminative learning framework for defining such models and relating them to logical theories. Within this framework, we discuss the task of learning to map utterances to logical forms (semantic parsing) and the task of learning from denotations with logical forms as latent variables. We also consider models that use distributed (e.g., vector) representations rather than logical ones, showing that these can be considered part of the same overall framework for understanding meaning and structural complexity.

Predicting crystallinity of molecular materials	CRYSTENGCOMM			English	Article							SMALL ORGANIC-MOLECULES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; BLIND TEST; PROTEIN CRYSTALLIZATION; QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE; ENERGY LANDSCAPE; GROWTH; POLYMORPHISM; SOLUBILITY; DATABASE	Predicting and controlling crystallinity of molecular materials has applications in a crystal engineering context, as well as process control and formulation in the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we present a machine learning approach to this problem which uses a large input training set which is classified on a single measurable outcome: does a substance have a reasonable probability of forming good quality crystals. While the related problem of crystal structure prediction requires reliable calculation of three dimensional molecular conformations, the method employed here for predicting crystallisation propensity uses only "two dimensional" information consisting of atom types and connectivity. We show that an error rate lower than 10% can be achieved against unseen test data. The predictive model was also tested in a blind screen of a set of compounds which do not have crystal structures reported in the literature, and we found it to have a 79% classification accuracy. Analysis of the most significant descriptors used in the classification shows that the number of rotatable bonds and a molecular connectivity index are key in determining crystallisation propensity and using these two measures alone can give 80% accurate classification of unseen test data.

In this context, the automated learning of a suitable basis or overcomplete dictionary from training data sets of certain signal classes for use in sparse representations has turned out to be of particular importance regarding practical signal processing applications. Most popular dictionary learning algorithms involve NP-hard sparse recovery problems in each iteration, which may give some indication about the complexity of dictionary learning but does not constitute an actual proof of computational intractability. In this technical note, we show that learning a dictionary with which a given set of training signals can be represented as sparsely as possible is indeed NP-hard. Moreover, we also establish hardness of approximating the solution to within large factors of the optimal sparsity level. Furthermore, we give NP-hardness and non-approximability results for a recent dictionary learning variation called the sensor permutation problem. Along the way, we also obtain a new non-approximability result for the classical sparse recovery problem from compressed sensing.

Graph Optimized Laplacian Eigenmaps for Face Recognition	INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND COMPUTER VISION XXXII: ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXXII - Algorithms and Techniques	FEB 09-10, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		Linear Dimensionality Reduction; Laplacian Eigenmaps; graph optimization; face recognition	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS	In recent years, a variety of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques (NLDR) have been proposed in the literature. They aim to address the limitations of traditional techniques such as PCA and classical scaling. Most of these techniques assume that the data of interest lie on an embedded non-linear manifold within the higher-dimensional space. They provide a mapping from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional embedding and may be viewed, in the context of machine learning, as a preliminary feature extraction step, after which pattern recognition algorithms are applied. Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) is a nonlinear graph-based dimensionality reduction method. It has been successfully applied in many practical problems such as face recognition. However the construction of LE graph suffers, similarly to other graph-based DR techniques from the following issues: (1) the neighborhood graph is artificially defined in advance, and thus does not necessary benefit the desired DR task; (2) the graph is built using the nearest neighbor criterion which tends to work poorly due to the high-dimensionality of original space; and (3) its computation depends on two parameters whose values are generally uneasy to assign, the neighborhood size and the heat kernel parameter. To address the above-mentioned problems, for the particular case of the LPP method (a linear version of LE), L. Zhang et al. 1 have developed a novel DR algorithm whose idea is to integrate graph construction with specific DR process into a unified framework. This algorithm results in an optimized graph rather than a predefined one.

Fine Grained Recognition of Masonry Walls for Built Heritage Assessment	INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND COMPUTER VISION XXXII: ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXXII - Algorithms and Techniques	FEB 09-10, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		Built heritage analysis; fine grained visual categorization; classifier; feature selection	BUILDINGS; PHOTOGRAMMETRY	This paper presents the ground work carried out to achieve automatic fine grained recognition of stone masonry. This is a necessary first step in the development of the analysis tool. The built heritage that will be assessed consists of stone masonry constructions and many of the features analysed can be characterized according to the geometry and arrangement of the stones. Much of the assessment is carried out through visual inspection. Thus, we apply image processing on digital images of the elements under inspection. The main contribution of the paper is the performance evaluation of the automatic categorization of masonry walls from a set of extracted straight line segments.

Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of the different V3 loop-based genotypic algorithms available. We compiled a dataset of 645 HIV-1 subtype C V3 loop sequences of known coreceptor phenotypes (531 R5-tropic/non-syncytium-inducing and 114 X4-tropic/R5X4-tropic/syncytium-inducing sequences) from the Los Alamos database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/) and previously published literature. Co-receptor usage was predicted based on this dataset using different software-based machine-learning algorithms as well as simple classical rules. All the sophisticated machine-learning methods showed a good concordance of above 85%. Geno2Pheno (false-positive rate cutoff of 5-15%) and CoRSeqV3-C were found to have a high predicting capability in determining both HIV-1 subtype C X4-tropic and R5-tropic strains. The current sophisticated genotypic tropism tools based on V3 loop perform well for tropism prediction in HIV-1 subtype C strains and can be used in clinical settings. (C) 2015 S.

On one hand, the memory and time cost should be reduced. On the other hand, the step edges of the results obtained by the existing methods are not clear enough. We do the following work. First, we propose a method to extract the midfrequency features for dictionary learning. This method brings the benefit of a reduction of the memory and time complexity without sacrificing the performance. Second, we propose a detailed wiping-off total variation (DWO-TV) regularization model to reconstruct the sharp step edges. This model adds a novel constraint on the downsampling version of the high-resolution image to wipe off the details and artifacts and sharpen the step edges. Finally, step edges produced by the DWO-TV regularization and the details provided by learning are fused. Experimental results show that the proposed method offers a desirable compromise between low time and memory cost and the reconstruction quality.

There are three major types of lung cancers, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and carcinoid. NSCLC is further classified into lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), squamous cell lung cancer (SQCLC) as well as large cell lung cancer. Many previous studies demonstrated that DNA methylation has emerged as potential lung cancer-specific biomarkers. However, whether there exists a set of DNA methylation markers simultaneously distinguishing such three types of lung cancers remains elusive. In the present study, ROC (Receiving Operating Curve), RFs (Random Forests) and mRMR (Maximum Relevancy and Minimum Redundancy) were proposed to capture the unbiased, informative as well as compact molecular signatures followed by machine learning methods to classify LADC, SQCLC and SCLC. As a result, a panel of 16 DNA methylation markers exhibits an ideal classification power with an accuracy of 86.54%, 84.6% and a recall 84.37%, 85.5% in the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and independent data set test experiments, respectively. Besides, comparison results indicate that ensemble-based feature selection methods outperform individual ones when combined with the incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy in terms of the informative and compact property of features. Taken together, results obtained suggest the effectiveness of the ensemble-based feature selection approach and the possible existence of a common panel of DNA methylation markers among such three types of lung cancer tissue, which would facilitate clinical diagnosis and treatment.

The Classifynder is an imaging microscopy system that can locate, image and classify slide based pollen samples. Given the laboriousness of purely manual image acquisition and identification it is vital to exploit assistive technologies like the Classifynder to enable acquisition and analysis of pollen samples. It is also vital that we understand the strengths and limitations of automated systems so that they can be used (and improved) to compliment the strengths and weaknesses of human analysts to the greatest extent possible. This article reviews some of our experiences with the Classifynder system and our exploration of alternative classifier models to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. Our experiments in the pollen analysis problem domain have been based on samples from the Australian National University's pollen reference collection (2,890 grains, 15 species) and images bundled with the Classifynder system (400 grains, 4 species). These samples have been represented using the Classifynder image feature set. We additionally work case study where we assess the ability of the system to determine the pollen make-up of samples of New Zealand honey. In addition to the Classifynder's native neural network classifier, we have evaluated linear discriminant, support vector machine, decision tree and random forest classifiers on these data with encouraging results. Our hope is that our findings will help enhance the performance of future releases of the Classifynder and other systems for accelerating the acquisition and analysis of pollen samples.

The uFilter improves the Mann-Whitney U-test for reducing dimensionality and ranking features in binary classification problems. Also, it presented a practical uFilter application on breast cancer computer-aided diagnosis (CADx). Materials and methods: A total of 720 datasets (ranked subsets of features) were formed by the application of the chi-square (CHI2) discretization, information-gain (IG), one-rule (1Rule), Relief, uFilter and its theoretical basis method (named U-test). Each produced dataset was used for training feed-forward backpropagation neural network, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis and naive Bayes machine learning algorithms to produce classification scores for further statistical comparisons. Results: A head-to-head comparison based on the mean of area under receiver operating characteristics curve scores against the U-test method showed that the uFilter method significantly outperformed the U-test method for almost all classification schemes (p < 0.05); it was superior in 50%; tied in a 37.5% and lost in a 12.5% of the 24 comparative scenarios. Also, the performance of the uFilter method, when compared with CHI2 discretization, IC, 1Rule and Relief methods, was superior or at least statistically similar on the explored datasets while requiring less number of features. Conclusions: The experimental results indicated that uFilter method statistically outperformed the U-test method and it demonstrated similar, but not superior, performance than traditional feature selection methods (CHI2 discretization, IG, 1Rule and Relief). The uFilter method revealed competitive and appealing cost-effectiveness results on selecting relevant features, as a support tool for breast cancer CADx methods especially in unbalanced datasets contexts. Finally, the redundancy analysis as a complementary step to the uFilter method provided us an effective way for finding optimal subsets of features without decreasing the classification performances.

The aim of this study is to propose a genetic programming (GP) based new ensemble system(named GPES), which can be used to effectively classify different types of cancers. Decision trees are deployed as base classifiers in this ensemble framework with three operators: Min, Max, and Average. Each individual of the GP is an ensemble system, and they become more and more accurate in the evolutionary process. The feature selection technique and balanced subsampling technique are applied to increase the diversity in each ensemble system. The final ensemble committee is selected by a forward search algorithm, which is shown to be capable of fitting data automatically. The performance of GPES is evaluated using five binary class and six multiclass microarray datasets, and results show that the algorithm can achieve better results in most cases compared with some other ensemble systems. By using elaborate base classifiers or applying other sampling techniques, the performance of GPES may be further improved.

In this paper, we employ the firefly algorithm to train all parameters of the SVM simultaneously, including the penalty parameter, smoothness parameter, and Lagrangian multiplier. The proposed method is called the firefly-based SVM (firefly-SVM). This tool is not considered the feature selection, because the SVM, together with feature selection, is not suitable for the application in a multiclass classification, especially for the one-against-all multiclass SVM. In experiments, binary and multiclass classifications are explored. In the experiments on binary classification, ten of the benchmark data sets of the University of California, Irvine (UCI), machine learning repository are used; additionally the firefly-SVM is applied to the multiclass diagnosis of ultrasonic supraspinatus images. The classification performance of firefly-SVM is also compared to the original LIBSVM method associated with the grid search method and the particle swarm optimization based SVM (PSO-SVM). The experimental results advocate the use of firefly-SVM to classify pattern classifications for maximum accuracy.

How to effectively incorporate new annotated data into the learning step is crucial for enhancing the performance of a bioinformatics prediction model. Although machine-learning-based methods have been extensively used for dealing with various biological problems, existing approaches usually train static prediction models based on fixed training datasets. The static approaches are found having several disadvantages such as low scalability and impractical when training dataset is huge. In view of this, we propose a dynamic learning framework for constructing query-driven prediction models. The key difference between the proposed framework and the existing approaches is that the training set for the machine learning algorithm of the proposed framework is dynamically generated according to the query input, as opposed to training a general model regardless of queries in traditional static methods. Accordingly, a query-driven predictor based on the smaller set of data specifically selected from the entire annotated base dataset will be applied on the query. The new way for constructing the dynamic model enables us capable of updating the annotated base dataset flexibly and using the most relevant core subset as the training set makes the constructed model having better generalization ability on the query, showing "part could be better than all" phenomenon. According to the new framework, we have implemented a dynamic protein-ligand binding sites predictor called OSML (On-site model for ligand binding sites prediction). Computer experiments on 10 different ligand types of three hierarchically organized levels show that OSML outperforms most existing predictors. The results indicate that the current dynamic framework is a promising future direction for bridging the gap between the rapidly accumulated annotated biological data and the effective machine-learning-based predictors.

The main goal of this paper is to perform a comparative study of seven well known no-reference learning-based image quality algorithms. To test the performance of these algorithms, three public databases are used. As a first step, the trial algorithms are compared when no new learning is performed. The second step investigates how the training set influences the results. The Spearman Rank Ordered Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) is utilized to measure and compare the performance. In addition, an hypothesis test is conducted to evaluate the statistical significance of performance of each tested algorithm.

Fading occurs when the cartridge is depleted. ISO/IEC 19798:2007(E) specifies a process for determining the cartridge page yield for a given color electro-photographic printer model. It is based on repeatedly printing a suite of test pages, followed by visual examination of the sequence of printed diagnostic pages. But this method is a very costly process since it involves visual examination of a large number of pages. And also the final decision is based on the visual examination of a specially designed diagnostic page, which is different than typical office document pages, since it consists of color bars, and contains no text. In this paper, we propose a new method to autonomously detect the text fading in prints from home or office color printers using a typical office document page instead of a specially designed diagnostic page. In our method, we scan and analyze the printed pages to predict where expert observers would judge fading to have occurred in the print sequence. Our approach is based on a machine-learning framework in which features derived from image analysis are mapped to a fade point prediction.

Controlling misses and false alarms in a machine learning framework for predicting uniformity of printed pages	IMAGE QUALITY AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE XII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Quality and System Performance XII	FEB 10-12, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		Misses; False Alarms; Uniformity; Nonuiformity; Support Vector Machine; Receiver Operating Characteristic	SUPPORT; CLASSIFICATION	In our previous work(1), we presented a block-based technique to analyze printed page uniformity both visually and metrically. The features learned from the models were then employed in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework to classify the pages into one of the two categories of acceptable and unacceptable quality. In this paper, we introduce a set of tools for machine learning in the assessment of printed page uniformity. This work is primarily targeted to the printing industry, specifically the ubiquitous laser, electrophotographic printer. We use features that are well-correlated with the rankings of expert observers to develop a novel machine learning framework that allows one to achieve the minimum "false alarm" rate, subject to a chosen "miss" rate. Surprisingly, most of the research that has been conducted on machine learning does not consider this framework. During the process of developing a new product, test engineers will print hundreds of test pages, which can be scanned and then analyzed by an autonomous algorithm. Among these pages, most may be of acceptable quality. The objective is to find the ones that are not. These will provide critically important information to systems designers, regarding issues that need to be addressed in improving the printer design. A "miss" is defined to be a page that is not of acceptable quality to an expert observer that the prediction algorithm declares to be a "pass". Misses are a serious problem, since they represent problems that will not be seen by the systems designers. On the other hand, "false alarms" correspond to pages that an expert observer would declare to be of acceptable quality, but which are flagged by the prediction algorithm as "fails". In a typical printer testing and development scenario, such pages would be examined by an expert, and found to be of acceptable quality after all. "False alarm" pages result in extra pages to be examined by expert observers, which increases labor cost. But "false alarms" are not nearly as catastrophic as "misses", which represent potentially serious problems that are never seen by the systems developers. This scenario motivates us to develop a machine learning framework that will achieve the minimum "false alarm" rate subject to a specified "miss" rate. In order to construct such a set of receiver operating characteristic(2) (ROC) curves, we examine various tools for the prediction, ranging from an exhaustive search over the space of the nonlinear discriminants to a Cost-Sentitive SVM3 framework. We then compare the curves gained from those methods. Our work shows promise for applying a standard framework to obtain a full ROC curve when it comes to tackling other machine learning problems in industry.

Human observation is slow and subjective, it also requires strict environment setup for the psychological test 1. Thus developing algorithms to match desired human experiments is always in need. Many studies have focused on detecting the fading phenomenon after the materials are printed, that is to monitor the persistence of the color ink 2-4. However, fading is also a common artifact produced by printing systems when the cartridges run low. We want to develop an automatic system to monitor cartridge life and report fading defects when they appear. In this paper, we first describe a psychological experiment that studies the human perspective on printed fading pages. Then we propose an algorithm based on Color Space Projection and Kmeans clustering to predict the visibility of fading defects. At last, we integrate the psychological experiment result with our algorithm to give a machine learning tool that monitors cartridge life.

A machine learning classification is affected by the quality and recency of the training dataset used. Hence, to classify P2P traffic on-line requires the removal of these limitations. In this paper, an automated training dataset generation for an on-line P2P traffic classification is proposed to allow frequent classifier retraining. A two-stage training dataset generator (TSTDG) is proposed by combining a 3-class heuristic and a 3-class statistical classification to automatically generate a training dataset. In the heuristic stage, traffic is classified as P2P, non-P2P, or unknown. In the statistical stage, a dual Decision Tree is built based on a dataset generated in the heuristic stage to reduce the amount of classified unknown traffic. The final training dataset is generated based on all flows that are classified in these two stages. The proposed system has been evaluated on traces captured from a campus network. The overall results show that the TSTDG can generate an accurate training dataset by classifying around 94 % of total flows with high accuracy (98.59 %) and a low false positive rate (1.27 %).

It is a paradox that often the more severe a person's motor impairment, the more challenging it is for them to operate the very assistive machines which might enhance their quality of life. A primary aim of my lab is to address this confound by incorporating robotics autonomy and intelligence into assistive machines-turning the machine into a kind of robot, and offloading some of the control burden from the user. Robots already synthetically sense, act in and reason about the world, and these technologies can be leveraged to help bridge the gap left by sensory, motor or cognitive impairments in the users of assistive machines. This paper overviews some of the ongoing projects in my lab, which strives to advance human ability through robotics autonomy.

In this study, in silico models were developed for the prediction of chemical aquatic toxicity in different fish species. Firstly, a large data set containing 6422 data points on aquatic toxicity with 1906 diverse chemicals was constructed. Using molecular descriptors and fingerprints to represent the molecules, local and global models were then developed with five machine learning methods based on three fish species (rainbow trout, fathead minnow and bluegill sunfish). For the local models, both binary and ternary classification models were obtained for each of the three fish species. For the global models, data of all the three fish species were used together. The predictive accuracy of both the local and global models was around 0.8 for the test sets. Moreover, data of the sheepshead minnow were used as an external validation set. For the best local model (model 2), the predictive accuracy was 0.875 for the sheepshead minnow, while for the best global model (model 14), the predictive accuracy was 0.872 for the sheepshead minnow. The FN compounds in model 2 and model 14 were 18 and 10, respectively. Hence, model 14 was the best model, and thus could predict the toxicity of other fish species'. Furthermore, information gain and ChemoTyper methods were used to identify toxic substructures, which could significantly correlate with chemical aquatic toxicity. This study provides critical tools for an early evaluation of chemical aquatic toxicity in an environmental hazard assessment.

New technologies are enabling the detection, transmission, and storage of data of hitherto unimaginable quantity and quality across the electromagnetic, gravity and particle spectra. The observational data obtained during this decade alone will supersede everything accumulated over the preceding four thousand years of astronomy. Currently there are 4 large-scale photometric and spectroscopic surveys underway, each generating and/or utilizing hundreds of terabytes of data per year. Some will focus on the static universe while others will greatly expand our knowledge of transient phenomena. Maximizing the science from these programs requires integrating the processing pipeline with high-performance computing resources. These are coupled to large astrophysics databases while making use of machine learning algorithms with near real-time turnaround. Here we present an overview of one of these programs, the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We will cover the processing and discovery pipeline we developed at LBNL and NERSC for it and several of the great discoveries made during the 4 years of observations with PTF.

To this end, we utilize the framework of persuasion games-a branch of game theory that deals with asymmetric interactions where one player (Sender) possesses more information about the world, but it is only the other player (Receiver) who can take an action. In particular, we use an extended persuasion model, where the Sender's information is imperfect and the Receiver has more than two alternative actions available. We design a computational algorithm that, from the Sender's standpoint, calculates the optimal information disclosure rule. The algorithm is parameterized by the Receiver's decision model (i.e., what choice he will make based on the information disclosed by the Sender) and can be retuned accordingly. We then provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithm's performance in interactions with human Receivers. First, we consider a fully rational (in the Bayesian sense) Receiver decision model and experimentally show the efficacy of the resulting Sender's solution in a routing domain. Despite the discrepancy in the Sender's and the Receiver's utilities from each of the Receiver's choices, our Sender agent successfully persuaded human Receivers to select an option more beneficial for the agent. Dropping the Receiver's rationality assumption, we introduce a machine learning procedure that generates a more realistic human Receiver model. We then show its significant benefit to the Sender solution by repeating our routing experiment. To complete our study, we introduce a second (supply-demand) experimental domain and, by contrasting it with the routing domain, obtain general guidelines for a Sender on how to construct a Receiver model.

To this end, identifying colocalization patterns between Raman spectral images and fluorescence microscopic images is a key step to annotate subcellular components in Raman spectroscopic images. While existing approaches to resolve subcellular structures are based on fluorescence labeling, we propose a combination of a colocalization scheme with subsequent training of a supervised classifier that allows label-free resolution of cellular compartments. Our colocalization scheme unveils statistically significant overlapping regions by identifying correlation between the fluorescence color channels and clusters from unsupervised machine learning methods like hierarchical cluster analysis. The colocalization scheme is used as a pre-selection to gather appropriate spectra as training data. These spectra are used in the second part as training data to establish a supervised random forest classifier to automatically identify lipid droplets and nucleus. We validate our approach by examining Raman spectral images overlaid with fluorescence labelings of different cellular compartments, indicating that specific components may indeed be identified label-free in the spectral image.

These systems are trained to classify the EEG based on the ground truth provided by the neurologists. So, there should be a mechanism in these systems, using which a system's incorrect markings can be mentioned and the system should improve its classification by learning from them. We have developed a simple mechanism for neurologists to improve classification rate while encountering any false classification. This system is based on taking discrete wavelet transform(DWT) of the signals epochs which are then reduced using principal component analysis, and then they are fed into a classifier. After discussing our approach, we have shown the classification performance of three types of classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), quadratic discriminant analysis, and artificial neural network. We found SVM to be the best working classifier. Our work exhibits the importance and viability of a self-improving and user adapting computer-assisted EEG analysis system for diagnosing epilepsy which processes each channel exclusive to each other, along with the performance comparison of different machine learning techniques in the suggested system.

All motor-driven machinery used in the modern world can develop faults. The maintenance plans include analyzing the external relevant information of critical components, in order to evaluate its internal state. From the beginning of the twentieth century, different technologies have been used to process signals of dynamical systems. Design/methodology/approach - A proposed neural network (NN) is also employed to predict vibration parameters of the experimental test rig. Moreover, four types of oils are used for gearbox to predict reliable oil. Vibration signals extracted from rotating parts of machineries carry lot many information within them about the condition of the operating machine. Further processing of these raw vibration signatures measured at a convenient location of the machine unravels the condition of the component or the assembly under study. The experimental stand for testing an unloaded gearbox is composed by actuated direct current (DC) driving system. Findings - This paper deals with the effectiveness of wavelet-based features for fault diagnosis of a gearbox using two types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and stress analyzed with computer-based software ANNs. The results improved that the proposed NN has superior performance to adapt experimental results. Practical implications - This paper is one such attempt to apply machine learning methods like ANN. This work deals with extraction of wavelet features from the vibration data of a gearbox system and classification of gear faults using ANNs. Originality/value - These kind of NN-based approaches are novel approaches to predict real-time vibration and acceleration parameters of unloaded gearbox with five types of oils. Also, the investigation contains new information about studied process, containing elements of novelty.

Automatic Identification of Reticular Pseudodrusen Using Multimodal Retinal Image Analysis	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						reticular pseudodrusen; automatic detection; age-related macular degeneration	SUBRETINAL DRUSENOID DEPOSITS; AGE-RELATED MACULOPATHY; MACULAR DEGENERATION; GEOGRAPHIC-ATROPHY; FELLOW-EYES; RISK-FACTOR; QUANTIFICATION; DISEASE; FUNDUS; AUTOFLUORESCENCE	PURPOSE. To examine human performance and agreement on reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) detection and quantification by using single-and multimodality grading protocols and to describe and evaluate a machine learning system for the automatic detection and quantification of reticular pseudodrusen by using single-and multimodality information. METHODS. Color fundus, fundus autofluoresence, and near-infrared images of 278 eyes from 230 patients with or without presence of RPD were used in this study. All eyes were scored for presence of RPD during single-and multimodality setups by two experienced observers and a developed machine learning system. Furthermore, automatic quantification of RPD area was performed by the proposed system and compared with human delineations. RESULTS. Observers obtained a higher performance and better interobserver agreement for RPD detection with multimodality grading, achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.940 and 0.958, and a k agreement of 0.911. The proposed automatic system achieved an area under the ROC of 0.941 with a multimodality setup. Automatic RPD quantification resulted in an intraclass correlation (ICC) value of 0.704, which was comparable with ICC values obtained between single-modality manual delineations. CONCLUSIONS. Observer performance and agreement for RPD identification improved significantly by using a multimodality grading approach. The developed automatic system showed similar performance as observers, and automatic RPD area quantification was in concordance with manual delineations. The proposed automatic system allows for a fast and accurate identification and quantification of RPD, opening the way for efficient quantitative imaging biomarkers in large data set analysis.

In this paper, a local energy-based framework is proposed to estimate the features' relevance for ranking them. The key idea behind this framework is to transform a complex nonlinear problem into a set of locally linear ones through local energy-based learning. Moreover, the convergence of this framework is analyzed. Some experiments are conducted on benchmark data sets including high dimension small sample size data, such as gene data. The experimental results have shown the correctness of our algorithm derived from this framework and its performance is higher or similar to other classical feature ranking algorithms in most cases.

Accurate lithography hotspot detection based on principal component analysis-support vector machine classifier with hierarchical data clustering	JOURNAL OF MICRO-NANOLITHOGRAPHY MEMS AND MOEMS			English	Article						lithography hotspot detection; machine learning; principal component analysis	OPC	As technology nodes continue to shrink, layout patterns become more sensitive to lithography processes, resulting in lithography hotspots that need to be identified and eliminated during physical verification. We propose an accurate hotspot detection approach based on principal component analysis-support vector machine classifier. Several techniques, including hierarchical data clustering, data balancing, and multilevel training, are provided to enhance the performance of the proposed approach. Our approach is accurate and more efficient than conventional time-consuming lithography simulation and provides a high flexibility for adapting to new lithography processes and rules.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most effective machine learning methods used in this field. The performance of SVM-based methods depends on the vector representations of RNAs. However, the discriminative power of the existing feature vectors is limited, and many methods lack an interpretable model for analysis of characteristic sequence features. Prior studies have demonstrated that sequence or structure order effects were relevant for discrimination, but little work has explored how to use this kind of information for human pre-microRNA identification. In this study, in order to incorporate the structure-order information into the prediction, a method called "miRNA-dis'' was proposed, in which the feature vector was constructed by the occurrence frequency of the "distance structure status pair'' or just the "distance-pair''. Rigorous cross-validations on a much larger and more stringent newly constructed benchmark dataset showed that the miRNA-dis outperformed some state-of-the-art predictors in this area. Remarkably, miRNA-dis trained with human data can correctly predict 87.02% of the 4022 pre-miRNAs from 11 different species ranging from animals, plants and viruses. miRNA-dis would be a useful high throughput tool for large-scale analysis of microRNA precursors. In addition, the learnt model can be easily analyzed in terms of discriminative features, and some interesting patterns were discovered, which could reflect the characteristics of microRNAs. A user-friendly web-server of miRNA-dis was constructed, which is freely accessible to the public at the web-site on http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/miRNA-dis/.

Muskellunge Spawning Site Selection in Northern Wisconsin Lakes and a GIS-Based Predictive Habitat Model	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; MAXIMUM-ENTROPY; NEW-YORK; MAXENT; RIVER; PIKE; PERFORMANCE; REEFS; SIZE	Spawning habitat degradation has been linked to declines in naturally reproducing Muskellunge Esox masquinongy populations, and managers require efficient methods to identify and protect these habitats. We collected spawning habitat data from 28 lakes in northern Wisconsin to determine Muskellunge spawning habitat selection and to create a GIS-based model for predicting the locations of spawning sites. Spawning site selection by Muskellunge may be more complex than previously thought. Muskellunge showed selection for spawning in habitats with a sheltered effective fetch and east-facing shorelines. The strongest selection was for habitats with a combination of moderate slope, small flats, and concave bathymetric curvature. Muskellunge selected against steeply sloping shorelines; very large areas of shallow flats; developed shorelines; herbaceous wetlands; and complex-leafed submersed aquatic vegetation. Lake trophic status appears to interact with other habit variables to determine spawning site selection; sites without submersed aquatic vegetation were more strongly selected in eutrophic lakes than in other lake types. A GIS model of spawning site selection was created using the machine learning program MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Modeling). The model predicted that Muskellunge would spawn in areas with moderately sheltered effective fetches, moderate to small areas of shallow flats, away from outflowing streams, and (to a lesser extent) along shorelines facing east or west. The model was tested on novel lakes using area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis, in which values ranged from 0.5 (predictions no better than random) to 1.0 (perfect assignment). The mean AUC(test) value (i.e., the expectation of model performance for a novel lake) was 0.637 (SD = 0.12). When the model was used to designate the best 20% of available spawning habitat area for Muskellunge in each lake (based on the relative probability of spawning), that area contained 32% of the spawning sites. The model provides an efficient method for management agencies and conservation groups to use in designating spawning habitat for conservation and in communicating with the public through spawning habitat maps.

They provide a valuable source for indexing and interpretation of video data. Text detection and recognition task in images or videos typically distinguished between overlay and scene text. Overlay text is artificially superimposed on the image at the time of editing and scene text is text captured by the recording system. Typically, OCR systems are specialized on one kind of text type. However, in video images both types of text can be found. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically distinguish between overlay and scene text to dynamically control and optimize post processing steps following text detection. Based on a feature combination a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained to classify scene and overlay text. We show how this distinction in overlay and scene text improves the word recognition rate.

The images taken by digital cameras generally provide less information than multi-channel remote sensing images. Moreover, the application-dependent insignificant changes, such as shadows or clouds, may cause the failure of the classical methods based on image differences. The machine learning approach seems to be promising, but the lack of a sufficient volume of training data for photographic landscape observatories discards a lot of methods. So we investigate in this work the interactive learning approach and provide a discriminative model that is a 16-dimensional feature space comprising the textural appearance and contextual information. Dissimilarity measures in different neighborhood sizes are used to detect the difference within the neighborhood of an image pair. To detect changes between two images, the user designates change and non-change samples (pixel sets) in the images using a selection tool. This data is used to train a classifier using decision tree training method which is then applied to all the other pixels of the image pair. The experiments have proved the potential of the proposed approach.

In particular we study such representations for results of conjunctive queries. We derive tight asymptotic bounds for representation sizes and present algorithms to compute representations within these bounds. We compare the succinctness of f-representations and d-representations for results of equi-join queries, and relate them to fractional edge covers and fractional hypertree decompositions of the query hypergraph. Recent work showed that f-representations can significantly boost the performance of query evaluation in centralised and distributed settings and of machine learning tasks.

As a result, while the body of NIAD research has grown extensively, knowledge of the utility of similarity and distance measures within the field has not grown correspondingly. NIAD research covers a myriad of domains and employs a diverse array of techniques from simple k-means clustering through advanced multiagent distributed AD systems. This review presents an overview of the use of similarity and distance measures within NIAD research. The analysis provides a theoretical background in distance measures and a discussion of various types of distance measures and their uses. Exemplary uses of distance measures in published research are presented, as is the overall state of the distance measure rigor in the field. Finally, areas that require further focus on improving the distance measure rigor in the NIAD field are presented.

Obviously, this effort requires a deep understanding of the intrinsic properties of interaction. Up to now, many researchers have focused on inferring human intents in terms of intermediate or terminal goals in physical tasks. On the other hand, working side by side with people, an autonomous robot additionally needs to come up with in-depth information about underlying haptic interaction patterns that are typically encountered during human-human cooperation. However, to our knowledge, no study has yet focused on characterizing such detailed information. In this sense, this work is pioneering as an effort to gain deeper understanding of interaction patterns involving two or more humans in a physical task. We present a labeled human-human-interaction dataset, which captures the interaction of two humans, who collaboratively transport an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment. In the light of information gained by studying this dataset, we propose that the actions of cooperating partners can be examined under three interaction types: In any cooperative task, the interacting humans either 1) work in harmony, 2) cope with conflicts, or 3) remain passive during interaction. In line with this conception, we present a taxonomy of human interaction patterns; then propose five different feature sets, comprising force-, velocity-and power-related information, for the classification of these patterns. Our evaluation shows that using a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we can accomplish a correct classification rate of 86 percent for the identification of interaction patterns, an accuracy obtained by fusing a selected set of most informative features by Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method.

The database is a publicly available resource that aims to support research on advanced myoelectric hand prostheses. The database is obtained by jointly recording surface electromyography signals from the forearm and kinematics of the hand and wrist while subjects perform a predefined set of actions and postures. Besides describing the acquisition protocol, overall features of the datasets and the processing procedures in detail, we present benchmark classification results using a variety of feature representations and classifiers. Our comparison shows that simple feature representations such as mean absolute value and waveform length can achieve similar performance to the computationally more demanding marginal discrete wavelet transform. With respect to classification methods, the nonlinear support vector machine was found to be the only method consistently achieving high performance regardless of the type of feature representation. Furthermore, statistical analysis of these results shows that classification accuracy is negatively correlated with the subject's Body Mass Index. The analysis and the results described in this paper aim to be a strong baseline for the NINAPRO database. Thanks to the NINAPRO database (and the characterization described in this paper), the scientific community has the opportunity to converge to a common position on hand movement recognition by surface electromyography, a field capable to strongly affect hand prosthesis capabilities.

J	Abu Hammad, A; El-Halees, A				Abu Hammad, Ahmed; El-Halees, Alaa			All Approach for Detecting Spain in Arabic Opinion Reviews	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						Opinion mining; arabic opinion mining; spam review; spam detection		For the rapidly increasing amount of information available on the Internet, little quality control exists, especially over the user-generated content. Manually scanning through large amounts of user-generated content is time-consuming and sometime impossible. In this case, opinion mining is a better alternative. Although, it is recognized that the opinion reviews contain valuable information for a variety of applications, the lack of quality control attracts spammers who have found many ways to draw their benefits from spamming. Moreover, the spam detection problem is complex because spammers always invent fresh methods that can't be easily recognized. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new approach that works to identify spam in opinion reviews. We have some in English; we need one in Arabic language in order to identify Arabic spam reviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no published study to detect spam in Arabic reviews. In this research, we propose a new approach for performing spam detection in Arabic opinion reviews by merging methods from data mining and text mining in one mining classification approach. Our work is based on the state-of-the-art achievements in the Latin-based spam detection techniques keeping in mind the specific nature of the Arabic language. In addition; we overcome the drawbacks of the class imbalance problem by using sampling techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in identifying Arabic spam opinion reviews. Our designed machine learning achieves significant improvements. In the best case, our F-measure is improved to 99.59%.

The basic idea lies in the mapping of an input space into a feature space via inverse covariance Sigma(1) factorization and then computing the principal components in the extracted feature space. The performance of the proposed method has been shown quantitatively and qualitatively on a well known the Essex University's image database. The comparison shows that the proposed method outperforms competing Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) method (classical Principal Component Analysis) in variance coverage as well as in the execution time.

Characteristics recognition is one of the primary image processing operations, which means it is the first operation of the processing of an image. Delete an occluded area from the image. There are two kinds of existing methods: one method is to manually remove the obstructions to be a uniform color fill or outline its contours, another way is to use the shortest path algorithm or the expansion of biology technique to extract optimal edges. In this paper, to solve the complex background images and the characteristics extraction error because of mutual occlusion, the partial characteristics extraction algorithm is proposed. Partial characteristics are extracted by deep analysis of the texture features, shape local features, and combined with the overall characteristics of the morphology, structure, etc. And achieve images efficient and fast retrieval.

The algorithm contains three major processes, including prior collecting, statistical models building, and shape detecting. In prior collecting, based on benchmark of liver segmentation, the prior information about the liver is collected, including its position, pose, shape, texture, and the statistical intensity distribution of surrounding area. To fully utilise the prior information for segmentation, the statistical models building will build a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and the three statistical models.

In the data analysis, one typically calculates the mean squared displacements to obtain the self-diffusion coefficients. Further information extraction for each individual atom poses significant challenges due to the lack of general methods. In this work, oxygen ion diffusion in A-site ordered perovskite PrBaCo2O5.5 is studied using MD simulations and the oxygen migration is analyzed by k-means clustering, a machine learning algorithm. The clustering analysis allows the tracking of each individual oxygen jump along with its corresponding location, i.e., oxygen site in BaO, PrO0.5 and CoO2 layers. Therefore it increases the understanding of the factors influencing oxygen diffusion. For example, it is found that the oxygen occupation fraction in the PrO0.5 layers increases with temperature, while in the CoO2 layers it decreases with temperature. Additionally, the activation enthalpies of oxygen jumps from CoO2 to CoO2, CoO2 to PrO0.5 and PrO0.5 to CoO2 are 0.22 eV, 0.54 eV and 0.34 eV, respectively, exhibiting anisotropic characteristics. Furthermore, the dwell times of oxygen atoms suggest that they are highly mobile in PrO0.5 layers. Combining the analysis of activation enthalpies and dwell times, it is suggested that the oxygen transport is fast within the CoO2 layers while the PrO0.5 layers work as oxygen vacancy reservoirs.

J	Huang, CH; Peng, HS; Ng, KL				Huang, Chien-Hung; Peng, Huai-Shun; Ng, Ka-Lok			Prediction of Cancer Proteins by Integrating Protein Interaction, Domain Frequency, and Domain Interaction Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CELL LUNG-CANCER; IN-SILICO IDENTIFICATION; TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES; INTERACTION NETWORKS; DISEASE-GENES; DATA SETS; KINASE; COMPLEXES; CARCINOMA; UPDATE	Many proteins are known to be associated with cancer diseases. It is quite often that their precise functional role in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. A strategy to gain a better understanding of the function of these proteins is to make use of a combination of different aspects of proteomics data types. In this study, we extended Aragues's method by employing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, domain-domain interaction (DDI) data, weighted domain frequency score (DFS), and cancer linker degree (CLD) data to predict cancer proteins. Performances were benchmarked based on three kinds of experiments as follows: (I) using individual algorithm, (II) combining algorithms, and (III) combining the same classification types of algorithms. When compared with Aragues's method, our proposed methods, that is, machine learning algorithm and voting with the majority, are significantly superior in all seven performance measures. We demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed method on two independent datasets. The best algorithm can achieve a hit ratio of 89.4% and 72.8% for lung cancer dataset and lung cancer microarray study, respectively. It is anticipated that the current research could help understand disease mechanisms and diagnosis.

Different data mining techniques have been used for mining rules, and mathematical models have been developed to assist the clinician in decision making. The objective of this research is to build a classifier that will predict the presence or absence of a disease by learning from the minimal set of attributes that has been extracted from the clinical dataset. In this work rough set indiscernibility relation method with backpropagation neural network (RS-BPNN) is used. This work has two stages. The first stage is handling of missing values to obtain a smooth data set and selection of appropriate attributes from the clinical dataset by indiscernibility relation method. The second stage is classification using backpropagation neural network on the selected reducts of the dataset. The classifier has been tested with hepatitis, Wisconsin breast cancer, and Statlog heart disease datasets obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The accuracy obtained from the proposed method is 97.3%, 98.6%, and 90.4% for hepatitis, breast cancer, and heart disease, respectively. The proposed system provides an effective classification model for clinical datasets.

Uncovering the PPIs and their function within the cell is a challenge of post-genomic biology and will improve our understanding of disease and help in the development of novel methods for disease diagnosis and forensics. The experimental methods currently used to identify PPIs are both time-consuming and expensive, and high throughput experimental results have shown both high false positive beside false negative information for protein interaction. These obstacles could be overcome by developing computational approaches to predict PPIs and validate the obtained experimental results. In this work, we will describe the recent advances in predicting protein-protein interaction from the following aspects: i) the benchmark dataset construction, ii) the sequence representation approaches, iii) the common machine learning algorithms, and iv) the cross-validation test methods and assessment metrics.

Protein contact map is proved to be crucial in forming the three-dimensional structure. Contact map prediction has now become an indispensable and promising intermediate step towards final three-dimensional structure prediction, while directed sequence-structure prediction hits its bottlenecks. In this article, different evaluation scores of prediction efficiency are compared. Next, the state of the art and future perspectives of contact map methods are reviewed and special attention is paid to those relying on machine learning algorithms. Details of neural network based methods as well as a list of machine learning based methods are given. Finally, bottlenecks and potential improvements of contact map predictions are discussed.

We give implications and equivalences relating RBM-representable probability distributions, perfectly reconstructible inputs, Hamming modes, zonotopes and zonosets, point configurations in hyperplane arrangements, linear threshold codes, and multicovering numbers of hypercubes. As a motivating application, we prove results on the relative representational power of mixtures of product distributions and products of mixtures of pairs of product distributions (RBMs) that formally justify widely held intuitions about distributed representations. In particular, we show that a mixture of products requiring an exponentially larger number of parameters is needed to represent the probability distributions which can be obtained as products of mixtures.

In this paper, we show the equivalence between mirror descent algorithms and algorithms generalizing the conditional gradient method. This is done through convex duality and implies notably that for certain problems, such as for supervised machine learning problems with nonsmooth losses or problems regularized by nonsmooth regularizers, the primal subgradient method and the dual conditional gradient method are formally equivalent. The dual interpretation leads to a form of line search for mirror descent, as well as guarantees of convergence for primal-dual certificates.

The best representation often needs to minimize a distance function of the data on a sphere as well as to satisfy some Euclidean distance constraints. It is those spherical and Euclidean distance constraints that present an enormous challenge to the existing algorithms. In this paper, we reformulate the problem as an Euclidean distance matrix optimization problem with a low rank constraint. We then propose an iterative algorithm that uses a quadratically convergent Newton-CG method at each step. We study fundamental issues including constraint nondegeneracy and the nonsingularity of generalized Jacobian that ensure the quadratic convergence of the Newton method. We use some classic examples from the spherical multidimensional scaling to demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm in incorporating various constraints. We also present an interesting application to the circle fitting problem.

Automatic Segmentation of Colon in 3D CT Images and Removal of Opacified Fluid Using Cascade Feed Forward Neural Network	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							VALIDATION; ALGORITHM	Purpose. Colon segmentation is an essential step in the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems based on computed tomography (CT) images. The requirement for the detection of the polyps which lie on the walls of the colon is much needed in the field of medical imaging for diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Methods. The proposed work is focused on designing an efficient automatic colon segmentation algorithm from abdominal slices consisting of colons, partial volume effect, bowels, and lungs. The challenge lies in determining the exact colon enhanced with partial volume effect of the slice. In this work, adaptive thresholding technique is proposed for the segmentation of air packets, machine learning based cascade feed forward neural network enhanced with boundary detection algorithms are used which differentiate the segments of the lung and the fluids which are sediment at the side wall of colon and by rejecting bowels based on the slice difference removal method. The proposed neural network method is trained with Bayesian regulation algorithm to determine the partial volume effect. Results. Experiment was conducted on CT database images which results in 98% accuracy and minimal error rate. Conclusions.

Visual detection of such parasite through microscopic inspection is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we provide an AdaBoost learning solution to the task of Chagas parasite detection in blood images. We give details of the algorithm and our experimental setup. With this method, we get 100% and 93.25% of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. A ROC comparison with the method most commonly used for the detection of malaria parasites based on support vector machines (SVM) is also provided. Our experimental work shows mainly two things: (1) Chagas parasites can be detected automatically using machine learning methods with high accuracy and (2) AdaBoost + SVM provides better overall detection performance than AdaBoost or SVMs alone. Such results are the best ones known so far for the problem of automatic detection of Chagas parasites through the use of machine learning, computer vision, and image processing methods.

Currently, several in silico methods have been developed for the prediction of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) using artificial neural network (ANN) or support vector machine (SVM). In spite of this, there are ample opportunities for further improvements by developing a simple and interpretable quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method. Herein, an efficient linear method (ELM) is proposed for constructing a highly predictive QSAR model containing a spontaneous feature importance estimator. Briefly, ELM is a linear-based model with optimal parameters derived from genetic algorithm. Results showed that the simple ELM method displayed robust performance with 10-fold cross-validation MCC values of 0.64 and 0.56 for steroidal and non-steroidal AIs, respectively. Comparative analyses with other machine learning methods (i.e. ANN, SVM and decision tree) were also performed. A thorough analysis of informative molecular descriptors for both steroidal and non-steroidal AIs provided insights into the mechanism of action of compounds. Our findings suggest that the shape and polarizability of compounds may govern the inhibitory activity of both steroidal and non-steroidal types whereas the terminal primary C(sp3) functional group and electronegativity may be required for non-steroidal AIs. The R code of the ELM method is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1274030.

The ability of accurately predicting the area that may be involved in a forest fire event may help in optimizing fire management efforts. Given the complexity of the task, powerful computational tools are needed for predicting the amount of area that will be burned during a forest fire. The purpose of this study was to develop an intelligent system based on genetic programming for the prediction of burned areas, using only data related to the forest under analysis and meteorological data. We used geometric semantic genetic programming based on recently defined geometric semantic genetic operators for genetic programming. Experimental results, achieved using a database of 517 forest fire events between 2000 and 2003, showed the appropriateness of the proposed system for the prediction of the burned areas. In particular, results obtained with geometric semantic genetic programming were significantly better than those produced by standard genetic programming and other state of the art machine learning methods on both training and out-of-sample data. This study suggests that deeper investigation of genetic programming in the field of forest fires prediction may be productive.

These inference systems are used for the systematic classification of the best candidates for inclusion in bacterial metabolic pathway maps. This meta-learner-based approach utilises a workflow where the user provides feedback with final classification decisions which are stored in conjunction with analysed genetic sequences for periodic inference system training. The inference systems were trained and tested with three different data sets related to the bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds. The analysis of the meta-learner-based framework involved contrasting several different optimisation methods with various different parameters. The obtained inference systems were also contrasted with other standard classification methods with accurate prediction capabilities observed.

In the study we used a dataset consisting of 348 consecutive breast masses that underwent image guided core biopsy performed between October 2005 and December 2007 on 328 female subjects. We applied various algorithms with parameter variation to learn from the data. The tasks were to predict mass density and to predict malignancy. The best classifier that predicts mass density is based on a support vector machine and has accuracy of 81.3%. The expert correctly annotated 70% of the mass densities. The best classifier that predicts malignancy is also based on a support vector machine and has accuracy of 85.6%, with a positive predictive value of 85%. One important contribution of this work is that our model can predict malignancy in the absence of the mass density attribute, since we can fill up this attribute using our mass density predictor.

To achieve this purpose, a two objective optimisation model is set up for prototype selection problem in the paper. To make the model be solved easier, it is transformed to a single objective optimisation model by the division of the two objectives, and a new two-layer genetic algorithm is proposed by using a divide-and-conquer partition strategy. The divide-and-conquer partition can divide the whole dataset into some random sub-datasets to be handled, respectively. The simulations are conducted and the proposed algorithm is compared with several existing algorithms. The results obtained on UCI static datasets and time series datasets indicate that the proposed algorithm is an expedient method in design nearest neighbour classifiers.

The system is based on the Adaboost M1 machine learning algorithm using a training dataset collected from 20 lectures. The system is implemented in Matlab and is capable of recognizing patterns from the sound (i.e. spectral entropy and formant frequency), images (i.e. descriptors of students' motion) and a 3-axis accelerometer (i.e. lecturers' motion descriptors). A system performance is evaluated by 10-fold cross validation. The total average accuracy during the simulation was 92.2%. After the simulation, the system was implemented and its performance evaluated by comparing a real-time annotator (i.e. the students' feedback) with the system output during live lectures. The average accuracy of the system evaluated for three different groups of students was 81.9%; indicating that there is still room for improvement, but that it can be the basis of a novel approach for detecting the level of interest a lecture creates in a classroom environment.

From almost any type of industrial applications to intelligent vehicles, smart city applications, and healthcare applications, we see a steady growth of the usage of various types of sensors. The rate of increase in the amount of data produced by these sensors is much more dramatic since sensors usually continuously produce data. It becomes crucial for these data to be stored for future reference and to be analyzed for finding valuable information, such as fault diagnosis information. In this paper we describe a scalable and distributed architecture for sensor data collection, storage, and analysis.

The ELM has been proposed as a new learning algorithm for Single-Hidden Layer Feed forward Networks (SLFNs). The ELM structure has several advantageous such as good generalization performance, extremely fast learning ability and low computational process. Besides this advantageous, the ELM structure has some drawbacks. Firstly, the ELM encounters over-fitting problems because of using a least squares minimization in calculation of the output weights. The other drawback is about accuracy of the ELM. It depends on the number of hidden neurons. This situation is a big challenge in high-dimensional problems for some practical applications. In this paper, we propose a sparse ELM model to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks. In the sparse ELM model, Forward-Backward Pursuit (FBP) algorithms based on greedy pursuit was used to obtain sparse representation of the output weights. The proposed method which is called FBP-ELM, has several benefits in comparing with the traditional ELM schemes such as avoiding over-fitting, low computational complexity and with adequate number of neurons in hidden layer. FBP-ELM shows its remarkable advantages when it is compared with the empirical studies on commonly used classification benchmarks. Moreover, a comparison with the original ELM and the other regularized ELM schemes such as Least-angle regression (LARS), Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Elastic Net is presented to show effectiveness of proposed FBP-ELM method.

Besides this issue, the increasing amount of data that is being generated every day by remote sensors raises more challenges to be overcome. In this work, a tool within the scope of InterIMAGE Cloud Platform (ICP), which is an open-source, distributed framework for automatic image interpretation, is presented. The tool, named ICP: Data Mining Package, is able to perform supervised classification procedures on huge amounts of data, usually referred as big data, on a distributed infrastructure using Hadoop MapReduce. The tool has four classification algorithms implemented, taken from WEKA's machine learning library, namely: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results of an experimental analysis using a SVM classifier on data sets of different sizes for different cluster configurations demonstrates the potential of the tool, as well as aspects that affect its performance.

The hyperspectral data consists of 242 bands out of which 196 calibrated/useful bands are available for hyperspectral applications. Atmospheric correction applied to the hyperspectral calibrated bands make the data more useful for its further processing/application. Principal component (PC) analysis applied to the hyperspectral calibrated bands reduced the dimensionality of the data and it is found that 99% of the data is held in first 10 PCs. Feature extraction is one of the important application by using vegetation delineation and normalized difference vegetation index. The machine learning classifiers uses the technique to identify the pixels having significant difference in the spectral signature which is very useful for classification of an image. Supervised machine learning classifier technique has been used for classification of hyperspectral image which resulted in overall efficiency of 86.6703 and Kappa co-efficient of 0.7998.

For reliably extracting objects such as buildings, road inventory or vegetation, many approaches rely on the results of a point cloud classification, where each 3D point is assigned a respective semantic class label. Such an assignment, in turn, typically involves statistical methods for feature extraction and machine learning. Whereas the different components in the processing workflow have extensively, but separately been investigated in recent years, the respective connection by sharing the results of crucial tasks across all components has not yet been addressed. This connection not only encapsulates the interrelated issues of neighborhood selection and feature extraction, but also the issue of how to involve spatial context in the classification step. In this paper, we present a novel and generic approach for 3D scene analysis which relies on (i) individually optimized 3D neighborhoods for (ii) the extraction of distinctive geometric features and (iii) the contextual classification of point cloud data. For a labeled benchmark dataset, we demonstrate the beneficial impact of involving contextual information in the classification process and that using individual 3D neighborhoods of optimal size significantly increases the quality of the results for both pointwise and contextual classification.

This problem is motivated by several applications in which it is required to estimate a function representation from available data. Recently, an extension of hypercircle inequality to data error (Hide) was proposed by Kannika Khompurngson and Charles A. Micchelli and the results on this subject have constructed a new learning method. Unfortunately, the material on Hide only applies to circumstances for which all data are known within error. In this paper, our purpose is to extend the hypercircle inequality to circumstances for which data set contains both accurate and inaccurate data.

Machine learning-based methods have been widely used for DNR with various types of features such as part-of-speech, word shape, and dictionary feature. Features used in current machine learning-based methods are usually singleton features which may be due to explosive features and a large number of noisy features when singleton features are combined into conjunction features. However, singleton features that can only capture one linguistic characteristic of a word are not sufficient to describe the information for DNR when multiple characteristics should be considered. In this study, we explore feature conjunction and feature selection for DNR, which have never been reported. We intuitively select 8 types of singleton features and combine them into conjunction features in two ways. Then, Chi-square, mutual information, and information gain are used to mine effective features. Experimental results show that feature conjunction and feature selection can improve the performance of the DNR system with a moderate number of features and our DNR system significantly outperforms the best system in the DDIExtraction 2013 challenge.

The algorithm learns the deconvolution process. This is achieved by learning the deconvolution filter kernels for the set of learnt basic pixel patterns. The algorithm consists of the offline learning and online filtering stages. In the one-time offline learning stage, the algorithm learns the dictionary of various local characteristics of the pixel patch as the basic pixel patterns from a huge number of natural images in the training database. Later, the deconvolution filter coefficients for each pixel pattern is optimized by using the source and the corrupted image pairs in the training database. In the online stage, the algorithm only needs to find the nearest matching pixel pattern in the dictionary for each pixel and filter it using the filter optimized for the corresponding pixel pattern. Experimental results on natural images show that our method achieves the state-of-art result on an image deblurring. The proposed approach can be applied to recover a sharp image for applications such as camera, HD/UHD TV, document scanning systems etc.	[Mainali, Pradip; Wittebrood, Rimmert] Vis Innovat Site Europe, Ghent, Belgium	Mainali, P (reprint author), Vis Innovat Site Europe, Ghent, Belgium.	pradip.mainali@tpvision.com						21	0	0	SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING	BELLINGHAM	1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA	0277-786X		978-1-62841-491-2	PROC SPIE			2015	9401								940104	10.1117/12.2077458		13	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	Engineering; Optics; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	BC5AJ	WOS:000353126600002

These are challenging problems for image processing because of the variability in object appearance that inevitably arises in real world image acquisition and analysis. One of the most promising (and practical) ways to address these challenges is interactive image segmentation. These algorithms are designed to incorporate input from a human operator to tailor the segmentation method to the image at hand. Interactive image segmentation is now a key tool in a wide range of applications in microscopy and elsewhere. Historically, interactive image segmentation algorithms have tailored segmentation on an image-by-image basis, and information derived from operator input is not transferred between images. But recently there has been increasing interest to use machine learning in segmentation to provide interactive tools that accumulate and learn from the operator input over longer periods of time. These new learning algorithms reduce the need for operator input over time, and can potentially provide a more dynamic balance between customization and automation for different applications. This paper reviews the state of the art in this area, provides a unified view of these algorithms, and compares the segmentation performance of various design choices.

These data, compared with those obtained from previous remote sensing techniques, yield an unprecedented level of detailed spectral resolution in additional to an ever increasing level of spatial information. A major challenge brought about by the data is the burden of processing and interpreting these datasets and extract the relevant information from it. This research aims at approaching the challenge by exploring machine learning methods especially unsupervised learning to achieve cluster density estimation and classification, and ultimately devising an efficient means leading to identification of minerals. A set of software tools have been constructed by Python to access and experiment with CRISM hyperspectral cubes selected from two specific Mars locations. A machine learning pipeline is proposed and unsupervised learning methods were implemented onto pre-processed datasets. The resulting data clusters are compared with the published ASTER spectral library and browse data products from the Planetary Data System (PDS). The result demonstrated that this approach is capable of processing the huge amount of hyperspectral data and potentially providing guidance to scientists for more detailed studies.	[Tse, C.

Machine learning techniques, applied to large databases of photos, mimic with reasonably good accuracy the mean ratings of online viewers. However, owing to the many factors underlying aesthetics, it is likely that such techniques for rating photos do not generalize well beyond the data on which they are trained. This paper reviews recent attempts to compare human ratings, obtained in a controlled setting, to ratings provided by machine learning techniques. We review methods to obtain meaningful ratings both from selected groups of judges and also from crowd sourcing. We find that state-of-the-art techniques for automatic aesthetic evaluation are only weakly correlated with human ratings. This shows the importance of obtaining data used for training automated systems under carefully controlled conditions.

We are developing a system for automated video indexing and in this paper discuss our approach for video segmentation and classification of video segments. The novel contributions in this paper are two fold. First we develop a dynamic Gabor filter and use it to extract features for video frame classification. Second, we propose a recursive video segmentation algorithm that is capable of clustering video frames into video segments. We then use these to classify and index the video segments. The proposed approach results in a higher True Positive Rate(TPR) 89.5% and lower False Discovery Rate(FDR) 11.2% compared with the commercial system(TPR=81.8%, FDR=39.4%) demonstrate that the performance is significantly improved by using enhanced features.

Key challenges include how to shorten transmission delays and increase the stability of transmissions. When establishing routing paths, most research focuses on detecting traffic and selecting roads with higher vehicle densities in order to transmit packets, thus avoiding carry-and-forward scenarios and decreasing transmission delays; however, such approaches may not obtain accurate real-time traffic densities by periodically monitoring each road because vehicle densities change so rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel routing information system called the machine learning-assisted route selection (MARS) system to estimate necessary information for routing protocols. In MARS, road information is maintained in roadside units with the help of machine learning. We use machine learning to predict the moves of vehicles and then choose some suitable routing paths with better transmission capacity to transmit packets. Further, MARS can help to decide the forwarding direction between two RSUs according to the predicted location of the destination and the estimated transmission delays in both forwarding directions. Our proposed system can provide in-time routing information for VANETs and greatly enhance network performance.

This creates the necessity of having a supervisory controller capable of recognizing different terrain types and changing the locomotion mode of the robot accordingly. This work focuses on the locomotion strategy selection problem for a hybrid legged wheeled mobile robot. Supervisory control of the robot is accomplished by the terrain recognizer, which classifies depth images obtained from a commercial time of flight depth sensor and selects different locomotion mode subcontrollers based on the recognized terrain type. For the terrain recognizer, a database is generated consisting of five terrain classes (Uneven, Level Ground, Stair Up, Stair Down, and Nontraversable). Depth images are enhanced using confidence map based filtering. The accuracy of the terrain classification using Support Vector Machine classifier for the testing database in five-class terrain recognition problem is 97%. Real-world experiments assess the locomotion abilities of the quadruped and the capability of the terrain recognizer in real-time settings. The results of these experiments show depth images processed in real time using machine learning algorithms can be used for the supervisory control of hybrid robots with legged and wheeled locomotion capabilities.

Such a community evaluation has not been previously executed. Task 1a included a total of 22 system submissions, and Task 1b included 17. Most of the systems employed a combination of rules and machine learners. Materials and methods We used a subset of the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) corpus of annotated clinical text-199 clinical notes for training and 99 for testing (roughly 180 K words in total). We provided the community with the annotated gold standard training documents to build systems to identify and normalize disorder mentions. The systems were tested on a held-out gold standard test set to measure their performance. Results For Task 1a, the best-performing system achieved an F-1 score of 0.75 (0.80 precision; 0.71 recall). For Task 1b, another system performed best with an accuracy of 0.59. Discussion Most of the participating systems used a hybrid approach by supplementing machine-learning algorithms with features generated by rules and gazetteers created from the training data and from external resources. Conclusions The task of disorder normalization is more challenging than that of identification. The ShARe corpus is available to the community as a reference standard for future studies.

Data and methods We collected eligibility criteria for 13 randomly selected, disease-specific clinical trials actively enrolling patients between January 1, 2010 and August 31, 2012. In parallel, we retrospectively selected data fields including demographics, laboratory data, and clinical notes from the electronic health record (EHR) to represent profiles of all 202795 patients visiting the ED during the same period. Leveraging NLP, IE, and ML technologies, the automated ES algorithms identified patients whose profiles matched the trial criteria to reduce the pool of candidates for staff screening. The performance was validated on both a physician-generated gold standard of trial-patient matches and a reference standard of historical trial-patient enrollment decisions, where workload, mean average precision (MAP), and recall were assessed. Results Compared with the case without automation, the workload with automated ES was reduced by 92% on the gold standard set, with a MAP of 62.9%. The automated ES achieved a 450% increase in trial screening efficiency. The findings on the gold standard set were confirmed by large-scale evaluation on the reference set of trial-patient matches. Discussion and conclusion By exploiting the text of trial criteria and the content of EHRs, we demonstrated that NLP-, IE-, and ML-based automated ES could successfully identify patients for clinical trials.

Gliomas are a class of brain cancer which invade into the normal brain. If left unresected, these invasive cancer cells are the source of glioma recurrence. Moreover, these invasion areas do not show up on standard-of-care pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This inability to fully visualize invasive brain cancers results in subtotal surgical resections, negatively impacting patient survival. To address this issue, we have demonstrated the efficacy of single-point in vivo Raman spectroscopy using a contact hand-held fiber optic probe for rapid detection of cancer invasion in 8 patients with low and high grade gliomas. Using a supervised machine learning algorithm to analyze the Raman spectra obtained in vivo, we were able to distinguish normal brain from the presence of cancer cells with sensitivity and specificity greater than 90%. Moreover, by correlating these results with pre-operative MRI we demonstrate the ability to detect low density cancer invasion up to 1.5cm beyond the cancer extent visible using MRI. This represents the potential for significant improvements in progression-free and overall patient survival, by identifying previously undetectable residual cancer cell populations and preventing the resection of normal brain tissue. While the importance of maximizing the volume of tumor resection is important for all grades of gliomas, the impact for low grade gliomas can be dramatic because surgery can even be curative. This convenient technology can rapidly classify cancer invasion in real-time, making it ideal for intraoperative use in brain tumor resection.

Simple, sensitive, and rapid detection of this pathogen is important for monitoring of drinking water. Here we present a cost-effective and field portable mobile-phone based fluorescence microscopy platform designed for automated detection of Giardia lamblia cysts in large volume water samples (i.e., 10 ml) to be used in low-resource field settings. This fluorescence microscope is integrated with a disposable water-sampling cassette, which is based on a flow-through porous polycarbonate membrane and provides a wide surface area for fluorescence imaging and enumeration of the captured Giardia cysts on the membrane. Water sample of interest, containing fluorescently labeled Giardia cysts, is introduced into the absorbent pads that are in contact with the membrane in the cassette by capillary action, which eliminates the need for electrically driven flow for sample processing. Our fluorescence microscope weighs similar to 170 grams in total and has all the components of a regular microscope, capable of detecting individual fluorescently labeled cysts under light-emitting-diode (LED) based excitation. Including all the sample preparation, labeling and imaging steps, the entire measurement takes less than one hour for a sample volume of 10 ml. This mobile phone based compact and cost-effective fluorescent imaging platform together with its machine learning based cyst counting interface is easy to use and can even work in resource limited and field settings for spatio-temporal monitoring of water quality.

The system includes the following: (1) object detection, which detects an object of interest based on a combination of motion detection and object classification and initializes tracking of the object if detected, (2) object tracking, which tracks the object over time based on template matching and reports its frame-to-frame displacement in pixels, (3) speed estimation, which estimates vehicle speed by converting pixel displacements to distances traveled along the road, (4) object height estimation, which estimates the distance from tracked point(s) of the object to the road plane, and (5) speed estimation with height-correction, which adjusts previously estimated vehicle speed based on estimated object and camera heights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on 30/60 fps videos of 300 vehicles travelling at speeds ranging from 30 to 60 mph. The 95-percentile speed estimation error was within +/- 3% when compared to a lidar-based reference instrument. Key contributions of our method include (1) tracking a specific set of feature points of a vehicle to ensure a consistent measure of speed, (2) a high accuracy camera calibration/characterization method, which does not interrupt regular traffic of the site, and (3) a license plate and camera height estimation method for improving accuracy of individual vehicle speed estimation. Additionally, we examine the impact of spatial resolution on accuracy of speed estimation and utilize that knowledge to improve computation efficiency. We also improve accuracy and efficiency of tracking over standard methods via dynamic update of templates and predictive local search.

A Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Driver Cell Phone Usage	VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AND TRANSPORTATION IMAGING APPLICATIONS 2015	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Video Surveillance and Transportation Imaging Applications	FEB 10-12, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE				Cell phone usage while driving is common, but widely considered dangerous due to distraction to the driver. Because of the high number of accidents related to cell phone usage while driving, several states have enacted regulations that prohibit driver cell phone usage while driving. However, to enforce the regulation, current practice requires dispatching law enforcement officers at road side to visually examine incoming cars or having human operators manually examine image/video records to identify violators. Both of these practices are expensive, difficult, and ultimately ineffective. Therefore, there is a need for a semi-automatic or automatic solution to detect driver cell phone usage. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-based method for detecting driver cell phone usage using a camera system directed at the vehicle's front windshield. The developed method consists of two stages: first, the frontal windshield region localization using the deformable part model (DPM), next, we utilize Fisher vectors (FV) representation to classify the driver's side of the windshield into cell phone usage violation and non-violation classes. The proposed method achieved about 95% accuracy with a data set of more than 100 images with drivers in a variety of challenging poses with or without cell phones.

In particular, in single molecule localization (SML) microscopy techniques (STORM, PALM, etc.) a high Strehl ratio point spread function (PSF) is necessary to achieve sub-diffraction resolution. Distortions in the PSF shape directly reduce the resolution of SML microscopy. The system aberrations caused by the imperfections in the optics and instruments can be compensated using Adaptive Optics (AO) techniques prior to imaging. However, aberrations caused by the biological sample, both static and dynamic, have to be dealt with in real time. A challenge for wavefront correction in SML microscopy is a robust optimization approach in the presence of noise because of the naturally high fluctuations in photon emission from single molecules. Here we demonstrate particle swarm optimization for real time correction of the wavefront using an intensity independent metric. We show that the particle swarm algorithm converges faster than the genetic algorithm for bright fluorophores.

Activating LXRs represents a promising therapeutic option for dyslipidemia. However, activating LXR alpha may cause unwanted lipogenicity. A better anti-dyslipidemia strategy would be to develop selective LXR beta agonists that do not activate LXR alpha. In this paper, a data set of 234 selective and non-selective LXRb agonists was collected from the literature. For the first time, we derived the classification models from the data set to predict selective LXR beta agonists using multiple machine learning methods (naive Bayesian (NB), Recursive Partitioning (RP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) methods) with optimized property descriptors and structural fingerprints. The models were optimized from 324 multiple machine learning models, and most of the models showed high predictive abilities (overall predictive accuracies of >80%) for both training and test sets. The top 15 models were evaluated using an external test set of 76 compounds (all containing new scaffolds), and 10 of them displayed overall predictive accuracies exceeding 90%. The top models can be used for the virtual screening of selective LXR beta agonists. The NB models can identify privileged and unprivileged fragments for selective LXR beta agonists, and the fragments can be used to guide the design of new selective LXR beta agonists.

Our work is aimed at increasing the narrow communication bandwidth between the human and computer by implicitly measuring users' cognitive state without any additional effort on the part of the user. Traditionally, BCIs have been designed to explicitly send signals as the primary input. However, such systems are usually designed for people with severe motor disabilities and are too slow and inaccurate for the general population. In this paper, we demonstrate with previous work(1) that a BCI that implicitly measures cognitive workload can improve user performance and awareness compared to a control condition by adapting to user cognitive state in real-time. We also discuss some of the other applications we have used in this field to measure and respond to cognitive states such as cognitive workload, multitasking, and user preference.

Materials & methods: Seven models, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network, regression tree, boosted regression tree, support vector regression, multivariate adaptive regression spines and random forest regression, as well as the genetic and clinical data of two Chinese samples were employed. Results: The average predicted achievement ratio and mean absolute error of the algorithms were ranging from 52.31 to 58.08% and 4.25 to 4.84 mg/week in validation samples, respectively.

This is achieved by immobilizing the patient's head (typically by using thermoplastic masks, bite blocks or combinations thereof) and X-ray imaging to determine the actual position of the patient with respect to the treatment device. In previous work we have developed a novel method for marker-less and non-invasive tracking of the skull using a combination of laser-based surface triangulation and the analysis of backscattered feature patterns of a tightly collimated NIR laser beam scanned over the patient's forehead. An HDR camera is coupled into the beam path of the laser scanning system to acquire one image per projected laser point. We have demonstrated that this setup is capable of accurately determining the tissue thickness for each triangulation point and consequently allows detecting the surface of the cranial bone with sub-millimetre accuracy. Typical clinical settings (treatment times of 15-90 min) require feature stability over time, since the determination of tissue thickness is achieved by machine learning methods trained on initial feature scans. We have collected initial scans of the forehead as well as long-term backscatter data (20 images per seconds over 30 min) from five subjects and extracted the relevant tissue features from the image streams. Based on the knowledge of the relationship between the tissue feature values and the tissue thickness, the analysis of the long-term data showed that the noise level is low enough to allow robust discrimination of tissue thicknesses of 0.5 mm.

At the first step, a small database containing information of DILI in humans was created and annotated by experimentally observed information concerning hepatotoxic effects. Thus, for each compound a binary annotation "yes/no" was applied to DILI and seven endpoints causing different liver pathologies in humans: Cholestasis (CH), Oxidative Stress (OS), Mitochondrial injury (MT), Cirrhosis and Steatosis (CS), Hepatitis (HS), Hepatocellular (HC), and Reactive Metabolite (RM). Different machine-learning methods were used to build classification models linking DILI with molecular structure: Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forests. Three types of models were developed: (i) involving molecular descriptors calculated directly from chemical structure, (ii) involving selected endpoints as "biological" descriptors, and (iii) involving both types of descriptors. It has been found that the models based solely on molecular descriptors have much weaker prediction performance than those involving in vivo measured endpoints. Taking into account difficulties in obtaining of in vivo data, at the validation stage we used instead five endpoints (CH, CS, HC, MT and OS) measured in vitro in human hepatocyte cultures. The models involving either some of experimental in vitro endpoints or their combination with theoretically calculated ones correctly predict DILI for 9 out of 10 reference compounds of the external test set. This opens an interesting perspective to use for DILI predictions a combination of theoretically calculated parameters and measured in vitro biological data.

Among ACMs, variational level set methods have been used to build an active contour with the aim of modeling arbitrarily complex shapes. Moreover, they can handle also topological changes of the contours. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) have attracted the attention of many computer vision scientists, particularly in modeling an active contour based on the idea of utilizing the prototypes (weights) of a SOM to control the evolution of the contour. SOM-based models have been proposed in general with the aim of exploiting the specific ability of SOMs to learn the edge-map information via their topology preservation property and overcoming some drawbacks of other ACMs, such as trapping into local minima of the image energy functional to be minimized in such models. In this survey, we illustrate the main concepts of variational level set-based ACMs, SOM-based ACMs, and their relationship and review in a comprehensive fashion the development of their state-of-the-art models from a machine learning perspective, with a focus on their strengths and weaknesses.

This paper proposes a highly accurate and low-false-alarm hotspot detection framework. To define an appropriate and simplified layout feature for classification model training, we propose a novel feature space evaluation index. Furthermore, by applying a robust classifier based on the probability distribution function of layout features, our framework can achieve very high accuracy and almost zero false alarm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in that our detector outperforms other works in the 2012 ICCAD contest in terms of both accuracy and false alarm.

Enhancement of Galaxy Images for Improved Classification	IMAGE PROCESSING: ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS XIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Processing - Algorithms and Systems XIII	FEB 10-11, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		Galaxy images; image enhancement; heap transform; classification; support vector machine	AUTOMATED MORPHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; REPRESENTATION; STAR	In this paper, the classification accuracy of galaxy images is demonstrated to be improved by enhancing the galaxy images. Galaxy images often contain faint regions that are of similar intensity to stars and the image background, resulting in data loss during background subtraction and galaxy segmentation. Enhancement darkens these faint regions, enabling them to be distinguished from other objects in the image and the image background, relative to their original intensities. The heap transform is employed for the purpose of enhancement. Segmentation then produces a galaxy image which closely resembles the structure of the original galaxy image, and one that is suitable for further processing and classification. Morphological feature descriptors are applied to the segmented images after a preprocessing stage and used to extract the galaxy image structure for use in training the classifier. The support vector machine learning algorithm performs training and validation of the original and enhanced data, and a comparison between the classification accuracy of each data set is included. Principal component analysis is used to compress the data sets for the purpose of classification visualization and a comparison between the reduced and original feature spaces. Future directions for this research include galaxy image enhancement by various methods, and classification performed with the use of a sparse dictionary. Both future directions are introduced.

No-reference visual quality assessment for image inpainting	IMAGE PROCESSING: ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS XIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Processing - Algorithms and Systems XIII	FEB 10-11, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		inpainting; quality assessment; metric; SVR; visual salience; machine learning		Inpainting has received a lot of attention in recent years and quality assessment is an important task to evaluate different image reconstruction approaches. In many cases inpainting methods introduce a blur in sharp transitions in image and image contours in the recovery of large areas with missing pixels and often fail to recover curvy boundary edges. Quantitative metrics of inpainting results currently do not exist and researchers use human comparisons to evaluate their methodologies and techniques. Most objective quality assessment methods rely on a reference image, which is often not available in inpainting applications. Usually researchers use subjective quality assessment by human observers. It is difficult and time consuming procedure. This paper focuses on a machine learning approach for no-reference visual quality assessment for image inpainting based on the human visual property. Our method is based on observation that Local Binary Patterns well describe local structural information of the image. We use a support vector regression learned on assessed by human images to predict perceived quality of inpainted images. We demonstrate how our predicted quality value correlates with qualitative opinion in a human observer study. Results are shown on a human-scored dataset for different inpainting methods.

Due to the challenges of designing spatial ontologies, the extraction of spatial information from natural language still has to be placed in a well-defined framework. In this work, we propose an ontology which bridges between cognitive-linguistic spatial concepts in natural language and multiple qualitative spatial representation and reasoning models. To make a mapping between natural language and the spatial ontology, we propose a novel global machine learning framework for ontology population. In this framework we consider relational features and background knowledge which originate from both ontological relationships between the concepts and the structure of the spatial language. The advantage of the proposed global learning model is the scalability of the inference, and the flexibility for automatically describing text with arbitrary semantic labels that form a structured ontological representation of its content. The machine learning framework is evaluated with SemEval-2012 and SemEval-2013 data from the spatial role labeling task. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Boundaries between host image and forgery can be concealed, illumination changed, and so on, in a naive form of counter-forensics. For this reason, most modern techniques for forgery detection rely on the statistical distribution of micro-patterns, enhanced through high-level filtering, and summarized in some image descriptor used for the final classification. In this work we propose a strategy to modify the forged image at the level of micro-patterns to fool a state-of-the-art forgery detector. Then, we investigate on the effectiveness of the proposed strategy as a function of the level of knowledge on the forgery detection algorithm. Experiments show this approach to be quite effective especially if a good prior knowledge on the detector is available.

We argue that such a circumstance is realistic and likely in practice. In 'laboratory conditions' mimicking circumstances favourable to the analyst, and with a custom set of digital images which capture the same scenes with controlled amounts of overlap, we use an overlapping reference image to calibrate steganographic features of the image under analysis. Experimental results show that the analysed image can be classified as cover or stego with much greater reliability than traditional steganalysis not exploiting overlapping content, and the improvement in reliability depends on the amount of overlap. These results are curious because two different photographs of exactly the same scene, taken only a few seconds apart with a fixed camera and settings, typically have steganographic features that differ by considerably more than a cover and stego image.

J	March, WB; Xiao, B; Biros, G				March, William B.; Xiao, Bo; Biros, George			ASKIT: APPROXIMATE SKELETONIZATION KERNEL-INDEPENDENT TREECODE IN HIGH DIMENSIONS	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						N-body problems; treecodes; machine learning; kernel methods; multiscale matrix approximations; kernel independent fast multipole methods; randomized matrix approximations	FAST MULTIPOLE METHOD; MATRIX DECOMPOSITIONS; ALGORITHMS	We present a fast algorithm for kernel summation problems in high dimensions. Such problems appear in computational physics, numerical approximation, nonparametric statistics, and machine learning. In our context, the sums depend on a kernel function that is a pair potential defined on a dataset of points in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. A direct evaluation of the sum scales quadratically with the number of points. Fast kernel summation methods can reduce this cost to linear complexity, but the constants involved do not scale well with the dimensionality of the dataset. The main algorithmic components of fast kernel summation algorithms are the separation of the kernel sum between near and far field (which is the basis for pruning) and the efficient and accurate approximation of the far field. We introduce novel methods for pruning and for approximating the far field. Our far field approximation requires only kernel evaluations and does not use analytic expansions. Pruning is not done using bounding boxes but rather combinatorially using a sparsified nearest-neighbor graph of the input distribution. The time complexity of our algorithm depends linearly on the ambient dimension. The error in the algorithm depends on the low-rank approximability of the far field, which in turn depends on the kernel function and on the intrinsic dimensionality of the distribution of the points. The error of the far field approximation does not depend on the ambient dimension. We present the new algorithm along with experimental results that demonstrate its performance. As a highlight, we report results for Gaussian kernel sums for 100 million points in 64 dimensions, for one million points in 1000 dimensions, and for problems in which the Gaussian kernel has a variable bandwidth. To the best of our knowledge, all of these experiments are prohibitively expensive with existing fast kernel summation methods.

Anatole			Many Molecular Properties from One Kernel in Chemical Space	CHIMIA			English	Article						Chemical Space; Kernel Ridge Regression; Machine learning; Molecular properties; Quantum chemistry	BIG DATA; PRINCIPLE; SCIENCE	We introduce property-independent kernels for machine learning models of arbitrarily many molecular properties. The kernels encode molecular structures for training sets of varying size, as well as similarity measures sufficiently diffuse in chemical space to sample over all training molecules. When provided with the corresponding molecular reference properties, they enable the instantaneous generation of machine learning models which can be systematically improved through the addition of more data. This idea is exemplified for single kernel based modeling of internal energy, enthalpy, free energy, heat capacity, polarizability, electronic spread, zero-point vibrational energy, energies of frontier orbitals, HOMO-LUMO gap, and the highest fundamental vibrational wavenumber. Models of these properties are trained and tested using 112,000 organic molecules of similar size. The resulting models are discussed as well as the kernels' use for generating and using other property models.	[Ramakrishnan, Raghunathan; von Lilienfeld, O.

J	Zeng, GP				Zeng, Guoping			A Unified Definition of Mutual Information with Applications in Machine Learning	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								There are various definitions of mutual information. Essentially, these definitions can be divided into two classes: (1) definitions with random variables and (2) definitions with ensembles. However, there are some mathematical flaws in these definitions. For instance, Class 1 definitions either neglect the probability spaces or assume the two random variables have the same probability space. Class 2 definitions redefine marginal probabilities from the joint probabilities. In fact, the marginal probabilities are given from the ensembles and should not be redefined from the joint probabilities. Both Class 1 and Class 2 definitions assume a joint distribution exists. Yet, they all ignore an important fact that the joint or the joint probability measure is not unique. In this paper, we first present a new unified definition of mutual information to cover all the various definitions and to fix their mathematical flaws. Our idea is to define the joint distribution of two random variables by taking the marginal probabilities into consideration. Next, we establish some properties of the newly defined mutual information. We then propose a method to calculate mutual information in machine learning. Finally, we apply our newly defined mutual information to credit scoring.

In this study, an ensemble-based supervised classification algorithm for high-resolution histology images was trained on tile-based image features including histogram and gray-level co-occurrence statistics. The algorithm was assessed using different combinations of H&E prostate slides from two separate medical centers and at two different magnifications (400x and 200x), with the aim of applying tumor classification models to new data. Slides from both datasets were annotated by expert pathologists in order to identify homogeneous cancerous and non-cancerous tissue regions of interest, which were then categorized as (1) low-grade tumor (LG-PCa), including Gleason 3 and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN), (2) high-grade tumor (HG-PCa), including various Gleason 4 and 5 patterns, or (3) non-cancerous, including benign stroma and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Classification models for both LG-PCa and HG-PCa were separately trained using a support vector machine (SVM) approach, and per-tile tumor prediction maps were generated from the resulting ensembles. Results showed high sensitivity for predicting HG-PCa with an AUC up to 0.822 using training data from both medical centres, while LG-PCa showed a lower sensitivity of 0.763 with the same training data. Visual inspection of cancer probability heatmaps from 9 patients showed that 17/19 tumors were detected, and HG-PCa generally reported less false positives than LG-PCa.

Therefore, it is also a potent (contra) indicator for adjuvant chemotherapy. However, quantification of tumor and stroma through visual estimation is highly subject to intra-and interobserver variability. The aim of this study is to develop and clinically validate a method for objective quantification of tumor and stroma in standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained microscopy slides of rectal carcinomas. A tissue segmentation algorithm, based on supervised machine learning and pixel classification, was developed, trained and validated using histological slides that were prepared from surgically excised rectal carcinomas in patients who had not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Whole-slide scanning was performed at 20x magnification. A total of 40 images (4 million pixels each) were extracted from 20 whole-slide images at sites showing various relative proportions of tumor and stroma. Experienced pathologists provided detailed annotations for every extracted image. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using cross-validation by testing on 1 image at a time while using the other 39 images for training. The total classification error of the algorithm was 9.4% (SD = 3.2%). Compared to visual estimation by pathologists, the algorithm was 7.3 times (P = 0.033) more accurate in quantifying tissues, also showing 60% less variability. Automatic tissue quantification was shown to be both reliable and practicable. We ultimately intend to facilitate refined prognostic stratification of (colo) rectal cancer patients and enable better personalized treatment.	[Geessink, Oscar G.

A Circumscribing Active Contour Model for Delineation of Nuclei and Membranes of Megalcaryocytes in Bone Marrow Trephine Biopsy Images	MEDICAL IMAGING 2015: DIGITAL PATHOLOGY	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Digital Pathology	FEB 25-26, 2015	Orlando, FL	SPIE, ALIO Ind, Alpin Med Syst, Modus Med Devices Inc, Bruker		Megakaryocyte detection; Digital pathology; Bone marrow trephine biopsy; Active contour	MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES	The assessment of megakaryocytes (MKs) in bone marrow trephine images is an important step in the classification of different subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In general, bone marrow trephine images include several types of cells mixed together, which make it quite difficult to visually identify MKs. In order to aid hematopathologists in the identification and study of MKs, we develop an image processing framework with supervised machine learning approaches and a novel circumscribing active contour model to identify potential MKs and then to accurately delineate the corresponding nucleus and membrane. Specifically, a number of color and texture features are used in a nave Bayesian classifier and an Adaboost classifier to locate the regions with a high probability of depicting MKs. A region-based active contour is used on the candidate MKs to accurately delineate the boundaries of nucleus and membrane. The proposed circumscribing active contour model employs external forces not only based on pixel intensities, but also on the probabilities of depicting MKs as computed by the classifiers. Experimental results suggest that the machine learning approach can detect potential MKs with an accuracy of more than 75%. When our circumscribing active contour model is employed on the candidate MKs, the nucleus and membrane boundaries are segmented with an accuracy of more than 80% as measured by the Dice similarity coefficient. Compared to traditional region-based active contours, the use of additional external forces based on the probability of depicting MKs improves segmentation performance and computational time by an average 5%.

Amongst various machine learning approaches, moving average analysis (MAA) has frequently exhibited high accuracy of prediction of diverse biological activities against different biological targets and experimental conditions. Role of MAA in developing (Q) SAR models for prediction of single/dual or multi target activity has been briefly reviewed in the present article. Subsequently, MAA was successfully utilized for developing mt-(Q) SAR models for simultaneous prediction of anti-Plasmodium falciparum and anti-Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense activities of benzyl phenyl ether derivatives. The statistical significance of models was assessed through intercorrelation analysis, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient. Proposed MAA based models were also validated using test set. High predictability of the order of 80% to 95% amalgamated with safety (indicated by high value of selectivity index) of proposed mt-(Q) SAR models justifies use of MAA in developing models in order to obtain more realistic and accurate results for prediction of anti-protozal activity against multiple targets. Active ranges of the proposed models can play a significant role in the development of novel, potent, versatile and safe anti-protozoal drugs with improved profile in terms of both anti-Plasmodium falciparum and anti-Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense activities.

As the critical dimension (CD) of the integrated circuits continuously shrinks, the thick mask near-field calculation has increasing influence on the accuracy and efficiency of the entire aerial image calculation process. This paper develops a flexible library-based approach to significantly improve the efficiency of the thick mask near-field calculation compared to the rigorous modeling method, while leading to much higher accuracy than the Kirchhoff approximation method. Specifically, a set of typical features on the fullchip are selected to serve as the training data, whose near-fields are pre-calculated and saved in the library. Given an arbitrary test mask, we first decompose it into convex corners, concave corners and edges, afterwards match each patch to the training layouts based on nonparametric kernel regression. Subsequently, we use the matched near-fields in the library to replace the mask patches, and rapidly synthesize the near-field for the entire test mask. Finally, a data-fitting method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the synthesized near-field based on least square estimate (LSE). We use a pair of two-dimensional mask patterns to test our method. Simulations show that the proposed method can significantly speed up the current FDTD method, and effectively improve the accuracy of the Kirchhoff approximation method.

Although the most widely used model-based OPC is expected to achieve highly accurate correction, it is also known to be extremely time-consuming. This paper proposes a regression model for OPC using a Hierarchical Bayes Model (HBM). The goal of the regression model is to reduce the number of iterations in model-based OPC. Our approach utilizes a Bayes inference technique to learn the optimal parameters from given data. All parameters are estimated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Experimental results show that utilizing HBM can achieve a better solution than other conventional models, e.g., linear regression based model, or non-linear regression based model. In addition, our regression results can be fed as the starting point of conventional model based OPC, through which we are able to overcome the runtime bottleneck.

Our approach first learns a probabilistic model from existing data and then uses this model to predict properties of new, unseen programs. The key idea of our work is to transform the input program into a representation which allows us to phrase the problem of inferring program properties as structured prediction in machine learning. This formulation enables us to leverage powerful probabilistic graphical models such as conditional random fields (CRFs) in order to perform joint prediction of program properties. As an example of our approach, we built a scalable prediction engine called JSNICE(1) for solving two kinds of problems in the context of JavaScript: predicting (syntactic) names of identifiers and predicting (semantic) type annotations of variables. Experimentally, JSNICE predicts correct names for 63% of name identifiers and its type annotation predictions are correct in 81% of the cases. In the first week since its release, JSNICE was used by more than 30, 000 developers and in only few months has become a popular tool in the JavaScript developer community. By formulating the problem of inferring program properties as structured prediction and showing how to perform both learning and inference in this context, our work opens up new possibilities for attacking a wide range of difficult problems in the context of "Big Code" including invariant generation, de-compilation, synthesis and others.

J	Lee, P				Lee, Peter			Coding by Everyone, Every Day	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						natural user interaction; digital assistants		In recent years, advances in machine learning and related fields have led to significant advances in a range of user-interface technologies, including audio processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing. These advances in turn have enabled speech-based digital assistants and speech-to-speech translation systems to become practical to deploy on a large scale. In essence, machines are becoming capable of hearing what we are saying. But will they understand what we want them to do when we talk to them? What are the prospects for getting useful work done - in essence, by synthesizing programs - through the act of having a conversation with a computer? In this lecture, I will speculate on the central role that programming-language design and program synthesis may have in this possible - and I will argue, likely future of computing, one in which every user writes programs, every day, by conversing with a computing system.

We develop a decision function (or functions), which receives n geometry parameters of a GP as inputs and predicts whether the GP faithfully produces desired contacts (good) or not (bad). We take a few sample GPs to construct the function; DSA simulations are performed for each GP to decide whether it is good or bad, and the decision is marked in n-dimensional space. The hyper-plane that separates good marks and bad marks in that space is determined through machine learning process, and corresponds to our decision function. We try a single global function that can be applied to any GP types, and a series of functions in which each function is customized for different GP type; they are then compared and assessed in 10nm technology.

Only in a few cases the expression of a gene is controlled by a variant on a single genetic marker. There is a plethora of different complexity levels of interaction effects within markers, within genes and between marker and genes. This complexity challenges biostatisticians and bioinformatitians every day and makes findings difficult to appear. As a way to simplify analysis and better control confounders, we tried a new approach for association analysis between genotypes and expression data. We pursued to understand whether discretization of expression data can be useful in genome-transcriptome association analyses. By discretizing the dependent variable, algorithms for learning classifiers from data as well as performing block selection were used to help understanding the relationship between the expression of a gene and genetic markers. We present the results of using this approach to detect new possible causes of expression variation of DRB5, a gene playing an important role within the immune system. Together with expression of gene DRB5 obtained from the classical microarray technology, we have also measured DRB5 expression by using the more recent next-generation sequencing technology.

Nevertheless, current MSA methodologies are providing quite different alignments for the same set of sequences depending on some particular biological features of these sequences. For this reason, the selection of a suitable tool for aligning a specific set of sequences is an important task which has not been totally solved yet. In this work, we propose a hierarchical algorithm of several binary classifiers based on support vector machines (SVMs) to predict "a priori" the MSA tool which will provide the most accurate alignment. Firstly, a set of heterogeneous biological features related to each set of sequences are retrieved from well-known databases. Subsequently, those most significant features according to each specific aligner are included in this particular classifier. Finally, the SVM classifiers are joined to decide the most suitable method according to the quality of each classification. This procedure was assessed by the benchmark BAliBASE v3.0 and compared against other similar tools, namely AlexSys and PAcAlCI.

Due to low publication barrier, anonymity and wide penetration, Twitter has become an easy target or platform for extremists to disseminate their ideologies and opinions by posting hate and extremism promoting tweets. Millions of tweets are posted on Twitter everyday and it is practically impossible for Twitter moderators or an intelligence and security analyst to manually identify such tweets, users and communities. However, automatic classification of tweets into pre-defined categories is a non-trivial problem problem due to short text of the tweet (the maximum length of a tweet can be 140 characters) and noisy content (incorrect grammar, spelling mistakes, presence of standard and non-standard abbreviations and slang). We frame the problem of hate and extremism promoting tweet detection as a one-class or unary-class categorization problem by learning a statistical model from a training set containing only the objects of one class. We propose several linguistic features such as presence of war, religious, negative emotions and offensive terms to discriminate hate and extremism promoting tweets from other tweets. We employ a single-class SVM and KNN algorithm for one-class classification task. We conduct a case-study on Jihad, perform a characterization study of the tweets and measure the precision and recall of the machine-learning based classifier. Experimental results on large and real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective with F-score of 0.60 and 0.83 for the KNN and SVM classifier respectively.

One of the reasons is the lack of readily available open-source software packages which can easily calculate calibration metrics. In order to provide one such tool, we have developed a custom modification of the Weka data mining software, which implements the calculation of Hosmer-Lemeshow groups of risk and the Pearson chi-square statistic comparison between estimated and observed frequencies for binary problems. We provide calibration performance estimations with Logistic regression (LR), BayesNet, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees and Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) models with six different datasets. Our experiments show that SVMs with RBF kernels exhibit the best results in terms of calibration, while decision trees, RIPPER and KNN are highly unlikely to produce well-calibrated models.

In this area, a rare class is the class of primary interest from the aim of classification. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning algorithms fail to detect this class because a huge majority class overwhelms a tiny minority class. In this paper, we propose a new technique called CORE to handle the class imbalance problem. The objective of CORE is to strengthen the core of a minority class and weaken the risk of misclassified minority instances nearby the borderline of a majority class. These core and borderline regions are defined by the applicability of a safe level. As a result, a minority class is more crowed and dominant. The experiment shows that CORE can significantly improve the predictive performance of a minority class when its dataset is imbalance.

Continuous improvements in lithography and processing performance over the past years have resulted in consequent overlay performance improvement for critical layers. Identification of the remaining factors causing systematic disturbances and inefficiencies will further reduce overlay. By building a context database, mappings between context, fingerprints and alignment & overlay metrology can be learned through techniques from pattern recognition and data mining (Fig. 1). [GRAPHICS] Figure 1. Building a context database that describes the life of a wafer in the scanner and the fab. We relate structure ('patterns') in the metrology data to relevant contextual factors. Once understood, these factors could be moved to the known effects (e.g. the presence of systematic fingerprints from reticle writing error or lens and reticle heating). Hence, we build up a knowledge base of known effects based on data. Outcomes from such an integral ('holistic') approach to lithography data analysis may be exploited in a model-based predictive overlay controller that combines feedback and feedforward control [1]. Hence, the available measurements from scanner, fab and metrology equipment are combined to reveal opportunities for further overlay improvement which would otherwise go unnoticed.

With a machine learning technique known as function approximation, we use a neural network to gain insight to how known contributors, such as those collected with scanner metrology, influence the on product overlay budget. The result is a sufficiently trained function that can approximate overlay for all wafers exposed with the lithography system. As a real world application, inline metrology can be used to measure overlay for a few wafers while using the trained function to approximate overlay vector maps for the entire lot of wafers. With the approximated overlay vector maps for all wafers coming off the track, a process engineer can redirect wafers or lots with overlay signatures outside the standard population to offline metrology for excursion validation. With this added flexibility, engineers will be given more opportunities to catch wafers that need to be reworked, resulting in improved yield. The quality of the derived corrections from measured overlay metrology feedback can be improved using the approximated overlay to trigger, which wafers should or shouldn't be, measured inline. As a development or integration engineer the approximated overlay can be used to gain insight into lots and wafers used for design of experiments (DOE) troubleshooting.

These changes require tight controls on processes and measurements to achieve the required device performance, and challenge the metrology and process control in terms of capability and quality. Multivariate data with complex nonlinear trends and correlations generally cannot be described well by mathematical or parametric models but can be relatively easily learned by computing machines and used to predict or extrapolate. This paper introduces the predictive metrology approach which has been applied to three different applications. Machine learning and predictive analytics have been leveraged to accurately predict dimensions of EUV resist patterns down to 18 nm half pitch leveraging resist shrinkage patterns. These patterns could not be directly and accurately measured due to metrology tool limitations. Machine learning has also been applied to predict the electrical performance early in the process pipeline for deep trench capacitance and metal line resistance. As the wafer goes through various processes its associated cost multiplies. It may take days to weeks to get the electrical performance readout. Predicting the electrical performance early on can be very valuable in enabling timely actionable decision such as rework, scrap, feedforward, feedback predicted information or information derived from prediction to improve or monitor processes. This paper provides a general overview of machine learning and advanced analytics application in the advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing.

Such tests are relatively time consuming and frequently rely on medical professionals tally counting specific cell types. These assays rely on the contrast generated by chemical stains, with the signal intensity strongly related to staining and preparation techniques, frustrating machine learning algorithms that require consistent quantities to denote the features in question. Instead we opt to use quantitative phase imaging, understanding that the resulting image is entirely due to the structure (intrinsic contrast) rather than the complex interplay of stain and sample. We present here our first steps to automate peripheral blood smear scanning, in particular a method to generate the quantitative phase image of an entire blood smear at high throughput using white light diffraction phase microscopy (wDPM), a single shot and common path interferometric imaging technique.

Even after clustering, the datasets retain sequences from multiple microbial species which contribute a considerable amount of variation that conceals the errors. The application of standard denoising algorithms available for genomics is no longer possible because of the high rate of false positives in regions with natural variation in the data; at the same time rare natural variants are a subject of study where they need to be distinguished from the errors. This work uses machine learning to filter some of the false positives of other error discovery algorithms. A neural network and a random forest have been trained to identify the errors in the datasets with an accuracy of over 99%. While still insufficient for direct discovery of rare errors, it is demonstrated that the trained models provide a good filter to reduce the amount of incorrectly identified errors without an increase in the false negatives.

MLC is based on Bayesian theory in estimating parameters of a probabilistic model, whilst SVM is an optimization based nonparametric method in this context. Recently, it is found that SVM in some cases is equivalent to MLC in probabilistically modeling the learning process. In this paper, MLC and SVM are combined in learning and classification, which helps to yield probabilistic output for SVM and facilitate soft decision making. In total four groups of data are used for evaluations, covering sonar, vehicle, breast cancer, and DNA sequences. The data samples are characterized in terms of Gaussian/non-Gaussian distributed and balanced/unbalanced samples which are then further used for performance assessment in comparing the SVM and the combined SVM-MLC classifier. Interesting results are reported to indicate how the combined classifier may work under various conditions.

In a pool-based electric energy market, producers submit selling bids consisting in energy blocks and their corresponding minimum selling prices to the market operator. Meanwhile, consumers submit buying bids consisting in energy blocks and their corresponding maximum buying prices to the market operator. Hence, both producers and consumers use day ahead price forecasts to derive their respective bidding strategies to the electricity market yet reduce the cost of electricity. However, forecasting electricity prices is a complex task because price series is a non-stationary and highly volatile series. Many factors cause for price spikes such as volatility in load and fuel price as well as power import to and export from outside the market through long term contract. This paper introduces an approach of machine learning algorithm for day ahead electricity price forecasting with Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). Previous day data of Hourly Ontario Electricity Price (HOEP), generation's price and demand from Ontario power market are used as the inputs for training data. The simulation is held using LSSVMlab in Matlab with the training and testing data of 2004. SVM that widely used for classification and regression has great generalization ability with structured risk minimization principle rather than empirical risk minimization. Moreover, same parameter settings in trained SVM give same results that absolutely reduce simulation process compared to other techniques such as neural network and time series. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the proposed model shows that SVM performs well compared to neural network.

Nonetheless, its application in ecology is scarce. This study aims to demonstrate and compare the classification performance of SVMs models developed with weights and models developed with adoption of systematic random under-sampling technique in predicting a one-class independent dataset. The data used is a typical imbalanced real-world data with 700 data points where only 11% are sighted data points. Conversely, the one-class independent real-world dataset, with twenty data points, used for prediction consists of sighted data only. Both datasets are characterized with seven attributes. The results show that the former models have reported overall accuracy ranged between 87.62% and 90% with G-mean between 0% and 30.07% (0% to 9.09% sensitivity and 97.34% to 100% specificity) while the ROC-AUC values ranged between 75.92% and 88.78%. The latter models have reported overall accuracy ranged between 67.39% and 78.26% with G-mean between 66.51% and 76.30% (78.26% to 95.65% sensitivity and 52.17% to 60.87% specificity) while the ROC-AUC values ranged between 72.59% and 85.82%. Nevertheless, the former models could barely predict the independent dataset successfully. Majority of the models fail to predict a single sighted data point and the best prediction accuracy reported is 30%. The classification performance of the latter models is surprisingly encouraging where majority of the models manage to achieve more than 30% prediction accuracy. In addition, many of the models are capable to attain 65% prediction accuracy, more than double the performance of the former models. Current study thus suggests that, where highly imbalanced ecology data is concerned, modeling using SVMs adopting systematic random undersampling technique is a more promising mean than w-SVM in obtaining much rewarding classification results for a one-class independent dataset.

In our study, it is regarded as an incomplete information game with unpublicized game strategies. We solve our problem by establishing a machine learning model using Bayes formula. The model established is referred to as the Bayes model. Based on the Bayesian model, we can make the prediction of players' choices to better complete the unknown information in the game. And we suggest the hash table to make improvement in space and time complexity. We build a game system with several types of game strategy for testing. In double- or multiplayer games, the Bayes model is more superior to other strategy models; the total income using Bayes model is higher than that of other models. Moreover, from the result of the games on the natural model with Bayes model, as well as the natural model with TFT model, it is found that Bayes model accrued more benefits than TFT model on average. This demonstrates that the Bayes model introduced in this study is feasible and effective. Therefore, it provides a novel method of solving incomplete information game problem.

Daily Life Activity Routine Discovery in Hemiparetic Rehabilitation Patients Using Topic Models	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Rehabilitation; ambulatory monitoring; activities of daily living; behavior; computer-assisted signal processing; discovery; topic model; wearable sensors	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; WEARABLE SENSORS; STROKE; ACCELEROMETRY	Background: Monitoring natural behavior and activity routines of hemiparetic rehabilitation patients across the day can provide valuable progress information for therapists and patients and contribute to an optimized rehabilitation process. In particular, continuous patient monitoring could add type, frequency and duration of daily life activity routines and hence complement standard clinical scores that are assessed for particular tasks only. Machine learning methods have been applied to infer activity routines from sensor data. However, supervised methods require activity annotations to build recognition models and thus require extensive patient supervision. Discovery methods, including topic models could provide patient routine information and deal with variability in activity and movement performance across patients. Topic models have been used to discover characteristic activity routine patterns of healthy individuals using activity primitives recognized from supervised sensor data. Yet, the applicability of topic models for hemiparetic rehabilitation patients and techniques to derive activity primitives without supervision needs to be addressed. Objectives: We investigate, 1) whether a topic model-based activity routine discovery framework can infer activity routines of rehabilitation patients from wearable motion sensor data. 2) We compare the performance of our topic model-based activity routine discovery using rule-based and clustering-based activity vocabulary. Methods: We analyze the activity routine discovery in a dataset recorded with 11 hemiparetic rehabilitation patients during up to ten full recording days per individual in an ambulatory daycare rehabilitation center using wearable motion sensors attached to both wrists and the non-affected thigh. We introduce and compare rule-based and clusteringbased activity vocabulary to process statistical and frequency acceleration features to activity words. Activity words were used for activity routine pattern discovery using topic models based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Discovered activity routine patterns were then mapped to six categorized activity routines. Results: Using the rule-based approach, activity routines could be discovered with an average accuracy of 76% across all patients. The rule-based approach outperformed clustering by 10% and showed less confusions for predicted activity routines. Conclusion: Topic models are suitable to discover daily life activity routines in hemiparetic rehabilitation patients without trained classifiers and activity annotations. Activity routines show characteristic patterns regarding activity primitives including body and extremity postures and movement. A patient-independent rule set can be derived. Including expert knowledge supports successful activity routine discovery over completely data-driven clustering.

This can be reached by collecting the ADL (activities of daily living) data and further analysis within existing computing elements. In this research, a very recent algorithm named sequence prediction via enhanced episode discovery (SPEED) is modi, fled and in order to improve accuracy time component is included. Methods: The modified SPEED or M-SPEED is a sequence prediction algorithm, which modified the previous SPEED algorithm by using time duration of appliance's ON-OFF states to decide the next state. M-SPEED discovered periodic episodes of inhabitant behavior, trained it with learned episodes, and made decisions based on the obtained knowledge. Results: The results showed that M-SPEED, achieves 96.8% prediction accuracy, which is better than other time prediction algorithms like PUBS, ALZ with temporal rules and the previous SPEED. Conclusions: Since human behavior shows natural temporal patterns, duration times can be used to predict future events more accurately. This inhabitant activity prediction system will certainly improve the smart homes by ensuring safety and better care for elderly and handicapped people.	[Marufuzzaman, M.; Reaz, M. B. I.; Ali, M. A.

Towards computational design of zeolite catalysts for CO2 reduction	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; POROUS MATERIALS; GAS-ADSORPTION; SEPARATION; CARBON; CAPTURE; PREDICTION; STORAGE; ENERGY; COMBINATORIAL	Carbon dioxide, an energy waste by-product with significant environmental consequences can be utilized and converted into useful chemical products such as formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol or methane, but more energy and cost efficient catalytic processes are required. Here we develop the methodology for the intelligent selection of porous zeolites for dual-adsorption of hydrogen and carbon dioxide as templates for preparing the optimal catalytic environment for carbon dioxide reduction. Useful zeolite catalysts were computationally screened from over 300 thousand zeolite structures using a combination of molecular simulation and machine-learning techniques. Several of the top candidates were very promising energy-efficient templates for catalysis with the potential to perform at 50% above conventional reactors. It is also found that an optimal cavity size of around 6 angstrom is required to maximize the change in entropy-enthalpy upon adsorption with a maximum void space >30% to boost product formation per volume of material.

Feature Reduction Based on Genetic Algorithm and Hybrid Model for Opinion Mining	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article							SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION; REVIEWS	With the rapid growth of websites and web form the number of product reviews is available on the sites. An opinion mining system is needed to help the people to evaluate emotions, opinions, attitude, and behavior of others, which is used to make decisions based on the user preference. In this paper, we proposed an optimized feature reduction that incorporates an ensemble method of machine learning approaches that uses information gain and genetic algorithm as feature reduction techniques. We conducted comparative study experiments on multidomain review dataset and movie review dataset in opinion mining. The effectiveness of single classifiers Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine, and ensemble technique for opinion mining are compared on five datasets. The proposed hybrid method is evaluated and experimental results using information gain and genetic algorithm with ensemble technique perform better in terms of various measures for multidomain review and movie reviews. Classification algorithms are evaluated using McNemar's test to compare the level of significance of the classifiers.

A machine learning method was used to identify optimal sites for the establishment of Eucalyptus nitens seed orchards within the plantation forestry landscape of the summer rainfall region of South Africa. The ensemble classifier random forests (RF) was used to identify the environmental factors conducive to Eucalyptus nitens floral bud production, and, based on these, build a predictive model deployable to the plantation forestry landscape for identifying suitable areas for Eucalyptus nitens seed orchards. The RF model predicted site suitability likelihood for floral bud production with a high level of accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.83). Within the climatically optimal range for growing Eucalyptus nitens, flower bud production was more abundant and consistent on cold slopes, i.e. sites experiencing lower minimum air temperatures during spring and autumn. The model was applied to the commercial plantation forestry landscape for the purpose of indicating sites climatically optimal for floral bud production in Eucalyptus nitens and the establishment of breeding and seed production orchards of the same species.

These inflexible approaches are typically not able to cope with the complexities of the manufacturing environment, such as the instabilities, uncertainties and abrupt changes caused by internal and external disturbances, or a large number and variety of interacting, interdependent elements. A paradigm shift, e.g., novel organizing principles and methods, is needed for supporting the interoperability of dynamic alliances of agile and networked systems. Several solution proposals argue that the future of manufacturing and logistics lies in network-like, dynamic, open and reconfigurable systems of cooperative autonomous entities. The paper overviews various distributed approaches and technologies of control engineering and ICT that can support the realization of cooperative structures from the resource level to the level of networked enterprises. Standard results as well as recent advances from control theory, through cooperative game theory, distributed machine learning to holonic systems, cooperative enterprise modeling, system integration, and autonomous logistics processes are surveyed. A special emphasis is put on the theoretical developments and industrial applications of Robustly Feasible Model Predictive Control (RFMPC). Two case studies are also discussed: (i) a holonic, PROSA-based approach to generate short-term forecasts for an additive manufacturing system by means of a delegate multi-agent system (D-MAS); and (ii) an application of distributed RFMPC to a drinking water distribution system.

Popular discourse on financial distress forecasting focuses on developing the discrete models to improve the prediction. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel hybrid financial distress model based on combining various statistical and machine learning methods. Then multiple attribute decision making method is exploited to choose the optimized model from the implemented ones. Proposed approaches have also been applied in Iranian companies that performed previous models and it can be consolidated with the help of the hybrid approach.

Previous studies have shown that 2D texture features are effective at distinguishing between healthy and osteoarthritic regions of interest annotated in the radial zone of cartilage matrix on PCI-CT images. In this study, we further extend the texture analysis to 3D and investigate the ability of volumetric texture features at characterizing chondrocyte patterns in the cartilage matrix for purposes of classification. Here, we extracted volumetric texture features derived from Minkowski Functionals and gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) from 496 volumes of interest (VOI) annotated on PCI-CT images of human patellar cartilage specimens. The extracted features were then used in a machine-learning task involving support vector regression to classify ROIs as healthy or osteoarthritic. Classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The best classification performance was observed with GLCM features correlation (AUC = 0.83 +/- 0.06) and homogeneity (AUC = 0.82 +/- 0.07), which significantly outperformed all Minkowski Functionals (p < 0.05). These results suggest that such quantitative analysis of chondrocyte patterns in human patellar cartilage matrix involving GLCM-derived statistical features can distinguish between healthy and osteoarthritic tissue with high accuracy.

It has been shown that the combined analysis of diffusion and perfusion MRI datasets using high-level machine learning techniques leads to an improved prediction of final infarction compared to single perfusion parameter thresholding. However, most high-level classifiers require a previous training and, until now, it is ambiguous how many subjects are required for this, which is the focus of this work. 23 MRI datasets of acute stroke patients with known tissue outcome were used in this work. Relative values of diffusion and perfusion parameters as well as the binary tissue outcome were extracted on a voxel-by-voxel level for all patients and used for training of a random forest classifier. The number of patients used for training set definition was iteratively and randomly reduced from using all 22 other patients to only one other patient. Thus, 22 tissue outcome predictions were generated for each patient using the trained random forest classifiers and compared to the known tissue outcome using the Dice coefficient. Overall, a logarithmic relation between the number of patients used for training set definition and tissue outcome prediction accuracy was found. Quantitatively, a mean Dice coefficient of 0.45 was found for the prediction using the training set consisting of the voxel information from only one other patient, which increases to 0.53 if using all other patients (n=22). Based on extrapolation, 50-100 patients appear to be a reasonable tradeoff between tissue outcome prediction accuracy and effort required for data acquisition and preparation.

Recent advances in database capacity, algorithm efficiency, and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (dCNN), a machine learning technique, have enabled great CBIR success for general photographic images. Here, we investigate applying the leading ImageNet CBIR technique to clinically acquired medical images captured by the Vanderbilt Medical Center. Briefly, we (1) constructed a dCNN with four hidden layers, reducing dimensionality of an input scaled to 128x128 to an output encoded layer of 4x384, (2) trained the network using back-propagation 1 million random magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images, (3) labeled an independent set of 2100 images, and (4) evaluated classifiers on the projection of the labeled images into manifold space. Quantitative results were disappointing (averaging a true positive rate of only 20%); however, the data suggest that improvements would be possible with more evenly distributed sampling across labels and potential re-grouping of label structures. This prelimainry effort at automated classification of medical images with ImageNet is promising, but shows that more work is needed beyond direct adaptation of existing techniques.	[Sklan, Judah E.

Currently, manual preprocessing of every scan is required to locate body parts before analysis can be performed, leading to a significant time overhead. With the volume of scans becoming available set to increase as cine-MRI scans become more prevalent in clinical practice, this stage of manual preprocessing is a bottleneck, limiting the data available for further analysis. Any tools which can automate this process will therefore save many hours of research time and increase the rate of new discoveries in what is a key area in understanding early human development. Here we present a series of techniques which can be applied to foetal cine-MRI scans in order to first locate and then differentiate between individual body parts. A novel approach to maternal movement suppression and segmentation using Fourier transforms is put forward as a preprocessing step, allowing for easy extraction of short movements of individual foetal body parts via the clustering of optical flow vector fields. These body part movements are compared to a labelled database and probabilistically classified before being spatially and temporally combined to give a final estimate for the location of each body part.

Revealing Latent Value of Clinically Acquired CTs of Traumatic Brain Injury Through Multi-Atlas Segmentation in a Retrospective Study of 1,003 with External Cross-Validation	MEDICAL IMAGING 2015: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 24-26, 2015	Orlando, FL	SPIE, ALIO Ind, Alpin Med Syst, Modus Med Devices Inc, Bruker, American Assoc Physicists Med, American Physiolog Soc, Comp Assisted Radiol & Surg, Med Image Percept Soc, Radiolog Soc N America, Soc Imaging Informat Med, World Mol Imaging Soc, DICOM Stand Comm		Traumatic Brain Injury; Multi-Atlas Segmentation; Computed Tomography; Machine Learning; Clinical Imaging	FUSION	Medical imaging plays a key role in guiding treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and for diagnosing intracranial hemorrhage; most commonly rapid computed tomography (CT) imaging is performed. Outcomes for patients with TBI are variable and difficult to predict upon hospital admission. Quantitative outcome scales (e.g., the Marshall classification) have been proposed to grade TBI severity on CT, but such measures have had relatively low value in staging patients by prognosis. Herein, we examine a cohort of 1,003 subjects admitted for TBI and imaged clinically to identify potential prognostic metrics using a "big data" paradigm. For all patients, a brain scan was segmented with multi-atlas labeling, and intensity/volume/texture features were computed in a localized manner. In a 10-fold cross-validation approach, the explanatory value of the image-derived features is assessed for length of hospital stay (days), discharge disposition (five point scale from death to return home), and the Rancho Los Amigos functional outcome score (Rancho Score). Image-derived features increased the predictive R-2 to 0.38 (from 0.18) for length of stay, to 0.51 (from 0.4) for discharge disposition, and to 0.31 (from 0.16) for Rancho Score (over models consisting only of non-imaging admission metrics, but including positive/negative radiological CT findings). This study demonstrates that high volume retrospective analysis of clinical imaging data can reveal imaging signatures with prognostic value. These targets are suited for follow-up validation and represent targets for future feature selection efforts. Moreover, the increase in prognostic value would improve staging for intervention assessment and provide more reliable guidance for patients.

Direct volume estimation without segmentation	MEDICAL IMAGING 2015: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 24-26, 2015	Orlando, FL	SPIE, ALIO Ind, Alpin Med Syst, Modus Med Devices Inc, Bruker, American Assoc Physicists Med, American Physiolog Soc, Comp Assisted Radiol & Surg, Med Image Percept Soc, Radiolog Soc N America, Soc Imaging Informat Med, World Mol Imaging Soc, DICOM Stand Comm		Cardiac volume estimation; Direct estimation; Segmentation; Bi-ventricles	MOTION; MRI	Volume estimation plays an important role in clinical diagnosis. For example, cardiac ventricular volumes including left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) are important clinical indicators of cardiac functions. Accurate and automatic estimation of the ventricular volumes is essential to the assessment of cardiac functions and diagnosis of heart diseases. Conventional methods are dependent on an intermediate segmentation step which is obtained either manually or automatically. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming, subjective and highly non-reproducible; automatic segmentation is still challenging, computationally expensive, and completely unsolved for the RV. Towards accurate and efficient direct volume estimation, our group has been researching on learning based methods without segmentation by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Our direct estimation methods remove the accessional step of segmentation and can naturally deal with various volume estimation tasks. Moreover, they are extremely flexible to be used for volume estimation of either joint bi-ventricles (LV and RV) or individual LV/RV. We comparatively study the performance of direct methods on cardiac ventricular volume estimation by comparing with segmentation based methods. Experimental results show that direct estimation methods provide more accurate estimation of cardiac ventricular volumes than segmentation based methods. This indicates that direct estimation methods not only provide a convenient and mature clinical tool for cardiac volume estimation but also enables diagnosis of cardiac diseases to be conducted in a more efficient and reliable way.

US tissue characterization is challenging due to the presence of various types of image artifacts and dependence on the sonographer's skills. One way of overcoming this challenge is by characterizing images based on the distribution of the backscatter data derived from the interaction between US waves and tissue. The goal of this work is to classify liver versus kidney tissue in 3D volumetric US data using the distribution of backscatter US data recovered from end-user displayed B-mode image available in clinical systems. To this end, we first propose the computation of a large set of features based on the homodyned-K distribution of the speckle as well as the correlation coefficients between small patches in 3D images. We then utilize the random forests framework to select the most important features for classification. Experiments on in-vivo 3D US data from nine pediatric patients with hydronephrosis showed an average accuracy of 94% for the classification of liver and kidney tissues showing a good potential of this work to assist in the classification and segmentation of abdominal soft tissue.

Its stages are image selection, image filtering, ROI selection, feature parameterization, and classification. Each stage is modular and can be replaced with alternate methods. Thus, this framework is adaptable to a wide range of tasks. Our two preliminary clinical targets are hepatic steatosis and adenomyosis diagnosis. For steatosis, we collected US images from 288 patients and their pathology-determined values of steatosis (%) from biopsies. Two radiologists independently reviewed all images and identified the region of interest (ROI) most representative of the hepatic echo-texture for each patient. To parameterize the images into comparable quantities, we filter the US images at multiple scales for various texture responses. For each response, we collect a histogram of pixel features within the ROI, and parameterize it as a Gaussian function using its mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and skew to create a 36-feature vector. Our algorithm uses a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Using a threshold of 10%, we achieved 72.81% overall accuracy, 76.18% sensitivity, and 65.96% specificity in identifying steatosis with leave-ten-out cross-validation (p< 0.0001). Extending this framework to adenomyosis, we identified 38 patients with MR-confirmed findings of adenomyosis and previous US studies and 50 controls. A single rater picked the best US-image and ROI for each case. Using the same processing pipeline, we obtained 76.14% accuracy, 86.00% sensitivity, and 63.16% specificity with leave-one-out cross-validation (p< 0.0001).

Commonly, the optimization problem is regarded as one of the method of problem-solving in the real world. However, objective function is constructed by human and it must consider design variable and dimension. If design variable that should regard the noise in objective function, it is clear to contain the inefficient process that due to identify all the dimensions in the method of optimization that depends on the uniform random numbers. In this study, it is assumed that the selecting dimension and change of objective function value relate with make-decision and causal relationship, we simulated by using value function that is shown better performance in multi-armed bandit problems and describes human causal intuitions. Further, we compared conventional Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) to our ABC-Loosely Symmetric with Variable Reference (ABC-LSVR). From the obtained results, ABC-LSVR was shown a better performance.

However, many universities do not fully utilize the result of these questionnaires. Usually, traditional statistical tools such as average or standard deviation are used to analyze the questionnaires. Recently, more advanced statistical tools are available and many of them come from the field of machine learning. We thus tried to analyze the course evaluation questionnaire using the advanced statistical tools. In this paper, the questionnaires obtained at National Defense Academy of Japan were analyzed. This questionnaire has been conducted for 10 years history to more than thousand cadets, but the questionnaires have not been analyzed up to the present. This study analyzed and evaluated the reliability of the class questionnaire through the statistical analysis. As a result, potential factors and their relationship were discovered in a questionnaire using Structural Equation Modeling.

In contrast, it is still difficult for AI to seek the best solution of the facing situation in games with imperfect information. This is because with the imperfect information players need to change the way they fight against the other players depending on the strategies of other players. If a method to estimate the enemy strategy is established, it will be possible for AI to set its standards to determine its strategy against other players. Therefore in this study, we took mahjong as an example of complicated games with imperfect information, and by statistically analyzing mahjong play record called "Haihu", we proposed a new method to classify enemy strategy in mahjong from Haihu.

The majority of vehicle-based infrastructure sensing has assumed that the vehicle's speed profile is identical every time it passes over the asset of interest. Ultimately, however this technology will be most practical if damage detection schemes can be applied regardless of the speed of the vehicle. Thus methods must be designed to handle speed variability to make this method more practical. In this paper we investigate the effects of variable speed when monitoring infrastructure from the dynamic response of a passing vehicle, which we measure by placing accelerometers on the vehicle of interest. We have conducted a series of laboratory tests to study this phenomenon, in which a vehicle crosses over a scaled model bridge structure with a varying speed profile. We quantify the ability of several features to detect changes in the infrastructure, independent of the variable speed. We show that aligning signals to normalize for speed variability improves the classification results.

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that dimensionality reduction can benefit from label information, via a joint estimation of predictors and target variables from a lowf-rank representation. In the light of such inspiration, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction which simultaneously reconstructs the predictors using matrix factorization and estimates the target variable via a dual-form maximum margin classifier from the latent space. Compared to existing studies which conduct the decomposition via linearly supervision of targets, our method reconstructs the labels using nonlinear functions. If the hyper-plane separating the class regions in the original data space is non-linear, then a nonlinear dimensionality reduction helps improving the generalization over the test instances. The joint optimization function is learned through a coordinate descent algorithm via stochastic updates. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to both classification in the original space (no reduction), classification after unsupervised reduction, and classification using linearly supervised projection.

J	Clachar, SA				Clachar, Sophine A.			Identifying and Analyzing Atypical Flights by Using Supervised and Unsupervised Approaches	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Effective analysis of flight data is a prominent topic in the aviation industry, with flight data recorders containing vast amounts of information on flight safety violations and maintenance issues. A demand exists for innovative techniques to analyze flight data because predefined threshold criteria, such as exceedances, are often quite rigid and cannot encompass all types of safety issues. Further, the accumulation of flight data presents a big data problem, so that it is infeasible for humans to analyze the data manually in a reasonable time. Statistics show that many accidents and incidents in aviation are recurrent. Therefore, to mitigate potential safety issues, machine-learning algorithms can be trained to identify accident precursors. This research had two purposes. The first was to perform cluster analysis by using Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOMs) to identify unstable approaches that transpired at the Grand Forks, North Dakota, International Airport. The Cessna 172 model aircraft was used, and unsafe practices were identified without specifying predefined thresholds. The second purpose was to employ the analytical techniques asynchronously to address the big data problem. The validated results indicated that SOMs identified hard landings and unsafe low-level maneuvers and that some approaches that were high, fast, and steep would be harder to detect by using traditional flight safety analysis techniques.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can show these variations and therefore can be used as a supportive feature for a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The hippocampus has been known to be a biomarker for Alzheimer disease and other neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, it requires accurate, robust, and reproducible delineation of hippocampal structures. Fully automatic methods are usually the voxel based approach; for each voxel a number of local features were calculated. In this paper, we compared four different techniques for feature selection from a set of 315 features extracted for each voxel: (i) filter method based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; two wrapper methods, respectively, (ii) sequential forward selection and (iii) sequential backward elimination; and (iv) embedded method based on the Random Forest Classifier on a set of 10 T1-weighted brain MRIs and tested on an independent set of 25 subjects. The resulting segmentations were compared with manual reference labelling. By using only 23 feature for each voxel (sequential backward elimination) we obtained comparable state-of-the-art performances with respect to the standard tool FreeSurfer.

In the first phase, a set of sequential patterns are generated from multi-dimensional sequence data. We proposes a novel method for inducing multi-dimensional sequential patterns with the use of Hellinger measure. The importance of each sequential pattern is also calculated. In the second phase, the generated sequential patterns are used for classifying multi-dimensional sequence data. A number of theorems are proposed to reduce the computational complexity of generating sequential patterns. The proposed method is tested on some synthesized sequence databases.

Based on a brief survey of energy as a key concept in machine learning, and the Aristotelian concept of potentiality vs. actuality allowing for the study of energy and dynamics in language, we propose a field approach to lexical analysis. Until evidence to the contrary, it was assumed that a classical field in physics is appropriate to model word semantics. The approach used the distributional hypothesis to statistically model word meaning. We do not address the modelling of sentence meaning here. The computability of a vector field for the indexing vocabulary of the Reuters-21578 test collection by an emergent self-organizing map suggests that energy minima as learnables in machine learning presuppose concepts as energy minima in cognition. Our finding needs to be confirmed by a systematic evaluation.

Vibration signals obtained from faults in inner race, outer race, rolling element and combined faults are considered. Raw vibration signal cannot be used directly since vibration signals are masked by noise. To overcome this difficulty combined time frequency domain method such as wavelet transform is used. Further wavelet selection criteria based on minimum permutation entropy is employed to select most appropriate base wavelet. Statistical features from selected wavelet coefficients are calculated to form feature vector. To reduce size of feature vector information gain attribute selection method is employed. Modified feature set is fed in to machine learning algorithm such as random forest and self-organizing map for getting maximize fault identification efficiency. Results obtained revealed that attribute selection method shows improvement in fault identification accuracy of bearing components.

Large numbers of machine learning algorithms were proposed by various researchers to model operational and functional changes in structures; however, a limited number of studies were applied to actual measurement data due to limited access to the long term measurement data of structures and lack of access to the damaged states of structures. By monitoring the structure during construction and reviewing the effect of construction events on the measurement data, this study introduces a new approach to detect and eventually classify anomalies during construction and after construction. First, the implementation procedure of the sensory network that develops while the bridge is being built and its current status will be detailed. Second, the proposed anomaly detection algorithm will be applied on the collected data and finally, detected anomalies will be validated against the archived construction events.

Manually defining signal features, as the common way, unfortunately will lose most of the information and the performance can't be guaranteed. In the past few years, machine learning method with deep structure has been the most promising automatic feature extracting method which has made great breakthrough in computer vision and automatic speech recognition. In this paper, deep belief networks are employed using vibration signal obtained from end milling to build feature space for cutting states monitoring. Greedy layer-wise strategy is adopted to pre-train the network and standard samples are used for fine-tuning by applying back-propagation method. Comparisons are made with several manually defined features both in time and frequency domain, like MFCC and wavelet method. Different modeling methods are also employed in the research for comparisons. Results show that the deep learning method has similar ability to characterize the signal for cutting states monitoring compared to those manually defined features. And the modeling accuracy is much better than other traditional modeling methods. Furthermore, benefitting from the potential capability in information fusion, deep learning method would be a promising solution for more complex applications, like tool wear monitoring, machining surface prediction et al.

It was demonstrated by many independent researchers that DBNNs exhibit superior performance to other known machine learning frameworks in terms of speech recognition accuracy. Their superiority comes from the fact that these are deep learning networks. However, a trained DBNN is simply a feed-forward network with no internal memory, unlike Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) which are Turing complete and do posses internal memory, thus allowing them to make use of longer context. In this paper, an experiment is performed to make a hybrid of a DBNN with an advanced bidirectional RNN used to process its output. Results show that the use of the new DBNN-BLSTM hybrid as the acoustic model for the Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) increases word recognition accuracy. However, the new model has many parameters and in some cases it may suffer performance issues in real-time applications.

Several prediction models have been proposed to estimate a therapeutic dose for patients. The models are either clinical models which contain clinical and demographic variables or pharmacogenetic models which additionally contain the genetic variables. In this paper, a new methodology for warfarin dosing is proposed. The patients are initially classified into two classes. The first class contains patients who require doses of >30 mg/wk and the second class contains patients who require doses of <= 30 mg/wk. This phase is performed using relevance vector machines. In the second phase, the optimal dose for each patient is predicted by two clinical regression models that are customized for each class of patients. The prediction accuracy of the model was 11.6 in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and 8.4 in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). This was 15% and 5% lower than IWPC and Gage models (which are the most widely used models in practice), respectively, in terms of RMSE. In addition, the proposed model was compared with fixed-dose approach of 35 mg/wk, and the model proposed by Sharabiani et al. and its outperformance were proved in terms of both MAE and RMSE.

Motivated by the rapid accumulation of PPI data in public database and the success stories concerning the targeting of PPIs, a machine-learning method based on sequence and structure properties was developed to access the druggability of PPIs. Here, a comprehensive non-redundant set of 34 druggable and 122 less druggable PPIs were firstly presented from the perspective of pockets. When tested by outer 5-fold cross-validation, the most representative model in discriminating the druggable PPIs from the less-druggable ones yielded an average accuracy of 88.24% (sensitivity of 82.38% and specificity of 92.00%). Moreover, a promising result was also obtained for the independent test set. Compared to other methods, the method gives a comparative performance, which is most likely due to the construction of a training set that encompasses less druggable PPIs and also the information of active pockets that have evolved to bind a natural ligand.

In this study, machine learning classifiers such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) analyses were used to classify 970 compounds based on their physicochemical properties, including quantum chemical descriptors, constitutional descriptors, functional groups and molecular properties. Good predictive performance was obtained from all classifiers, providing accuracies ranging from 82.47-89.61% for external validation set. SVM was noted as the best classifier, indicated by its highest accuracy of 89.61%. The analyses were performed on data sets stratified by structural scaffolds (nucleoside and non-nucleoside) and bioactivities (active and inactive properties). In addition, a molecular fragment analysis was performed to investigate molecular substructures corresponding to biological activities. Furthermore, common substructures and potential functional groups governing the activities of active and inactive inhibitors were noted for the benefit of rational design and high-throughput screening towards potential HCV NS5B inhibitors.

J	Dalvean, M				Dalvean, Michael			Ranking contemporary American poems	DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES			English	Article								The purpose of this article is to examine the linguistic differences between poems written by 'amateurs' and those written by 'professionals' and then to use these characteristics to rank a number of contemporary American poems. The corpus of poems used consist of 100 poems randomly selected from a recent anthology of professional poets and a control group of 100 poems written by amateurs. The poems were reduced to ninety-eight linguistic and psycholinguistic variables, and these were used in a machine learning algorithm to build an ensemble classifier. The accuracy of the classifier was 84.5%. The probability scores of the individual poems was then used to rank the professional poems on a continuum representing amateur at one extreme and professional at the other, thereby providing an objective means of ranking contemporary poems.

J	Volansky, V; Ordan, N; Wintner, S				Volansky, Vered; Ordan, Noam; Wintner, Shuly			On the features of translationese	DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES			English	Article							TEXTS	Much research in translation studies indicates that translated texts are ontologically different from original non-translated ones. Translated texts, in any language, can be considered a dialect of that language, known as 'translationese'. Several characteristics of translationese have been proposed as universal in a series of hypotheses. In this work, we test these hypotheses using a computational methodology that is based on supervised machine learning. We define several classifiers that implement various linguistically informed features, and assess the degree to which different sets of features can distinguish between translated and original texts. We demonstrate that some feature sets are indeed good indicators of translationese, thereby corroborating some hypotheses, whereas others perform much worse (sometimes at chance level), indicating that some 'universal' assumptions have to be reconsidered.

J	Odat, S; Groza, T; Hunter, J				Odat, Suleiman; Groza, Tudor; Hunter, Jane			Extracting structured data from publications in the Art Conservation Domain	DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES			English	Article								The most common method of publishing new discoveries about art conservation techniques and research has been through traditional full-text publications. Such corpora typically only support searching via metadata (e. g. title, authors, or keywords) and full-text. In particular, it is difficult to discover valuable information about the chemical processes, experimental results, or preservation treatments associated with the conservation of paintings from a specific genre. This article addresses this problem by focusing on the extraction of structured data (that complies with a pre-defined ontology) from a distributed corpus of publications about painting conservation. Our specific extraction method involves a unique combination of named entity recognition (using gazetteer-based and machine learning-based methods) followed by relationship extraction (using rule-based and machine learning-based methods). The resulting structured data are stored in a resource description framework triple store, and a Web-based graphical user interface enables the SPARQL querying, retrieval, and display of the search results. The results from applying our techniques to a corpus of publications on art conservation indicate that our approach achieves higher quality precision and recall in extracting named entities and relations from publications, relative to alternative existing approaches.

Deep learning is a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network algorithm. Deep learning has the advantage of approximating the complicated function and alleviating the optimization difficulty associated with deep models. Multilayer extreme learning machine (MLELM) is a learning algorithm of an artificial neural network which takes advantages of deep learning and extreme learning machine. Not only does MLELM approximate the complicated function but it also does not need to iterate during the training process. We combining with MLELM and extreme learning machine with kernel (KELM) put forward deep extreme learning machine (DELM) and apply it to EEG classification in this paper. This paper focuses on the application of DELM in the classification of the visual feedback experiment, using MATLAB and the second brain-computer interface (BCI) competition datasets. By simulating and analyzing the results of the experiments, effectiveness of the application of DELM in EEG classification is confirmed.

Though bearing such merits, existing ELM algorithms cannot efficiently handle the issue of missing data, which is relatively common in practical applications. The problem of missing data is commonly handled by imputation (i.e., replacing missing values with substituted values according to available information). However, imputation methods are not always effective. In this paper, we propose a sample-based learning framework to address this issue. Based on this framework, we develop two sample-based ELM algorithms for classification and regression, respectively. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted in synthetic data sets, UCI benchmark data sets, and a real world fingerprint image data set. As indicated, without introducing extra computational complexity, the proposed algorithms do more accurate and stable learning than other state-of-the-art ones, especially in the case of higher missing ratio.

RT Based Ensemble Extreme Learning Machine	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; SYSTEM	Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been well recognized as an effective learning algorithm with extremely fast learning speed and high generalization performance. However, to deal with the regression applications involving big data, the stability and accuracy of ELM shall be further enhanced. In this paper, a new hybrid machine learning method called robust AdaBoost. RT based ensemble ELM (RAE-ELM) for regression problems is proposed, which combined ELM with the novel robust AdaBoost. RT algorithm to achieve better approximation accuracy than using only single ELM network. The robust threshold for each weak learner will be adaptive according to the weak learner's performance on the corresponding problem dataset. Therefore, RAE-ELM could output the final hypotheses in optimally weighted ensemble of weak learners. On the other hand, ELM is a quick learner with high regression performance, which makes it a good candidate of "weak" learners. We prove that the empirical error of the RAE-ELM is within a significantly superior bound. The experimental verification has shown that the proposed RAE-ELM outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms on many real-world regression problems.

However, the success rate of the GPR systems are limited by operational conditions and the robustness of automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms embedded with the systems. In this paper an alternate ATR algorithm applicable to GPR is developed by combining image pre-processing and machine learning techniques. The aim of this research was to design a potential solution for detection of threat alarms using GPR data and reducing the number of false alarms through classification into one of the predefined categories of target types. The proposed ATR algorithm has been validated using a data set acquired by a vehicle-mounted GPR array. The data set utilized in this investigation involved greyscale GPR images of threat objects (both conventional and improvised) commonly found in realistic operational scenarios. Target based summaries of the algorithm performance are presented in terms of the probability of detection, false alarm rate, and confidence of allocating detections to a predefined target class.

Current approaches to mitigate these threats rely on highly trained operatives to reliably detect BEHs with reasonable false alarm rates using handheld Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and metal detectors. As computers become smaller, faster and more efficient, there exists greater potential for automated threat detection based on state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, reducing the burden on the field operatives. Recent advancements in machine learning, specifically deep learning artificial neural networks, have led to significantly improved performance in pattern recognition tasks, such as object classification in digital images. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in this work to extract meaningful signatures from 2-dimensional (2-D) GPR B-scans and classify threats. The CNNs skip the traditional "feature engineering" step often associated with machine learning, and instead learn the feature representations directly from the 2-D data. A multi-antennae, handheld GPR with centimeter-accurate positioning data was used to collect shallow subsurface data over prepared lanes containing a wide range of BEHs. Several heuristics were used to prevent over-training, including cross validation, network weight regularization, and "dropout." Our results show that CNNs can extract meaningful features and accurately classify complex signatures contained in GPR B-scans, complementing existing GPR feature extraction and classification techniques.

By detecting hazards using FLGPR, standoff distances of up to tens of meters can be acquired, but this is at the degradation of performance due to high false alarm rates. The proposed system utilizes an anomaly detection prescreener to identify potential object locations. Alarm locations have multiple one-dimensional (ML) spectral features, two-dimensional (2D) spectral features, and log-Gabor statistic features extracted. The ability of these features to reduce the number of false alarms and increase the probability of detection is evaluated for both co-polarizations present in the Akela MIMO array. Classification is performed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with lane-based cross-validation for training and testing. Class imbalance and optimized SVM kernel parameters are considered during classifier training.	[Shaw, Darren; Ho, K.

This complex translation process covers different phases, including instruction completion by adding obligatory information that is not explicitly given in human-oriented instructions. Robot action ontology is a common source of such additional information, and it is normally structured around a limited number of verbs, denoting robot specific action categories, each of them characterized by a certain action environment. Semi-manual action ontology building procedures are normally based on domain-specific human-language text mining, and one of the problems to be solved is the assignment of action categories for the obtained verbs. Verbs in English language are very polysemous, therefore action category, referring to different robot capabilities, can be determined only after comprehensive analysis of the verb's context. The task we solve is formulated as the text classification task, where action categories are treated as classes, and appropriate verb context as classification instances. Since all classes are clearly defined, supervised machine learning paradigm is the best selection to tackle this problem. We experimentally investigated different context window widths; directions (context on the right, left, both sides of analyzed verb); and feature types (symbolic, lexical, morphological, aggregated). All statements were proved after exploration of two different datasets. The fact that all obtained results are above random and majority baselines allow us to claim that the proposed method can be used for predicting action categories. The best obtained results were achieved with Support Vector Machine method using window width of only 25 symbols on the right and bag-of-words as features. This exceeded random and majority baselines by more than 37% reaching 60% of accuracy.

Radiometric calibration of digital cameras using Gaussian processes	OPTICAL SENSORS 2015	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Sensors	APR 13-16, 2015	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	SPIE		Radiometric calibration; flat field correction; digital imaging; Gaussian processes; dark current; bias value; vignetting; fixed pattern noise; photon noise; read noise; camera characteristic		Digital cameras are subject to physical, electronic and optic effects that result in errors and noise in the image. These effects include for example a temperature dependent dark current, read noise, optical vignetting or different sensitivities of individual pixels. The task of a radiometric calibration is to reduce these errors in the image and thus improve the quality of the overall application. In this work we present an algorithm for radiometric calibration based on Gaussian processes. Gaussian processes are a regression method widely used in machine learning that is particularly useful in our context. Then Gaussian process regression is used to learn a temperature and exposure time dependent mapping from observed gray-scale values to true light intensities for each pixel. Regression models based on the characteristics of single pixels suffer from excessively high runtime and thus are unsuitable for many practical applications. In contrast, a single regression model for an entire image with high spatial resolution leads to a low quality radiometric calibration, which also limits its practical use. The proposed algorithm is predicated on a partitioning of the pixels such that each pixel partition can be represented by one single regression model without quality loss. Partitioning is done by extracting features from the characteristic of each pixel and using them for lexicographic sorting. Splitting the sorted data into partitions with equal size yields the final partitions, each of which is represented by the partition centers. An individual Gaussian process regression and model selection is done for each partition. Calibration is performed by interpolating the gray-scale value of each pixel with the regression model of the respective partition. The experimental comparison of the proposed approach to classical flat field calibration shows a consistently higher reconstruction quality for the same overall number of calibration frames.

In order to build a burn classification model, training data that accurately represents the burn tissue is needed. Acquiring accurate training data is difficult, in part because the labeling of raw MSI data to the appropriate tissue classes is prone to errors. We hypothesized that these difficulties could be surmounted by removing outliers from the training dataset, leading to an improvement in the classification accuracy. A swine burn model was developed to build an initial MSI training database and study an algorithm's ability to classify clinically important tissues present in a burn injury. Once the ground-truth database was generated from the swine images, we then developed a multi-stage method based on Z-test and univariate analysis to detect and remove outliers from the training dataset. Using 10-fold cross validation, we compared the algorithm's accuracy when trained with and without the presence of outliers. The outlier detection and removal method reduced the variance of the training data from wavelength space, and test accuracy was improved from 63% to 76%. Establishing this simple method of conditioning for the training data improved the accuracy of the algorithm to match the current standard of care in burn injury assessment. Given that there are few burn surgeons and burn care facilities in the United States, this technology is expected to improve the standard of burn care for burn patients with less access to specialized facilities.

Deep convolutional neural networks for ATR from SAR imagery	ALGORITHMS FOR SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR IMAGERY XXII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XXII	APR 23, 2015	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Deep Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks; ATR; SAR; Machine Learning; Image Processing	CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	Deep architectures for classification and representation learning have recently attracted significant attention within academia and industry, with many impressive results across a diverse collection of problem sets. In this work we consider the specific application of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the MSTAR public release data set. The classification performance achieved using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on this data set was found to be competitive with existing methods considered to be state-of-the-art. Unlike most existing algorithms, this approach can learn discriminative feature sets directly from training data instead of requiring pre-specification or pre-selection by a human designer. We show how this property can be exploited to efficiently adapt an existing classifier to recognise a previously unseen target and discuss potential practical applications.

In a previous study, the available images were tracked manually through the image sets in order to explore renal microarchitecture. The purpose of the current research is to reduce the time and effort required to manually trace nephrons by creating an automated, intelligent system as a standard tool for such datasets. The algorithm is robust enough to isolate closely packed nephrons and track their convoluted paths despite a number of nonideal, interfering conditions such as local image distortions, artefacts, and interstitial tissue interference. The system comprises image preprocessing, feature extraction, and a custom graph-based tracking algorithm, which is validated by a rule base and a machine learning algorithm. A study of a selection of automatically tracked nephrons, when compared with manual tracking, yields a 95% tracking accuracy for structures in the cortex, while those in the medulla have lower accuracy due to narrower diameter and higher density. Limited manual intervention is introduced to improve tracking, enabling full nephron paths to be obtained with an average of 17 manual corrections per mouse nephron and 58 manual corrections per rat nephron.

Trading strategies are set regarding different technical indicators based on moving averages and volatility of the value and returns on stock indices. Simple trading rules are generated using two moving averages a long period and a short period moving average, and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Selected technical indicators are used as features in defining predictive model based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs). A LS-SVM classifier has been used in order to predict trend of the stock indices' value whereby the obtained outputs of the LS-SVM model are binary signals that can be used for defining the trading strategy. Comparing the results obtained from traditional statistical methods for predicting the trend of financial series and proposed LS-SVM model, it can be concluded that machine learning techniques capture the non-linear models which are dominant in the financial markets in more adequate way. Outperforming the results of Buy & Hold strategy and technical trading strategies, application of LS-SVM in decision making process on investing on the financial market significantly can contribute to maximization of profitability on investment.

Towards observation-based gridded runoff estimates for Europe	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE; FLOW DURATION CURVES; SOIL-MOISTURE; CATCHMENT CLASSIFICATION; MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; REGIONAL PATTERNS; PHYSICAL CONTROLS; UNGAUGED BASINS; RIVER DISCHARGE	Terrestrial water variables are the key to understanding ecosystem processes, feed back on weather and climate, and are a prerequisite for human activities. To provide context for local investigations and to better understand phenomena that only emerge at large spatial scales, reliable information on continental-scale freshwater dynamics is necessary. To date streamflow is among the best-observed variables of terrestrial water systems. However, observation networks have a limited station density and often incomplete temporal coverage, limiting investigations to locations and times with observations. This paper presents a methodology to estimate continental-scale runoff on a 0.5 degrees spatial grid with monthly resolution. The methodology is based on statistical upscaling of observed streamflow from small catchments in Europe and exploits readily available gridded atmospheric forcing data combined with the capability of machine learning techniques. The resulting runoff estimates are validated against (1) runoff from small catchments that were not used for model training, (2) river discharge from nine continental-scale river basins and (3) independent estimates of long-term mean evapotranspiration at the pan-European scale. In addition it is shown that the produced gridded runoff compares on average better to observations than a multi-model ensemble of comprehensive land surface models (LSMs), making it an ideal candidate for model evaluation and model development. In particular, the presented machine learning approach may help determining which factors are most relevant for an efficient modelling of runoff at regional scales. Finally, the resulting data product is used to derive a comprehensive runoff climatology for Europe and its potential for drought monitoring is illustrated.	[Gudmundsson, L.; Seneviratne, S.

To close this knowledge gap, in this article, six machine learning methods were compared for the specific task of sub-pixel land-cover extraction in the spatially heterogeneous region of Flanders (Belgium). In addition to the classification accuracy at the pixel and the municipality level, three evaluation criteria reflecting the methods' ease-of-use were added to the comparison: the time needed for training, the number of meta-parameters, and the minimum training set size. Robustness to changing training data was also included as the sixth evaluation criterion. Based on their scores for these six criteria, the machine learning methods were ranked according to three multi-criteria ranking scenarios. These ranking scenarios correspond to different decision-making scenarios that differ in their weighting of the criteria. In general, no overall winner could be designated: no method performs best for all evaluation scenarios. However, when both time available for preprocessing and the magnitude of the training data set are unconstrained, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) clearly outperform the other methods.

Comparing the performance of multispectral vegetation indices and machine-learning algorithms for remote estimation of chlorophyll content: a case study in the Sundarbans mangrove forest	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; LEAF-AREA INDEX; GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES; REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS; MODEL PERFORMANCE; EUCALYPTUS LEAVES; GLOBAL VEGETATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GREEN; OPPORTUNITIES	Optical vegetation indices (VIs) have been used to retrieve and assess biophysical variables from satellite reflectance data. These indices, however, also are sensitive to a number of confounding factors, such as canopy geometry, soil optical properties, and solar position. This suggests that VIs should be used cautiously for biophysical parameter estimation. Among biophysical variables, chlorophyll content is of particular importance as an indicator of photosynthetic activity. The goal of this study is to investigate the performance of multispectral optical VIs for chlorophyll content estimation in the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, and to compare these with machine-learning algorithms (MLAs). To this end, we have investigated the performance of 15 multispectral VIs and six state-of-the-art MLAs that are widely used for adaptive data fitting. The MLAs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (GPML), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Locally Weighted Polynomials (LWP), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). We use an in situ data set of reflectance and chlorophyll measurements to develop and validate our models. Each MLA was evaluated 500 times with random partitions of training and validation data. Results showed that the weight optimization and term selection used within GA produce the most reliable chlorophyll content estimation. However, green normalized difference VI (GNDVI) is a simple and computationally efficient VI that produces results that are nearly as accurate as GA in terms of model fit and performance. Results also show that all methods except ANNs and MARS produce a quasi-linear relationship between spectral reflectance and chlorophyll content. Statistical transformations of GNDVI and chlorophyll content have the capability of further reducing model error.

As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have better scalability and can achieve much better generalization performance and much faster learning speed compared with traditional SVM. In this paper, we introduce a multiclass AdaBoost based ELM ensemble method. In our approach, the ELM algorithm is selected as the basic ensemble predictor due to its rapid speed and good performance. Compared with the existing boosting ELM algorithm, our algorithm can be directly used in multiclass classification problem. We also carried out comparable experiments with face recognition datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can not only make the predicting result more stable, but also achieve better generalization performance.

In order to study this, people always extract features and use machine learning algorithms to do the prediction. But there are some disadvantages. Aiming at these deficiencies, we proposed a new feature, the dependency between the Weibos involved in geographical locations and location of the user. We use ELM to predict behaviors of users. An information dissemination prediction model has also been proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that our proposed new feature is real and effective, and the model we proposed can accurately predict the scale of information dissemination. It also can be seen in the experimental results that the use of ELM significantly reduces the time, and it has a better performance than the traditional method based on SVM.

A SCALED GRADIENT PROJECTION METHOD FOR BAYESIAN LEARNING IN DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						system identification; optimization methods; regularization; empirical Bayes method; marginal likelihood maximization	LEAST-SQUARES PROBLEMS; IMAGE-RESTORATION; IDENTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; RECONSTRUCTION; REGRESSION; SELECTION; MACHINE; CONVEX	A crucial task in system identification problems is the selection of the most appropriate model class and is classically addressed resorting to cross-validation or using order selection criteria based on asymptotic arguments. As recently suggested in the literature, this can be addressed in a Bayesian framework, where model complexity is regulated by a few hyperparameters, which can be estimated via marginal likelihood maximization. It is thus of primary importance to design effective optimization methods to solve the corresponding optimization problem. If the unknown impulse response is modeled as a Gaussian process with a suitable kernel, the maximization of the marginal likelihood leads to a challenging nonconvex optimization problem, which requires a stable and effective solution strategy. In this paper we address this problem by means of a scaled gradient projection algorithm, in which the scaling matrix and the steplength parameter play a crucial role to provide a meaningful solution in a computational time comparable with second order methods. In particular, we propose both a generalization of the split gradient approach to design the scaling matrix in the presence of box constraints and an effective implementation of the gradient and objective function. The extensive numerical experiments carried out on several test problems show that our method is very effective in providing in a few tenths of a second solutions of the problems with accuracy comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the flexibility of the proposed strategy makes it easily adaptable to a wider range of problems arising in different areas of machine learning, signal processing, and system identification.

In automobile industries, the traveling performance of the vehicle is tested at the design stage by simulating the vehicle response to various road excitations under different loading conditions. In this work, the disturbance from the road is assumed to be a dual bump. Initially, a FLC is designed to give better performance. Secondly, a flexible machine learning approach artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained with the FLC data by considering the performance measure as mean square error (MSE) is designed and used. At last, an ANFIS with the adaptive and generalizing features of ANN and intelligence of FLC is used for control purpose. In the modeling of system, simulation with and without controllers is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment. A comparison is made among the responses of the system with these controllers, and it shows that the system with FLC-based ANFIS gives significant reduction of the body acceleration (BA) and thus improves the traveling comfort.

In this paper, we present our results on the clustering of Stack Overflow users into four clusters, namely naive users, surpassing users, experts, and outshiners. This clustering is based on various metrics available on the forum. We use the X-means and expectation maximization clustering algorithms and compare the results. The results have been validated using internal, external, and relative validation techniques. The objective of this clustering is to be able to trace and predict the activity of a user on this forum. According to our results, majority of users (71 % of 40,000 users under consideration) fall in the 'experts' category. This indicates that the users in Stack Overflow are of high quality thereby making the forum an excellent platform for users to learn about computer programming.	[Anusha, J.; Sivakumar, P.

Thus, test inputs that were not seen in training are always given incorrect labels. Open set recognition algorithms address this issue by accounting for inputs that are not present in training and providing the classifier with an option to "reject" unknown samples. A number of such techniques have been developed in the literature, many of which are based on support vector machines (SVMs). One approach, the 1-vs-set machine, constructs a "slab" in feature space using the SVM hyperplane. Inputs falling on one side of the slab or within the slab belong to a training class, while inputs falling on the far side of the slab are rejected. We note that rejection of unknown inputs can be achieved by thresholding class posterior probabilities. Another recently developed approach, the Probabilistic Open Set SVM (POS-SVM), empirically determines good probability thresholds. We apply the 1-vs-set machine, POS-SVM, and closed set SVMs to FUR images taken from the Comanche SIG dataset. Vehicles in the dataset are divided into three general classes: wheeled, armored personnel carrier (APC), and tank. For each class, a coarse pose estimate (front, rear, left, right) is taken. In a closed set sense, we analyze these algorithms for prediction of vehicle class and pose. To test open set performance, one or more vehicle classes are held out from training. By considering closed and open set performance separately, we may closely analyze both inter-class discrimination and threshold effectiveness.

Most of the recent studies use the nuclear norm as a convex surrogate of the rank operator. However, all singular values are simply added together by the nuclear norm, and thus the rank may not be well approximated in practical problems. In this paper, we propose using a log-determinant (LogDet) function as a smooth and closer, though nonconvex, approximation to rank for obtaining a low-rank representation in subspace clustering. Augmented Lagrange multipliers strategy is applied to iteratively optimize the LogDet-based nonconvex objective function on potentially large-scale data. By making use of the angular information of principal directions of the resultant low-rank representation, an affinity graph matrix is constructed for spectral clustering. Experimental results on motion segmentation and face clustering data demonstrate that the proposed method often outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms.

As Grid computing is the ultimate solution believed to meet the ever-expanding computational needs of organizations, analysis of the various possible risks to evaluate and develop solutions to resolve these risks is needed. For correctly predicting the risk environment, we made a comparative analysis of various machine learning modeling methods on a dataset of risk factors. First we conducted an online survey with international experts about the various risk factors associated with grid computing. Second we assigned numerical ranges to each risk factor based on a generic grid environment. We utilized data mining tools to pick the contributing attributes that improve the quality of the risk assessment prediction process. The empirical results illustrate that the proposed framework is able to provide risk assessment with a good accuracy.

It was already demonstrated that a small set of residues at the interface, Hot-Spots(HS), contributes significantly to the binding free energy. However, these energetic determinants of affinity and specificity are still not fully understood. Moreover, the contribution of water to their HS character is also poorly characterized. In this review, we have focused on the structural data available that support the occlusion of HS from solvent, and therefore the "O-ring theory" not only on protein-protein but also on protein-DNA complexes. We also emphasized the use of Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) features in a variety of machine-learning approaches that aim to detect binding HS.

In order to overcome local minima apply evolutionary and population based methods like Genetic Algorithms and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO). The GA and TLBO is applied to solve the challenges of partitioning clustering method K-means like initial centroid selection and compare the results with using GA and TLBO. TLBO is latest population based method and uses a population of solutions to proceed to the global solutions and overcome the local minima problem.

Feature Subset Selection becomes an important preprocessing part in the area of data mining. Hence, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, and to improve the performance, document preprocessing, feature selection and attribute reduction becomes an important parameter. To overcome the problem of document preprocessing, feature selection and attribute reduction, a theoretic framework based on hybrid Information gain-rough set (IG-RS) model is proposed. In this paper, firstly the document preprocessing is prepared; secondly an information gain is used to rank the importance of the feature.

This paper presents GeoMesa, a distributed spatio-temporal database built on top of Hadoop and column-family databases such as Accumulo and HBase, that includes a suite of tools for indexing, managing and analyzing both vector and raster data. The indexing techniques use space filling curves to map multidimensional data to the single lexicographic list managed by the underlying distributed database. In contrast to traditional non-distributed RDBMS, GeoMesa is capable of scaling horizontally by adding more resources at runtime; the index rebalances across the additional resources. In the raster domain, GeoMesa leverages Accumulo's server-side iterators and aggregators to perform raster interpolation and associative map algebra operations in parallel at query time. The paper concludes with two geo-time data fusion examples: using GeoMesa to aggregate Twitter data by keywords; and georegistration to drape full-motion video (FMV) over terrain.

In this paper, we propose a novel system for image based roof style classification using machine learning technique. Our system is capable of accurately recognizing four individual roof styles and a complex roof which is composed of multiple parts. We make several novel contributions in this paper. First, we propose an algorithm that segments a complex roof to parts which enable our system to recognize the entire roof based on recognition of each part. Second, to better characterize a roof image, we design a new feature extracted from a roof edge image. We demonstrate that this feature has much better performance compared to recognition results generated by Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). Finally, to generate a classifier, we propose a learning scheme that trains the classifier using both synthetic and real roof images. Experiment results show that our classifier performs well on several test collections.

The Application of Machine Learning in Multi Sensor Data Fusion for Activity Recognition in Mobile Device Space	IMAGE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES: MATERIALS, DEVICES, SYSTEMS, AND APPLICATIONS II	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Sensing Technologies - Materials, Devices, Systems, and Applications II	APR 22-23, 2015	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Activity Recognition; Mobile phone; Mobile Sensors; Gyroscope; Accelerometer; Multi Sensor		The present generation of mobile handheld devices comes equipped with a large number of sensors. The key sensors include the Ambient Light Sensor, Proximity Sensor, Gyroscope, Compass and the Accelerometer. Many mobile applications are driven based on the readings obtained from either one or two of these sensors. However the presence of multiple-sensors will enable the determination of more detailed activities that are carried out by the user of a mobile device, thus enabling smarter mobile applications to be developed that responds more appropriately to user behavior and device usage. In the proposed research we use recent advances in machine learning to fuse together the data obtained from all key sensors of a mobile device. We investigate the possible use of single and ensemble classifier based approaches to identify a mobile device's behavior in the space it is present. Feature selection algorithms are used to remove non-discriminant features that often lead to poor classifier performance. As the sensor readings are noisy and include a significant proportion of missing values and outliers, we use machine learning based approaches to clean the raw data obtained from the sensors, before use. Based on selected practical case studies, we demonstrate the ability to accurately recognize device behavior based on multi-sensor data fusion.

Illumination Modelling of a Mobile Device Environment for Effective use in Driving Mobile Apps	IMAGE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES: MATERIALS, DEVICES, SYSTEMS, AND APPLICATIONS II	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Sensing Technologies - Materials, Devices, Systems, and Applications II	APR 22-23, 2015	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Ambient Light Sensor; Mobile Handheld Devices; Illumination Modelling; Regression Analysis; Machine Learning		The present generation of Ambient Light Sensors (ALS) of a mobile handheld device suffer from two practical shortcomings. The ALSs are narrow angle, i.e. they respond effectively only within a narrow angle of operation and there is a latency of operation. As a result mobile applications that operate based on the ALS readings could perform sub-optimally especially when operated in environments with non-uniform illumination. The applications will either adopt with unacceptable levels of latency or/and may demonstrate a discrete nature of operation. In this paper we propose a framework to predict the ambient illumination of an environment in which a mobile device is present. The predictions are based on an illumination model that is developed based on a small number of readings taken during an application calibration stage. We use a machine learning based approach in developing the models. Five different regression models were developed, implemented and compared based on Polynomial, Gaussian, Sum of Sine, Fourier and Smoothing Spline functions. Approaches to remove noisy data, missing values and outliers were used prior to the modelling stage to remove their negative effects on modelling. The prediction accuracy for all models were found to be above 0.99 when measured using R-Squared test with the best performance being from Smoothing Spline. In this paper we will discuss mathematical complexity of each model and investigate how to make compromises in finding the best model.

This fact has motivated numerous static and dynamic techniques to alleviate such threat. Building on this existing literature, this work introduces the design and evaluation of ADAM, a system that uses machine-learning over network metadata derived from the sandboxed execution of webpage content. ADAM aims at detecting malicious webpages and identifying the type of vulnerability using simple set of features as well. Machine-trained models are not novel in this problem space. Instead, it is the dynamic network artifacts (and their subsequent feature representations) collected during rendering that are the greatest contribution of this work. Using a real-world operational dataset that includes different type of malice behavior, our results show that dynamic cheap network artifacts can be used effectively to detect most types of vulnerabilities achieving an accuracy reaching 96 %. The system was also able to identify the type of a detected vulnerability with high accuracy achieving an exact match in 91% of the cases. We identify the main vulnerabilities that require improvement, and suggest directions to extend this work to practical contexts.

This approach is powerful but has some problems associated with it, of which the design of the membership function is the most serious. There are many different techniques for optimizing fuzzy clustering, including those based on similarity decomposition and centroids of clusters. Furthermore, the problem of overlap clustering is still being studied to improve its performance, especially with respect to the membership optimization. Rough set theory (RST) is the complement of fuzzy set theory and evidence theory, which use different techniques to address the uncertainty problem in overlap clustering. Considering the simplicity of the membership computation in RST, we propose an overlap clustering algorithm, which involves the use of the discernibility concept of RST to improve the overlap clusters as an existing variant of the overlap clustering algorithm. The experiment described here demonstrates that this new method improves the performance and increases the accuracy of clustering while avoiding the time complexity problem. The experiment uses five UCI machine learning datasets. The complexity of the data is measured using the volume of the overlap region and feature efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other two methods in terms of the Dunn index, the sum of the squared errors and the silhouette index.

To date a number of recommendation algorithms have been proposed, where collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are the two most famous and adopted recommendation techniques. Moreover, machine learning classifiers can be used for recommendation by training them on items' content information. These systems suffer from scalability, data sparsity, over specialisation, and cold-start problems resulting in poor quality recommendations and reduced coverage. Hybrid recommender systems combine individual systems to avoid certain aforementioned limitations of these systems. In this paper, we proposed unique generalised switching hybrid recommendation algorithms that combine machine learning classifiers with the collaborative filtering recommender systems. We also provide various variants of the proposed algorithm by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based recommendations, utilising SVD over collaborative filtering, and utilising SVD combined with Expected Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Experimental results on two different datasets, show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and provide better performance - in terms of accuracy and coverage - than other algorithms while at the same time eliminate some recorded problems with the recommender systems.

J	Hu, F; Shi, J				Hu, Feng; Shi, Jin			Neighborhood Hypergraph Based Classification Algorithm for Incomplete Information System	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ROUGH SETS; HYPERNETWORKS	The problem of classification in incomplete information system is a hot issue in intelligent information processing. Hypergraph is a new intelligent method for machine learning. However, it is hard to process the incomplete information system by the traditional hypergraph, which is due to two reasons: (1) the hyperedges are generated randomly in traditional hypergraphmodel; (2) the existing methods are unsuitable to deal with incomplete information system, for the sake of missing values in incomplete information system. In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm for incomplete information system based on hypergraph model and rough set theory. Firstly, we initialize the hypergraph. Second, we classify the training set by neighborhood hypergraph. Third, under the guidance of rough set, we replace the poor hyperedges. After that, we can obtain a good classifier. The proposed approach is tested on 15 data sets from UCI machine learning repository. Furthermore, it is compared with some existing methods, such as C4.5, SVM, NavieBayes, and KNN. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance via Precision, Recall, AUC, and F-measure.

These upper bounds are tight at the current estimate, and each iteration monotonically drives the objective function downhill. Such a simple principle is widely applicable and has been very popular in various scientific fields, especially in signal processing and statistics. We propose an incremental majorization-minimization scheme for minimizing a large sum of continuous functions, a problem of utmost importance in machine learning. We present convergence guarantees for nonconvex and convex optimization when the upper bounds approximate the objective up to a smooth error; we call such upper bounds "first-order surrogate functions." More precisely, we study asymptotic stationary point guarantees for nonconvex problems, and for convex ones, we provide convergence rates for the expected objective function value. We apply our scheme to composite optimization and obtain a new incremental proximal gradient algorithm with linear convergence rate for strongly convex functions. Our experiments show that our method is competitive with the state of the art for solving machine learning problems such as logistic regression when the number of training samples is large enough, and we demonstrate its usefulness for sparse estimation with nonconvex penalties.

In particular, a periodic track appraisal based on behavior is introduced that uses elementary topological data analysis coupled with basic machine learning techniques. The track appraisal adjusts the traditional kinematic data association likelihood (i.e., track score) using an established formulation for classification-aided data association. The proposed method is tested and demonstrated on synthetic vehicular data representing an urban traffic scene generated by the Simulation of Urban Mobility package. The vehicles in the scene exhibit different driving behaviors. The proposed method distinguishes those behaviors and shows improved data association decisions relative to a conventional, kinematic MHT.

The results are achieved by employing methods based on an array of machine learning classifiers such as AdaBoost, random forests, neural network, and support vector machines. To achieve effective classification performance, we seek to find a more reliable approach to pick authentic vibrations of vehicle engines from a trustworthy surface. Compared with vibrations directly taken from the uncooperative vehicle surfaces that are rigidly connected to the engines, these vibrations are much weaker in magnitudes. In this work we conducted a systematic study on different types of objects. We tested different types of engines ranging from electric shavers, electric fans, and coffee machines among different surfaces such as a white board, cement wall, and steel case to investigate the characteristics of the LDV signals of these surfaces, in both the time and spectral domains.

Medical imaging has become an indispensable tool for its diagnosis and follow up. During the last decade, the medical community has promoted to incorporate Ultra-Sound (US) screening as part of the standard routine. The main reason for using US imaging is its capability to differentiate benign from malignant masses, when compared to other imaging techniques. The increasing usage of US imaging encourages the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems applied to Breast Ultra-Sound (BUS) images. However accurate delineations of the lesions and structures of the breast are essential for CAD systems in order to extract information needed to perform diagnosis. This article proposes a highly modular and flexible framework for segmenting lesions and tissues present in BUS images. The proposal takes advantage of optimization strategies using super-pixels and high-level descriptors, which are analogous to the visual cues used by radiologists. Qualitative and quantitative results are provided stating a performance within the range of the state-of-the-art.

It permits to spot patterns within noisy sensor data in real-time in resource constrained sensor nodes. It allows variability in the sensed system dynamics through warping; it uses only integer operations; it can be applied to various sensor modalities; and it is suitable for embedded training to recognize new patterns. We illustrate the method on 3 applications from wearable sensing and activity recognition using 3 sensor modalities: spotting the QRS complex in ECG, recognizing gestures in everyday life, and analyzing beach volleyball. We implemented the system on a low-power 8-bit AVR wireless node and a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller. Up to 67 or 140 10-second gestures can be recognized simultaneously in real-time from a 10Hz motion sensor on the AVR and M4 using 8mW and 10mW respectively. A single gesture spotter uses as few as 135 mu W on the AVR. The method allows low data rate distributed in-network recognition and we show a 100 fold data rate reduction in a complex activity recognition scenario. The versatility and low complexity of the method makes it well suited as a generic pattern recognition method and could be implemented as part of sensor front-ends.

Gray-wolf optimizer is a new evolutionary computation technique which mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature. The aim of the gray wolf optimization is find optimal regions of the complex search space through the interaction of individuals in the population. Compared with particle swarm optimization (PSP) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) over a set of UCI machine learning data repository, the proposed approach proves better performance in both classification accuracy and feature size reduction. Moreover, the gray wolf optimization approach proves much robustness against initialization in comparison with PSO and GA optimizers.

However, there are several risks involved in using a cloud environment. To make the decision of migrating to cloud services there is a great need to assess the various risks involved. The main target of risk assessment is to define appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating those risks. We conducted a survey and formulated different associated risk factors to simulate the data from the experiments. We applied different feature selection algorithms such as Best-First, and random search algorithms methods to reduce the attributes to 3, 4, and 9 attributes, which enabled us to achieve better accuracy. Further, seven function approximation algorithms, namely Isotonic Regression, Randomizable Filter Classifier, Kstar, Extra Tree, IBK, multilayered perceptron, and SMOreg were selected after experimenting with more than thirty different algorithms. The experimental results reveal that feature reduction and prediction algorithms is very efficient and can achieve high accuracy.

In this paper, we propose an ensemble neural network algorithm to detect arrhythmia. Bagging approach with multilayer perceptron and radial basis neural networks is used to classify the standard 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in the cardiac arrhythmia database available in UCI Machine Learning Repository. The classification performance of the diagnostic model was analyzed using the following performance metrics, namely precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and area under the receiver-operating curve.

Therefore, security issues are prevalent and cannot be ignored. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to detect malicious behavior in network communication and hosts in real time. An open-source IDS widely in use is Snort, powerful IDS that can be configured by writing simple rules to detect a wide variety of hostile or suspicious network traffic. But IDS alone cannot effectively analyze the security threats as they have high rates of false alerts. Several machine learning and neural network algorithms have been tested on available datasets, and it has been proved that these algorithms help reduce false alerts up to a large extent. In this paper, we propose a way to bridge the gap between intrusion detection system benchmarking and real-world attacks by making use of effective and efficient algorithms.	[Akshay, M.

But providing such interworking among wireless heterogeneous networks and routing the selected traffic to particular wireless interface is a key challenge. Currently, existing algorithms are simple and proprietary, and there is no support to route the specific application traffic automatically. The proposed decision algorithm finds the optimal network by combining fuzzy logic system with multiple-attribute decision-making and uses naive Bayes classifier to classify the application traffic to route into appropriate interface to reduce the service cost. The performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithm efficiently uses the network resources by maintaining active connection simultaneously with 3G and Wi-Fi. It routes 71.99 % of application traffic using Wi-Fi network and 28.008 % of application traffic using UMTS network to reduce the service cost and to reduce network load on the cellular operator.

Since it is not possible to compromise on security, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) become critical component in a secure organization. IDSs detect an attack only after it has occurred. When use in a high-traffic network, IDSs produce a large number of alerts. The false-positive (FP) rate increases with this. In this paper, we propose a framework for predicting future attacks by combining two machine-learning methods: genetic algorithm (GA) and hidden Markov model (HMM). It has two major components in which the first component makes use of GA to derive efficient intrusion detection rules and thereafter a precise detection of attacks. The second component uses HMM to predict the next attack class of the attacker. So combining these together is a good idea and gives a good intrusion prediction capability with reduced FP rate.

The development of a NER system for Odia using Support Vector Machine is a challenging task in intelligent computing. NER aims at classifying each word in a document into predefined target named entity classes in a linear and non-linear fashion. Starting with named entity annotated corpora and a set of features it requires to develop a base-line NER System. Some language specific rules are added to the system to recognize specific NE classes. Moreover, some gazetteers and context patterns are added to the system to increase its performance as it is observed that identification of rules and context patterns requires language-based knowledge to make the system work better. We have used required lexical databases to prepare rules and identify the context patterns for Odia. Experimental results show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than previous approaches.

The IPSO is based on the global search properties of the traditional PSO and focuses on the suitable balance of the investigation and exploitation of the particles in the swarm for effective solution. During IPSO iterations, with increase in possible generations, the search space is decreased. Motivated from successful use of IPSO in many applications, in this paper, it is an attempt to design a MLP classifier with a hybrid back propagation learning based on IPSO. The proposed method has been tested using benchmark dataset from UCI machine learning repository and performances are compared with MLP, GA based MLP and PSO based MLP.	[Kanungo, D.

Hence, a higher order network can be useful to perform nonlinear mapping using the single layer of input units for overcoming the drawbacks of the above-mentioned neural networks. In this paper, a higher order neural network called Pi-Sigma neural network with standard back propagation Gradient descent learning and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms has been coupled to develop an efficient robust hybrid training algorithm with the local and global searching capabilities for classification task.

Moreover, many contributions have been made in two directions: Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm optimization (PSO). But, some limitations in both the algorithms (complicated operator like crossover and mutation in GA and early convergence in PSO), are the major restricted boundaries for solving complex problems. In this paper, a hybridization of Particle swarm optimization and Genetic algorithm has been proposed with the back propagation learning based Multilayer perceptron neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown through a no. of simulation steps with the help of the benchmark datasets considered from UCI machine learning repository. The performance of the algorithm is compared with other standard algorithms to show the steadiness and efficiency as well as statically significant.

Web proxy caching is utilized to improve performance of the Proxy server. Web proxy cache reduces both network traffic and response period. In the beginning section of this paper, semi supervised learning method as an Expectation Maximization Naive Bayes classifier (EM-NB) to train from proxy log files and predict the class of web objects to be revisited or not. In the second part, an Expectation Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier (EM-NB) is incorporated with traditional Web proxy caching policies to form novel caching approaches known as EMNB-LRU and EMNB-GDSF. These proposed EMNB-LRU and EMNB-GDSF significantly improve the performances of LRU and GDSF respectively.	[Benadit, P. Julian; Francis, F.

Machine learning is the process of automatically discovering useful information in knowledgebase. It also provides capabilities to predict the outcome of future solutions. Case-based reasoning is a tool or method to predict error level with respect to LOC and development time in software module. This paper presents some new ideas about process and product metrics to improve software quality prediction. At the outset, it deals with the possibilities of using lines of code and development time from any language may be compared and be used as a uniform metric. The system predicts the error level with respect to LOC and development time, and both are responsible for checking the developer's ability or efficiency of the developer. Prediction is based on the analogy. We have used different similarity measures to find the best method that increases the correctness. The present work is also credited through introduction of some new terms such as coefficient of efficiency, i.e., developer's ability and normalizer. In order to obtain the result, we have used indigenous tool.

Based on the collaboration of The City College of New York and the Air Force Research Laboratory in the last several years, we have developed a bank of algorithms to classify different types of vehicles, such as sedans, vans, pickups, motor-cycles and buses, and identify various kinds of engines, such as Inline-4, V6, 1- and 2-axle truck engines Thanks to the similarities of the LDV signals to acoustic and other time-series signals, a large of body of existing approaches in literature has been employed, such as speech coding, time series representation, Fourier analysis, pyramid analysis, support vector machine, random forest, neural network, and deep learning algorithms. We have found that the classification results based on some of these methods are extremely promising. For instance, our vehicle engine classification algorithm based on the pyramid Fourier analysis of the engine vibration and fundamental frequencies of vehicle surfaces over the data collected by our LDV in the summer of 2014 have consistently attained 96% precision. In laboratory studies or well-controlled environments, a great array of high quality LDV measured points all over the vehicles are permitted by the vehicle owners, therefore extensive classifier training can be conducted to effectively capture the innate properties of surfaces in the space and spectral domains However, in real contested environments, which are of utmost interest and practical importance to military applications, the uncooperative vehicles are either fast moving or purposively concealed and thus not many high quality LDV measurements can be made. In this work an intensive study is performed to compare the performance in vehicle classifications under the cooperative and uncooperative environments via LDV measurements based on a content-based indexing approach. The method uses an iterative Fourier analysis and an artificial feed-forward neural network. As our empirical studies have suggested, even in uncooperative and contested environments, with adequate training dataset for similar vehicles, our classification approach can still yield promising recognition rates.

The spatial evolution of the melt pool was recorded and analyzed during several welding procedures. A machine learning approach was developed to classify welding defects. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction of the melt pool data. This enhances classification results and enables on-line classification rates close to 1 kHz with non-optimized code prototyped in Python. These results point to the feasibility of real-time defect detection.

Discover facts (data) about real entity and derive conclusions (information) from those facts and storing them for future use and reference (knowledge), is an art to get the true feeling and sentiment. In recent trend, knowledge discovery and knowledge management has been highly influenced by Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis provides contextual polarity of a document with respect to some issues or some topic. This paper contributes a new approach of deploying Artificial Neural Network and k-Mean algorithm for Sentiment Analysis. The approach incorporate the linguistic analysis of different components of a sentence(Adverb, Adjective, Noun, Verb) into a artificial neural network for supervised learning and k-Mean algorithm for unsupervised learning and the output (five cluster representing strong like, weak like, doubtful, weak dislike and strong dislike) from the network will not only simplify e-Discovery(rapid identification of potentially relevant data) solutions and opinion analysis system but also shown significant advancement from the previous research on this domain. The system not only classify documents and provide a relevant information but also optimizes steps of different techniques used for Sentiment Analysis and increases the performance (reducing memory and processor utilization) by modifying the deployed algorithms.

In the proposed method, direct raga classification without the use of note sequence has been performed using pitch as the primary feature. The primitive features that are extracted from the probability density function (pdf) of the pitch contour are used for classification. A feature vector of 36 dimension is obtained by extracting some parameters from the pdf. Since non-sequential features are extracted from the signal, artificial neural network (ANN) is used as a classifier. The database used for validating the system consists of 162 songs from 12 ragas. The average classification accuracy is found to be 89.5 %.	[Suma, S.

Their disruption leads to generation of inherited diseases. Therefore prediction of PPI is a challenging task. Machine learning has been found to be an appropriate tool for predicting PPI. Machine learning features generated from a set of protein hetero-complex structures were found to be a good predictor of PPIs. These machine learning features were used as training examples to develop Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) based PPI prediction tools. Among the important features the sequence based features related to sequence conservations and structure based features like solvent accessibility were found to have the maximum predictive capability as measured by their Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC value). The RF based predictor was found to be a better performer than the SVM based predictor for this training set.

The usage of all these technologies can easily aid in early detection of breast cancer as well as help other decision makers take the right decision on time and all the times. Of the main hot topics nowadays concerning executive managers and decision makers is measuring the similarity between objects. For better performance most organizations are in need on semantic similarity and similarity measures. This article presents mathematically different distance metrics used for measuring the binary similarity between quantitative data within cases. The case study represents a quantitative data of breast cancer patients within Faculty of medicine Cairo University. The experimental results show that the squared chord distance yields better with a 96.76 % without normalization that correlate more closely with human assessments compared to other distance measures used in this study.

An incentive based mechanism is devised as a means to encourage users to contribute to questions posed in the forum by allowing various users to Upvote and Downvote posts and answers. Though this provides the needed impetus to users to contribute quality content, oftentimes the reward mechanism is more biased towards questions on popular topics such as Java, html etc. Moreover simple questions-questions whose answer can be found in most textbooks or on the web-sometimes get a large number of votes due to a number of people finding the answer with the least amount of effort from their side. The downside of this is that quality questions-questions where the user has given thought to the topic, put in effort and which would require an effort from the answerer-is seldom answered or voted up. The investigations in this paper are oriented towards separating popularity from quality. We propose an iterative technique based on link analysis algorithms to separate the quality posts from the low quality ones even if the latter have a high number of upvotes. Such a scoring can be utilized for improving search and for highlighting good posts finding answers to which would enhance the knowledge level of the community as a whole. Experimental evaluations aligning the ranks produced with expert given ranks are promising. In two out of three cases the proposed approach had higher rank correlation with those of the experts as compared to ranks inferred through Stack Overflow assigned scores. Moreover examination of individual posts which refer to common questions illustrate that the proposed techniques have the ability to push down their scores even if Stack Overflow has assigned high scores.

It is estimated that 347 million people suffer from diabetes mellitus (DM), and almost 5 million are blind due to diabetic retinopathy (DR). The progression of DR can be slowed down with early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore our aim was to develop a novel automated method for DR screening. Methods. 52 patients with diabetes mellitus were enrolled into the project. Of all patients, 39 had signs of DR. Digital retina images and tear fluid samples were taken from each eye. The results from the tear fluid proteomics analysis and from digital microaneurysm (MA) detection on fundus images were used as the input of a machine learning system. Results. MA detection method alone resulted in 0.84 sensitivity and 0.81 specificity. Using the proteomics data for analysis 0.87 sensitivity and 0.68 specificity values were achieved. The combined data analysis integrated the features of the proteomics data along with the number of detected MAs in the associated image and achieved sensitivity/specificity values of 0.93/0.78. Conclusions. As the two different types of data represent independent and complementary information on the outcome, the combined model resulted in a reliable screening method that is comparable to the requirements of DR screening programs applied in clinical routine.

In addition to network measurement, which is always used by the existing geolocation methods, our geolocation model for Internet hosts is also derived by both routing policy and machine learning. After optimization with the GeoCop method, the geolocation databases of Internet hosts are less prone to imperfect measurement and irregular routing. In addition to three frequently used geolocation databases (IP138, QQWry, and IPcn), we obtain two other geolocation databases by implementing two well-known geolocation methods (the constraint-based geolocation method and the topology-based geolocation method) for constructing the optimized objects. Finally, we give a comprehensive analysis on the performance of our method. On one hand, we use typical benchmarks to compare the performance of these databases after optimization; on the other hand, we also perform statistical tests to display the improvement of the GeoCop method. As presented in the comparison tables, the GeoCop method not only achieves improved performance in both accuracy and robustness but also enjoys less measurements and calculation overheads.

Therefore, FXR agonists present as promising dyslipidemia and anti-diabetes agents. To identify novel FXR agonists, models were created from 144 known FXR agonists by naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) approaches. The predictive and reliable models were selected with Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) criterion (> 0.900 with 117 testing compounds). The top 4 models were validated with the external data (282 compounds having cell-free activities and 500 decoys). Two optimal FXR agonist models (one from the NB method and the other from the RP method) were obtained from the top models by further validation. A virtual screening campaign was conducted against our in-house compound library with the optimal models and produced 15 virtual hits, which were further confirmed with cell-based luciferase assays. Finally, we discovered two new FXR agonists. Molecular docking studies indicated that the two new FXR agonists have similar binding modes to the known FXR agonists. This work demonstrated that a machine learning approach with combined NB and RP methods was able to identify novel FXR agonists and that the approach could be applied in other lead identification processes.

This study investigated whether subjects undergoing such screening who are at risk of a CVE can be identified using automatic image analysis and subject characteristics. Moreover, the study examined whether these individuals can be identified using solely image information, or if a combination of image and subject data is needed. A set of 3559 male subjects undergoing Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial was included. Low-dose non-ECG synchronized chest CT images acquired at baseline were analyzed (1834 scanned in the University Medical Center Groningen, 1725 in the University Medical Center Utrecht). Aortic and coronary calcifications were identified using previously developed automatic algorithms. A set of features describing number, volume and size distribution of the detected calcifications was computed. Age of the participants was extracted from image headers. Features describing participants' smoking status, smoking history and past CVEs were obtained. CVEs that occurred within three years after the imaging were used as outcome. Support vector machine classification was performed employing different feature sets using sets of only image features, or a combination of image and subject related characteristics. Classification based solely on the image features resulted in the area under the ROC curve (A(z)) of 0.69. A combination of image and subject features resulted in an A(z) of 0.71. The results demonstrate that subjects undergoing lung cancer screening who are at risk of CVE can be identified using automatic image analysis. Adding subject information slightly improved the performance.	[de Vos, Bob D.; Wolterink, Jelmer M.; Wielingen, Geoffery V.

To make sense of this information, human interpretation is often essential. On the other hand, computer-based approaches can exploit information contained in the images by numerically measuring and quantifying specific visual features. Annotation of organs and other anatomical regions is an important step before computing more in depth numerical features on medical images. A texture-based organ classification algorithm that could be used to reduce the time required for annotating medical images is presented in this paper. The texture of organs is analyzed using a combination of state-of-the-art techniques: the Riesz transform and a bag of meaningful visual words. The effect of a meaningfulness transformation in the visual word space yields two important advantages that can be seen in the results.

However, a high percentage of the patients have cancer recurrence after surgery, which reduces overall survival rate. To achieve optimal efficacy of treating and managing Stage I NSCLC patients, it is important to develop more accurate and reliable biomarkers or tools to predict cancer prognosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate a new quantitative image analysis method to predict the risk of lung cancer recurrence of Stage I NSCLC patients after the lung cancer surgery using the conventional chest computed tomography (CT) images and compare the prediction result with a popular genetic biomarker namely, protein expression of the excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) genes. In this study, we developed and tested a new computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme to segment lung tumors and initially compute 35 tumor-related morphologic and texture features from CT images. By applying a machine learning based feature selection method, we identified a set of 8 effective and non-redundant image features. Using these features we trained a naive Bayesian network based classifier to predict the risk of cancer recurrence. When applying to a test dataset with 79 Stage I NSCLC cases, the computed areas under ROC curves were 0.77 +/- 0.06 and 0.63 +/- 0.07 when using the quantitative image based classifier and ERCC1, respectively. The study results demonstrated the feasibility of improving accuracy of predicting cancer prognosis or recurrence risk using a CAD-based quantitative image analysis method.

As one of the simplest machine learning algorithms, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier has been widely used in many classification problems. However, the k-NN classifier has a drawback that the majority classes will dominate the prediction of a new sample. To mitigate this drawback, efforts have been devoted to set weight on each neighbor to avoid the influence of the "majority" classes. As a result, various weighted or wk-NN strategies have been explored. In this paper, we explored an alternative strategy, called "distance weighted inside disc" (DWID) classifier, which is different from the k-NN and wk-NN by such a way that it classifies the test point by assigning a corresponding label (instead a weight) with consideration of only those points inside the disc whose center is the test point instead of the k-nearest points. We evaluated this new DWID classifier with comparison to the k-NN, wk-NN, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers by experiments on a database of 153 polyps, including 116 neoplastic (malignance) polyps and 37 hyperplastic (benign) polyps, in terms of CADx or differentiation of benign from malignancy. The evaluation outcomes were documented quantitatively by the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis and the merit of area under the ROC curve (AUC), which is a well-established evaluation criterion to various classifiers. The results showed noticeable gain on the polyp differentiation by this new classifier according to the AUC values, as compared to the k-NN and wk-NN, as well as the SVM and RF. In the meantime, this new classifier also showed a noticeable reduction of computing time.

In a lateral x-ray image of the cervical spine, degenerative changes are characterized by vertebral bodies that have indistinct boundaries and limited spacing between vertebrae. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to detect and localize degenerative changes in lateral x-ray images of the cervical spine. Starting from a user-supplied set of points in the center of each vertebral body, we fit a central spline, from which a region of interest is extracted and image features are computed. A Random Forest classifier labels regions as degenerative change or normal. Leave-one-out cross-validation studies performed on a dataset of 103 patients demonstrates performance of above 95% accuracy.

Computer-aided recognition of dental implants in X-ray images	MEDICAL IMAGING 2015: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) Conference at the SPIE Medical Imaging Symposium	FEB 22-25, 2015	Orlando, FL	SPIE, ALIO Ind, Alpin Med Syst, Modus Med Dev Inc, Bruker		dental implant recognition; implant segmentation; active contours; k-NN classifier; optimal edge detection	CONTOURS	Dental implant recognition in patients without available records is a time-consuming and not straightforward task. The traditional method is a complete user-dependent process, where the expert compares a 2D X-ray image of the dental implant with a generic database. Due to the high number of implants available and the similarity between them, automatic/semi-automatic frameworks to aide implant model detection are essential. In this study, a novel computer-aided framework for dental implant recognition is suggested. The proposed method relies on image processing concepts, namely: (i) a segmentation strategy for semi-automatic implant delineation; and (ii) a machine learning approach for implant model recognition. Although the segmentation technique is the main focus of the current study, preliminary details of the machine learning approach are also reported. Two different scenarios are used to validate the framework: (1) comparison of the semi-automatic contours against implant's manual contours of 125 X-ray images; and (2) classification of 11 known implants using a large reference database of 601 implants. Regarding experiment 1, 0.97+/-0.01, 2.24+/-0.85 pixels and 11.12+/-6 pixels of dice metric, mean absolute distance and Hausdorff distance were obtained, respectively. In experiment 2, 91% of the implants were successfully recognized while reducing the reference database to 5% of its original size. Overall, the segmentation technique achieved accurate implant contours. Although the preliminary classification results prove the concept of the current work, more features and an extended database should be used in a future work.

A lot of methods have been proposed to enable automated extraction of organ regions from volumetric medical images. However, it is necessary to adjust empirical parameters of them to obtain precise organ regions. This paper proposes an organ segmentation method using structured output learning. Our method utilizes a graphical model and binary features which represent the relationship between voxel intensities and organ labels. Also we optimize the weights of the graphical model by structured perceptron and estimate the best organ label for a given image by dynamic programming and dual decomposition. The experimental result revealed that the proposed method can extract organ regions automatically using structured output learning. The error of organ label estimation was 4.4%. The DICE coefficients of left lung, right lung, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, left kidney, right kidney, and gallbladder were 0.91, 0.95, 0.77, 0.81, 0.74, 0.08, 0.83, 0.84, and 0.03, respectively.

With the development of machine learning and intelligent computing, these images can be used to create Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, which can assist radiologists in analyzing image data in various ways to provide better health care to patients. This paper looks at increasing accuracy and reducing cost in creating CAD systems, specifically in predicting the malignancy of lung nodules in the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). Much of the cost in creating an accurate CAD system stems from the need for multiple radiologist diagnoses or annotations of each image, since there is rarely a ground truth diagnosis and even different radiologists' diagnoses of the same nodule often disagree. To resolve this issue, this paper outlines an method of selective iterative classification that predicts lung nodule malignancy by using multiple radiologist diagnoses only for cases that can benefit from them. Our method achieved 81% accuracy while costing only 46% of the method that indiscriminately used all annotations, which achieved a lower accuracy of 70%, while costing more.

To visualize the complete region of colon without residual materials, electronic cleansing (EC) can be used to perform virtual subtraction of the tagged materials from CTC images. However, current EC methods produce subtraction artifacts and they can fail to subtract unclearly tagged feces. We developed a novel multi-material EC (MUMA-EC) method that uses dual-energy CTC (DE-CTC) and machine-learning methods to improve the performance of EC. In our method, material decomposition is performed to calculate water-iodine decomposition images and virtual monochromatic (VIM) images. Using the images, a random forest classifier is used to label the regions of lumen air, soft tissue, fecal tagging, and their partial-volume boundaries. The electronically cleansed images are synthesized from the multi-material and VIM image volumes. For pilot evaluation, we acquired the clinical DE-CTC data of 7 patients. Preliminary results suggest that the proposed MUMA-EC method is effective and that it minimizes the three types of image artifacts that were present in previous EC methods.

We previously tested that methodology on image cases with some pathology where the organs were not distorted significantly. In this paper, we present an advancement of AAR to handle organs which may have been modified or resected by surgical intervention. We focus on MRI of the neck in pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). The proposed method consists of an AAR step followed by support vector machine techniques to detect the presence/absence of organs. The AAR step employs a hierarchical organization of the organs for model building. For each organ, a fuzzy model over a population is built. The model of the body region is then described in terms of the fuzzy models and a host of other descriptors which include parent to offspring relationship estimated over the population. Organs are recognized following the organ hierarchy by using an optimal threshold based search. The SVM step subsequently checks for evidence of the presence of organs. Experimental results show that AAR techniques can be combined with machine learning strategies within the AAR recognition framework for good performance in recognizing missing organs, in our case missing tonsils in post-tonsillectomy images as well as in simulating tonsillectomy images. The previous recognition performance is maintained achieving an organ localization accuracy of within 1 voxel when the organ is actually not removed. To our knowledge, no methods have been reported to date for handling significantly deformed or missing organs, especially in neck MRI.

The proposed approach combines several individual detections of organ-location with a group-wise organ-location calibration and correction to achieve an automatic and robust multiple-organ localization task. The essence of the proposed method is to jointly detect the 3D minimum bounding box for each type of organ shown on CT images based on intra-organ-image-textures and inter-organ-spatial-relationship in the anatomy. Machine-learning-based template matching and generalized Hough transform-based point-distribution estimation are used in the detection and calibration processes. We apply this approach to the automatic partitioning of a torso region on CT images, which are divided into 35 VOIs presenting major organ regions and tissues required by routine diagnosis in clinical medicine. A database containing 4,300 patient cases of high-resolution 3D torso CT images is used for training and performance evaluations. We confirmed that the proposed method was successful in target organ localization on more than 95% of CT cases. Only two organs (gallbladder and pancreas) showed a lower success rate: 71 and 78% respectively. In addition, we applied this approach to another database that included 287 patient cases of whole-body CT images scanned for positron emission tomography (PET) studies and used for additional performance evaluation. The experimental results showed that no significant difference between the anatomy partitioning results from those two databases except regarding the spleen. All experimental results showed that the proposed approach was efficient and useful in accomplishing localization tasks for major organs and tissues on CT images scanned using different protocols.

Many existing solutions to this problem guarantee safety by making the conservative assumption that any unknown portion of the map may contain an obstacle, and therefore constrain planned motions to lie entirely within known free space. In this work, we observe that safety constraints may significantly limit performance and that faster navigation is possible if the planner reasons about collision with unobserved obstacles probabilistically. Our overall approach is to use machine learning to approximate the expected costs of collision using the current state of the map and the planned trajectory. Our contribution is to demonstrate fast but safe planning using a learned function to predict future collision probabilities.

PREDICTING THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF A 2-DIMENSIONAL MESSAGE PASSING MULTIPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE BY USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						Support vector regression; neural networks; multiprocessors; message passing	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; INTERCONNECTION NETWORK; PARAMETERS; SELECTION; VALIDATION; REGRESSION; MODELS	2-dimensional Simultaneous Optical Multiprocessor Exchange Bus (2D SOME-Bus) is a reliable, robust implementation of petaflops-performance computer architecture. In this paper, we develop models to predict the performance measures (i.e. average channel utilization, average channel waiting time, average network latency, average processor utilization and average input waiting time) of a message passing architecture interconnected by the 2D SOME-Bus by using Multi-layer Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (MFANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). OPNET Modeler is used to simulate the message passing 2D SOME-Bus multiprocessor architecture and to create the training and testing datasets. Using 10-fold cross validation, the performance of the prediction models have been evaluated using several performance metrics. The results show that the SVR model using the radial basis function kernel (SVR-RBF) yields the lowest prediction error among all models.	[Akay, M. F.; Aci, C.

Corpora with extreme heterogeneity in terms of file formats, document organization, page layout, text style, and content are common. The absence of meaningful metadata describing the structure of online and open-source data leads to text extraction results that contain no information about document structure and are cluttered with page headers and footers, web navigation controls, advertisements, and other items that are typically considered noise. We describe an approach to document structure and metadata recovery that uses visual analysis of documents to infer the communicative intent of the author. Our algorithm identifies the components of documents such as titles, headings, and body content, based on their appearance. Because it operates on an image of a document, our technique can be applied to any type of document, including scanned images. Our approach to document structure recovery considers a finer-grained set of component types than prior approaches. In this initial work, we show that a machine learning approach to document structure recovery using a feature set based on the geometry and appearance of images of documents achieves a 60% greater F-1-score than a baseline random classifier.

Here, we investigate whether these sensors can replace an area image sensor for the purpose of tissue thickness measurements. Material and Methods As part of a subject study high dynamic range (HDR) images of three subjects were acquired with an area image sensor. To simulate a line sensor as realistic as possible single or multiple lines were extracted from these HDR images. Thereby, horizontally extracted lines correspond to a parallel orientation of the line sensor relative to the incident angle of a laser beam. Vertically extracted lines correspond to an orthogonal orientation. Then, optical features were determined and converted into a tissue thickness using a machine learning algorithm. Results For the tested subjects the worst root mean square error (RMSE) of the learning process was 0 : 385 mm. The best RMSE was 0.222 mm. For all subjects, the mean RMSE and the standard deviation of RMSE values decreases with a larger number of extracted lines. The orientation of the line sensor turned out to be important for the RMSE. Vertically oriented line sensors achieve lower RMSEs than horizontally oriented sensors because of the influence of the incident angle. Furthermore, the head-pose of the subject seems to be important for the accuracy. Conclusion Line sensors deliver comparable results to previously analysed area image sensors. Nevertheless, the scattering of the values is higher and the size and orientation of the sensor and the head-pose have an influence on the RMSE of the learning process. Therefore, line sensors are feasible for tissue thickness estimation but they are a trade-off between accuracy and speed.

In Persian, some words such as adverbs can freely be moved within a sentence without affecting its correctness or meaning. In this paper, we illustrate the robustness of dependency parsing against this particular problem by training two well-known dependency parsers, namely MST Parser and Malt Parser, using a Persian dependency corpus called Dadegan. We divided the corpus into two separate parts including only projective sentences and only non-projective sentences, which are corelated with the free word order property. As our results show, MST Parsing is not only more tolerant than Malt Parsing against the free word order problem, but it is also in general a more accurate technique.

Living in a cyber world, being infected by these malwares becoming more common. Nowadays the malwares attack especially by the trojan horse is becoming more sophisticated and intelligent, makes it is harder to be detected than before. Therefore, in this research paper, a new model called Efficient Trojan Detection Model (ETDMo) is built to detect trojan horse attacks more efficiently. In this model, the static, dynamic and automated analyses were conducted and the machine learning algorithms were applied to optimize the performance. Based on the experiment conducted, the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm has outperformed other machine learning algorithms with 98.2 % of true positive rate and with 1.7 % of false positive rate.

It caused loss millions of money and productivities in many organizations and users all over the world. Currently, there are many works related with worm detection techniques but not much research is focusing on worm response. Therefore, in this research paper, a new model to respond to the worms attack efficiently is built. This worm response model is called as eZSiber, inspired by apoptosis or also known as cell-programmed death. It is a concept borrowed from human immunology system (HIS), where it has been mapped into network security environment. Once the user's computer detects any indication of the worm attacks, the apoptosis is triggered. In order to trigger the apoptosis, security metrics plays a very important role in identifying the weight and the severity of the worm attacks. In this model, the static and dynamic analyses were conducted and the machine learning algorithms were applied to optimize the performance. Based on the experiment conducted, it produced an overall accuracy rate of 99.38 % using Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. This performance criteria result indicated that this model is an efficient worm response model.

Crime classification is one of the components in crime prevention. In this study, we proposed a hybrid crime classification model by combining Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm (codename ANN-ABC). The idea is by using ABC as a learning mechanism for ANN to overcome the ANN's local optima problem thus produce more significant results. The ANN-ABC is applied to Communities and Crime dataset to predict 'Crime Categories'. The dataset was collected from UCI machine learning repository. The result of ANN-ABC will be compare with other classification algorithms. The experiment results show that ANN-ABC outperform other algorithms and achieved 86.48% accuracy with average 7% improvement compare to other algorithms.

Therefore, this paper concentrates on a double treatment iterative improvement algorithm with intelligent selection on composite neighbourhood structure to solve the attribute reduction problems and to obtain near optimal reducts. The algorithm works iteratively with only accepting an improved solution. The proposed approach has been tested on a set of 13 benchmark datasets taken from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository in line with the state-of-the-art methods. The 13 datasets have been chosen due to the differences in size and complexity in order to test the stability of the proposed algorithm.

A semi-supervised classifier, based on the C4.5 decision tree algorithm and AdaBoost, is trained with ground-truth, manually labelled sequences of key body poses. Before calculating feedback features to be learnt, synchronisation of training and testing sequences -often incomplete and/or asymmetric- with a reference (the tutor or exemplary performance) is done. Finally, an algorithm for adaptation of a performance to that of the tutor is proposed, in order to further enrich the feedback delivered to the user. The proposed framework generates numerical feedback to the user and the main limitations of the proposed approach are discussed.

Recent findings have highlighted interesting patterns of alteration in resting-state activity at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. However, it has not been established whether RS-fMRI alterations may be of any diagnostic use at the individual patient level and whether parameters derived from RS-fMRI images add any quantitative predictive/classificatory value to standard cognitive tests (CTs). Methods: We computed a set of 444 features based on RS-fMRI and used 21 variables obtained from a neuropsychological assessment battery of tests in 29 MCI patients and 21 healthy controls. We used these indices to evaluate their impact on MCI/healthy control classification using machine learning algorithms and a 10-fold cross validation analysis. Results: A classification accuracy (sensitivity/specificity/area under curve/positive predictive value/negative predictive value) of 0.9559 (0.9620/0.9470/0.9517/0.9720/0.9628) was achieved when using both sets of indices.

The knowledge of the past can be useful for the future as traffic patterns normally follow a predictable pattern with respect to time of day, and day of week. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the prediction accuracy and speed of several supervised machine learning algorithms towards congestion identification based on six weeks real-world traffic data from August 1st, 2012 to September 12th, 2012 in the Maryland (MD)/Washington DC, and Virginia (VA) area. Our dataset consists of six months traffic data pattern from July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012, of which 6 weeks was used as a representative sample for the purposes of this study on our reference roadway -I-270 [2-4]. Our experimental data shows that with respect to classification, classification tree (Ctree) could provide the best prediction accuracy with an accuracy rate of 100% and prediction speed of 0.34 seconds. It is pertinent to note that variations exist respecting prediction accuracy and prediction speed; hence, a tradeoff is often necessary respecting the priority of the applications in question. It is also imperative to note from the outset that, algorithm design and calibration are important factors in determining their effectiveness.

There must be a general strategy used to transform raw signals into useful features, but representing this generalization in the context of our information extraction tool set is lacking. In contrast to Big Data (BD), Large Data Analysis (LDA) has become a reachable multi-disciplinary goal in recent years due in part to high performance computers and algorithm development, as well as the availability of large data sets. However, the experience of Machine Learning (ML) and information communities has not been generalized into an intuitive framework that is useful to researchers across disciplines. The data exploration phase of data mining is a prime example of this unspoken, ad-hoc nature of ML - the Computer Scientist works with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to understand the data, and then build tools (i.e. classifiers, etc.) which can benefit the SME and the rest of the researchers in that field. We ask, why is there not a tool to represent information in a meaningful way to the researcher asking the question? Meaning is subjective and contextual across disciplines, so to ensure robustness, we draw examples from several disciplines and propose a generalized LDA framework for independent data understanding of heterogeneous sources which contribute to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). Then, we explore the concept of adaptive Information resolution through a 6W unsupervised learning methodology feedback system. In this paper, we will describe the general process of man-machine interaction in terms of an asymmetric directed graph theory (digging for embedded knowledge), and model the inverse machine-man feedback (digging for tacit knowledge) as an ANN unsupervised learning methodology. Finally, we propose a collective learning framework which utilizes a 6W semantic topology to organize heterogeneous knowledge and diffuse information to entities within a society in a personalized way.

Glioma-derived cancer stem cells (GSCs) are tumor-initiating cells and may be refractory to radiation and chemotherapy and thus have important implications for tumor biology and therapeutics. The analysis and interpretation of large proteomic data sets requires the development of new data mining and visualization paradigms. Traditional machine learning techniques proved to be insufficient to interpret and visualize the available experimental proteomic data. To overcome these limitations, we will present novel approaches for the visualization, clustering and projection representation to unveil hidden data structures relevant for the accurate interpretation of biological experiments. These qualitative and quantitative methods are applied to the proteomic analysis of data sets derived from the GSCs. The achieved clustering and visualization results provide a more detailed insight into the expression patterns of chromosome 19 proteins.

In particular, supervised machine learning methods can be used to complete a partially known network by integrating various measurements. Two main supervised frameworks have been proposed: the local approach, which trains a separate model for each network node, and the global approach, which trains a single model over pairs of nodes. Here, we systematically investigate, theoretically and empirically, the exploitation of tree-based ensemble methods in the context of these two approaches for biological network inference. We first formalize the problem of network inference as a classification of pairs, unifying in the process homogeneous and bipartite graphs and discussing two main sampling schemes. We then present the global and the local approaches, extending the latter for the prediction of interactions between two unseen network nodes, and discuss their specializations to tree-based ensemble methods, highlighting their interpretability and drawing links with clustering techniques. Extensive computational experiments are carried out with these methods on various biological networks that clearly highlight that these methods are competitive with existing methods.

Recent publications provide evidence for tissue-specific miRNA target recognition. Several computational methods have been developed to predict miRNA targets; however, all of these methods assume a general pattern underlying these interactions and therefore tolerate reduced prediction accuracy and a significant number of false predictions. The motivation underlying the presented work was to unravel the relationship between miRNAs and their target mRNAs in CRC. We developed a novel computational algorithm for miRNA-target prediction in CRC using a Naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm, which is referred to as CRCmiRTar, was trained with data from validated miRNA target interactions in CRC and other cancer entities. Furthermore, we identified a set of position-based, sequence, structural, and thermodynamic features that identify CRC-specific miRNA target interactions. Evaluation of the algorithm showed a significant improvement of performance with respect to AUC, and sensitivity, compared to other widely used algorithms based on machine learning. Based on miRNA and gene expression profiles in CRC tissues with similar clinical and pathological features, our classifier predicted 204 functional interactions, which involve 11 miRNAs and 41 mRNAs in this cancer entity. While the approach is here validated for CRC, the implementation of disease-specific miRNA target prediction algorithms can be easily adopted for other applications too. The identification of disease-specific miRNA target interactions may also facilitate the identification of potential drug targets.

So it is very promising to identify circularRNA transcripts from de novo assembled transcripts obtained by high-throughput sequencing, such as RNA-seq data. In this study, we presented a machine learning approach, named as PredcircRNA, focused on distinguishing circularRNA from other lncRNAs using multiple kernel learning. Firstly we extracted different sources of discriminative features, including graph features, conservation information and sequence compositions, ALU and tandem repeats, SNP densities and open reading frames (ORFs) from transcripts. Secondly, to better integrate features from different sources, we proposed a computational approach based on a multiple kernel learning framework to fuse those heterogeneous features. Our preliminary 5-fold cross-validation result showed that our proposed method can classify circularRNA from other types of lncRNAs with an accuracy of 0.778, sensitivity of 0.781, specificity of 0.770, precision of 0.784 and MCC of 0.554 in our constructed gold-standard dataset, respectively. Our feature importance analysis based on Random Forest illustrated some discriminative features, such as conservation features and a GTAG sequence motif.

However, for applications such as situational awareness systems, the entirety of the available data dwarfs the amount permissible for a training set with tractable machine learning optimization times. Furthermore, the performance of any optimized system is highly dependent of the training set correctly and completely representing the entire data space of scenarios. In this paper we present a technique to characterize the entire data space to ascertain the key factors for representation and subsequently select a subset that statistically represents the correct mix of scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these characterization and subset selection techniques by using a genetic algorithm to optimize the performance of a gunfire recognition system.

While it can continue to be used as a toy example, the age of this dataset makes it all but useless for intrusion detection research and data mining. Many of the attacks used within the dataset are obsolete and do not reflect the features important for intrusion detection in today's networks. Creating a new dataset encompassing a large cross section of the attacks found on the Internet today could be useful, but would eventually fall to the same problem as the KDD-99 Cup; its usefulness would diminish after a period of time. To continue research into intrusion detection, the generation of new datasets needs to be as dynamic and as quick as the attacker. Simply examining existing network traffic and using domain experts such as intrusion analysts to label traffic is inefficient, expensive, and not scalable. The only viable methodology is simulation using technologies including virtualization, attack-toolsets such as Metasploit and Armitage, and sophisticated emulation of threat and user behavior. Simulating actual user behavior and network intrusion events dynamically not only allows researchers to vary scenarios quickly, but enables online testing of intrusion detection mechanisms by interacting with data as it is generated. As new threat behaviors are identified, they can be added to the simulation to make quicker determinations as to the effectiveness of existing and ongoing network intrusion technology, methodology and models.

Even though DTL offers a greater flexibility in extracting high-level features and enabling feature transference from a source to a target task, the DTL solution might get stuck at local minima leading to performance degradation-negative transference-, similar to what happens in the classical machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose the Source-Target-Source (STS) methodology to reduce the impact of negative transference, by iteratively switching between source and target tasks in the training process. The results show the effectiveness of such approach.

This paper presents an approach to address irony detection from a machine learning perspective. Our model considers structural features as well as, for the first time, sentiment analysis features such as the overall sentiment of a tweet and a score of its polarity.

Exploiting the Bin-Class Histograms for Feature Selection on Discrete Data	PATTERN RECOGNITION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS (IBPRIA 2015)	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis (IbPRIA)	JUN 17-19, 2015	Santiago de Compostela, SPAIN		Univ Santiago de Compostela	Feature selection; Feature discretization; Discrete features; Bin-class histogram; Matrix norm; Supervised learning; Classification		In machine learning and pattern recognition tasks, the use of feature discretization techniques may have several advantages. The discretized features may hold enough information for the learning task at hand, while ignoring minor fluctuations that are irrelevant or harmful for that task. The discretized features have more compact representations that may yield both better accuracy and lower training time, as compared to the use of the original features. However, in many cases, mainly with medium and high-dimensional data, the large number of features usually implies that there is some redundancy among them. Thus, we may further apply feature selection (FS) techniques on the discrete data, keeping the most relevant features, while discarding the irrelevant and redundant ones. In this paper, we propose relevance and redundancy criteria for supervised feature selection techniques on discrete data. These criteria are applied to the bin-class histograms of the discrete features. The experimental results, on public benchmark data, show that the proposed criteria can achieve better accuracy than widely used relevance and redundancy criteria, such as mutual information and the Fisher ratio.

Ultrasound images have been widely used for PNB procedure due to their low cost and because they are non-invasive. However, the segmentation of nerve structures in ultrasound images is a challenging task for the specialists since the images are affected by echo perturbations and speckle noise. Automatic or semi-automatic segmentation systems can be developed in order to aid the specialist for locating nerves structures accurately. In this paper we propose a methodology for the semi-automatic segmentation of nerve structures in ultrasound images. We use non-linear Wavelets transform in the feature extraction step and for the classification stage we use a Gaussian Processes classifier. Experimental results show that the implemented methodology can segment nerve structures accurately.

Applying Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) techniques allows us to examine the radar cross section (RCS) of humans and indoor clutter objects by utilizing different types of computer models. FDTD allows for the spectral characteristics to be acquired over a wide range of frequencies, polarizations, aspect angles, and materials. The acquired target and clutter RCS spectral characteristics are then investigated in terms of their potential for target classification using SVMs. Based upon variables such as frequency and polarization, a SVM classifier can be trained to classify unknown targets as a human or clutter. Furthermore, the application of feature selection is applied to the spectral characteristics to determine the SVM classification accuracy of a reduced dataset. Classification accuracies of nearly 90% are achieved using radial and polynomial kernels.

A Preliminary Study of Clinical Abbreviation Disambiguation in Real Time	APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Clinical abbreviation; machine learning; clinical documentation system	FAMILY-PRACTICE; MEDICINE; QUALITY	Objective: To save time, healthcare providers frequently use abbreviations while authoring clinical documents. Nevertheless, abbreviations that authors deem unambiguous often confuse other readers, including clinicians, patients, and natural language processing (NLP) systems. Most current clinical NLP systems "post-process" notes long after clinicians enter them into electronic health record systems (EHRs). Such post-processing cannot guarantee 100% accuracy in abbreviation identification and disambiguation, since multiple alternative interpretations exist. Methods: Authors describe a prototype system for real-time Clinical Abbreviation Recognition and Disambiguation (rCARD) - i.e., a system that interacts with authors during note generation to verify correct abbreviation senses. The rCARD system design anticipates future integration with web-based clinical documentation systems to improve quality of healthcare records. When clinicians enter documents, rCARD will automatically recognize each abbreviation. For abbreviations with multiple possible senses, rCARD will show a ranked list of possible meanings with the best predicted sense at the top. The prototype application embodies three word sense disambiguation (WSD) methods to predict the correct senses of abbreviations. We then conducted three experments to evaluate rCARD, including 1) a performance evaluation of different WSD methods; 2) a time evaluation of real-time WSD methods; and 3) a user study of typing clinical sentences with abbreviations using rCARD. Results: Using 4,721 sentences containing 25 commonly observed, highly ambiguous clinical abbreviations, our evaluation showed that the best profile-based method implemented in rCARD achieved a reasonable WSD accuracy of 88.8% (comparable to SVM - 89.5%) and the cost of time for the different WSD methods are also acceptable (ranging from 0.630 to 1.649 milliseconds within the same network). The preliminary user study also showed that the extra time costs by rCARD were about 5% of total document entry time and users did not feel a significant delay when using rCARD for clinical document entry. Conclusion: The study indicates that it is feasible to integrate a real-time, NLP-enabled abbreviation recognition and disambiguation module with clinical documentation systems.

In this paper, we analyse the Twitter content of an account owner and its list of followers through various text mining methods and segment the list of followers via an index. We have termed this index as the High-Value Social Audience (HVSA) index. This HVSA index enables a company or organisation to devise their marketing and engagement plan according to available resources, so that a high-value social audience can potentially be transformed to customers, and hence improve the return on investment.

Analysis of gene expression is important in many fields of biological research in order to retrieve the required information. As time progresses, the illness in general and cancer in particular have become more and more complex and complicated, in detecting, analyzing and curing. We know cancer is deadly disease. Cancer research is one of the major area of research in medical field. Predicting precisely of different tumor types is a great challenge and providing accurate prediction will have great value in providing better treatment to the patients. To achieve this, data mining algorithms are important tools and the most extensively used approach to achieve important feature of gene expression data and plays an important role for gene classification. One of major challenges is to discover how to extract useful information from huge datasets. This paper presents recent advances in the machine learning based gene expression data analysis with different feature selection algorithms. Gene expression profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular level, have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool. But compared to the number of genes involved, available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample size for classification. These training data limitations constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies. Feature selection techniques can be used to extract the marker genes which influence the classification accuracy effectively by eliminating the un wanted noisy and redundant genes This paper presents a review of feature selection techniques that have been employed in micro array data based cancer classification and also the predominant role of SVM for cancer classification.

In an automated machining environment monitoring of tool conditions is imperative. In this study, Experiments were conducted to classify the tool conditions during High Speed Machining of Titanium alloy. During the machining process, vibration signals were monitored continuously using accelerometer. The features from the signal are extracted and a set of prominent features are selected using Dimensionality Reduction Technique. The selected features are given as an input to the classification algorithm to decide about the condition of the tool. Feature selection has been carried out using J48 Decision Tree Algorithm. Classifications of tool conditions were carried out using Machine Learning Algorithms namely J48 Decision Tree algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). From the analysis, it is found that ANN is producing comparatively better results. The methodology adopted in this study will be useful for online tool condition monitoring. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Machine Learning Approach to the Prediction of Surface Roughness using Statistical Features of Vibration Signal Acquired in Turning	BIG DATA, CLOUD AND COMPUTING CHALLENGES	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Big Data and Cloud Computing Challenges (ISBCC)	MAR 12-13, 2015	Chennai, INDIA		VIT Univ	Surface roughness; vibration signals; statistical features; regression analysis; principle component analysis; machine learning	SYSTEM	Prediction of surface roughness is always considered important in the manufacturing field. A product may require a particular roughness that may be specified by the designer for various reasons, either functional requirement or aesthetic appeal. While modern manufacturing systems and machines have always contributed towards better control of surface quality, better computational facilities and the availability of newer algorithms attract researchers to understand the prediction of quality in a better manner. In this paper, prediction of surface roughness by multiple regression analysis is presented. The predictors are cutting parameters, tool wear and the statistical parameters extracted from the vibration signals of a turning centre. The contribution of various statistical parameters in prediction of surface roughness is studied. A Machine learning approach using feature reduction using principle component analysis is attempted to achieve higher predictability and low computational effort. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this work an attempt is made to correlate arc sound with the weld quality. The welding is done with various combinations of current, voltage, and travel speed to produce good welds as well as weld with defects. The defects considered in this study are lack of fusion and burn through. Raw data points captured from the arc sound were converted into amplitude signals. The welded specimens were inspected and classified into 3 classes such as good weld and weld with lack of fusion and burn through. Statistical features of raw data were extracted using data mining software. Using classification algorithms the defects are classified. Two algorithms namely, J48 and random forest were used and classification efficiencies of the algorithms were reported. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Now enormous videos are available on web and online to accessible from internet or retrieve videos from smart phones, digital cellular assistants. There is the drastic growth in the amount of multimedia field of improving data storage, acquisition and communication technologies, which are all supported by major improvements in processing of video and audio. Researches focused on more efforts in video retrieval that contain certain visual information rather than image of their interest. Such a search is facilitated by Content Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) methods. Specifically segmentation of video is the most prominent step as the retrieved results are based on the segmentation boundaries. The shot boundary detection can be performed using various different techniques like Motion/hybrid DCT, edge tracking, histogram, HSV Model, Motion vector and Block matching methods. This paper mainly presents a study of different methods/algorithm that has been proposed in literature for video retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between low and high level features. Semantic gap between these two feature level is improving by its efficiency with the help of advanced algorithms and techniques using machine learning with fusions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

For a noninvasive inexpensive ultrasonographic analysis, it is necessary to validate the quantitative assessment of liver fat content so that fully automated reliable computer-aided software can assist medical practitioners without any operator subjectivity. In this study, we attempt to quantify the hepatorenal index difference between the liver and the kidney with respect to the multiple severity status of hepatic steatosis. In order to do this, a series of carefully designed image processing techniques, including fuzzy stretching and edge tracking, are applied to extract regions of interest. Then, an unsupervised neural learning algorithm, the self-organizing map, is designed to establish characteristic clusters from the image, and the distribution of the hepatorenal index values with respect to the different levels of the fatty liver status is experimentally verified to estimate the differences in the distribution of the hepatorenal index. Such findings will be useful in building reliable computer-aided diagnostic software if combined with a good set of other characteristic feature sets and powerful machine learning classifiers in the future.

In this work, a computational model was developed to predict the compounds as BCRP inhibitors or non-inhibitors. Various machine learning approaches like, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to develop the models. The Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) of developed models using ANN, k-NN and SVM are 0.67, 0.71 and 0.77, and prediction accuracies are 85.2%, 88.3% and 90.8% respectively. The developed models were tested with a test set of 99 compounds and further validated with external set of 98 compounds. Distribution plot analysis and various machine learning models were also developed based on drug-likeness descriptors. Applicability domain is used to check the prediction reliability of the new molecules.

However, the task of studying the interactions is of many difficulties in case of the membrane proteins, due to their hydrophobic environment. This is why the use of bioinformatics methods, especially machine learning approaches is essential to understand the membrane proteins' function. However, the machine learning methods for prediction of the interaction sites of membrane proteins are faced with numerous challenges. This paper aims to describe the current state of machine learning applications in inferring the membrane protein interaction sites, and to assess the methods up to now proposed. We have introduced the membrane protein interaction site prediction methods, presented the contribution degrees of parameters at membrane protein interaction interfaces, and compared the performance of methods through several case predictions.

The feasibility of fMRI-NF in healthy subjects has been documented for a variety of brain areas and neural systems, and this technique has also been proposed for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in recent years. Through a systematic review of the scientific literature this paper probes the rationale and expected applications of fMRI-NF in psychiatry, discusses issues that must be addressed in the use of this technique to treat mental disorders. Six relevant references and five ongoing studies were identified according to our inclusion criteria. These studies show that in most psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, addiction), patients are able to learn voluntary control of the neuronal activity of the targeted brain region(s). Interestingly, in some cases, this learning is associated with clinical improvement, showing that fMRI-NF can potentially be developed into a therapeutic tool. However, only low-level evidence is available to support the use of this relatively new technique in clinical practice. Notably, no randomized, controlled trial is currently available in this field of research. Finally, methodological issues and clinical perspectives (especially the potential use of pattern recognition in fMRI-NF protocols) are discussed.

In practice, TCM provides a quite distinct methodology to patient diagnosis and treatment compared to western medicine (WM). Syndrome (ZHENG or pattern) is differentiated by a set of symptoms and signs examined from an individual by four main diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, interrogation, and palpation which reflects the pathological and physiological changes of disease occurrence and development. Patient classification is to divide patients into several classes based on different criteria. In this paper, from the machine learning perspective, a survey on patient classification issue will be summarized on three major aspects of TCM: sign classification, syndrome differentiation, and disease classification. With the consideration of different diagnostic data analyzed by different computational methods, we present the overview for four subfields of TCM diagnosis, respectively. For each subfield, we design a rectangular reference list with applications in the horizontal direction and machine learning algorithms in the longitudinal direction. According to the current development of objective TCM diagnosis for patient classification, a discussion of the research issues around machine learning techniques with applications to TCM diagnosis is given to facilitate the further research for TCM patient classification.

Here we demonstrate how the scattering pattern of a laser beam passing a two-phase flow under an oblique angle to the flow direction can be used to detect derivations from the desired flow conditions in microseconds. Applying machine-learning techniques to signals obtained from three photo-detectors we achieve a compact, versatile, low-cost sensor design for safety applications.

However, in real problems, we always have to run the algorithm for several times and use the best matrix factorization result as the final output because of the random initialization of the matrix factorization. In this paper, we proposed an improved non-negative matrix factorization algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA), which uses the internal parallelism and the random search of genetic algorithm to get the optimal solution of matrix factorization. It could have larger searching area and higher accuracy in matrix factorization. In the document clustering problem, we use the TDT2 dataset and design several contrast experiments on the classical NMF and the improved NMF based on genetic algorithm, the experiment results show that our improved non-negative matrix factorization algorithm has higher clustering accuracy and better robustness.

One of the classification algorithm is FNGLVQ that can be used to solve several types of classification problem in previous research. On the other side, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an instrument currently used in many application especially for portable smart device. In this paper we will discuss thoroughly about design and simulation of FNGLVQ algortihm on FPGA. FNGLVQ is an artificial neural network based algorithm that can be used for several applications in previous researches. The design consists of two major phases, training and testing phase. The design was implemented in Xilinx ISE Project Navigator which is an integrated development environtment (IDE) to build the design into the actual Xilinx FPGA. The IDE also provides simulation feature for the design. In this research, we use Iris dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning database. Simulation result shows that this design reached 90.00%, 93.33%, 93.33%, 83.33%, 80.00%, 83.00%, and 86.67% accuracy respectively for epoch value 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64. As comparison, FNGLVQ implemented in MATLAB constantly reached 93.33% accuracy for those variation of epoch.. However, running time on the FPGA side is approximately twenty time faster than on MATLAB side	[Daniel, Ricky A.; Ma'sum, M.

Modelling and predicting energy related magnitudes leads to analyse electric power consumption and can achieve economical benefits. In this study, machine learning techniques are applied to predict active power in buildings. The real data acquired corresponds to time, environmental and electrical data of 30 buildings belonging to the University of Leon (Spain). Firstly, we segmented buildings in terms of their energy consumption using principal component analysis. Afterwards, after test different univariate and multivariate techniques, we applied SVR and a learning FRBS method to compare their performance. Models were studied for different variable selections. Our analysis shows that the FRBS has the lowest error needing a similar learning time than SVR.

The particular case of one-day ahead stream flow forecasting is an important but difficult problem that has been increasingly studied using hybrid computational intelligence and machine learning techniques. However, these studies present several limitations. In this work we attempt to address those limitations by (1) replicating and validating previous works; (2) using more objective evaluation criteria; (3) applying several computational intelligence techniques to datasets representative of diverse geographic areas; (4) preprocessing data and performing an extensive parameter optimization in order to improve previous results.

In a first stage, we consider the new framework in standard situations, where both the collection of attributes and the response variables are observed with precision. In a second one, we assume that we are just provided with imprecise information about them (in terms of set-valued data sets). We cast some comparison criteria from the recent literature on learning methods from low-quality data as particular cases of our general approach.

To this end, a technological effort is required to develop neural network models which can be fed with the recorded electrophysiological patterns to yield the correct brain stimulation to recover the desired functions. In this paper we present a machine learning approach to derive the input-output function of the olfactory-limbic pathway in the in vitro whole brain of guinea pig, less complex and more controllable than an in vivo system. We first experimentally characterized the neuronal pathway by delivering different sets of electrical stimuli from the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) and by recording the corresponding responses in the lateral entorhinal cortex (l-ERC). As a second step, we used information theory to evaluate how much information output features carry about the input. Finally we used the acquired data to learn the LOT-l-ERC "I/O function," by means of the kernel regularized least squares method, able to predict l-ERC responses on the basis of LOT stimulation features. Our modeling approach can be further exploited for brain prostheses applications.

However, the use of these PTMs has done little to elucidate the complex behavior of nanoparticles in porous media and has failed to provide the mechanistic insights necessary to predictively model nanoparticle transport. The most prominent weakness of current PTMs stems from their inability to consider the influence of physicochemical conditions of the experiments on the transport of nanoparticles in porous media. Qualitative physicochemical influences on particle transport have been well studied and, in some cases, provide plausible explanations for some aspects of nanoparticle transport behavior. However, quantitative models that consider these influences have not yet been developed. With the current work, we intend to support the development of future mechanistic models by relating the physicochemical conditions of the experiments to the experimental outcome using ensemble machine learning (random forest) regression and classification. Regression results demonstrate that the fraction of nanoparticle mass retained over the column length (retained fraction, RF; a measure of nanoparticle transport) can be predicted with an expected mean squared error between 0.025-0.033. Additionally, we find that RF prediction was insensitive to nanomaterial type and that features such as concentration of natural organic matter,. potential of nanoparticles and collectors and the ionic strength and pH of the dispersion are strongly associated with the prediction of RF and should be targets for incorporation into mechanistic models. Classification results demonstrate that the shape of the retention profile (RP), such as hyperexponential or linearly decreasing, can be predicted with an expected F1-score between 60-70%. This relatively low performance in the prediction of the RP shape is most likely caused by the limited data on retention profile shapes that are currently available.

Hologram quantitative structure-activity relationship and comparative molecular interaction field analysis of aminothiazole and thiazolesulfonamide as reversible LSD1 inhibitors	FUTURE MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HISTONE DEMETHYLASE LSD1; MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; MULTITARGET QSAR MODELS; IN-SILICO DISCOVERY; CANCER AGENTS; DRUG DESIGN; LYSINE DEMETHYLASES; ANTICANCER THERAPY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; VALIDATION	Background: LSD-1 is an enzyme that removes methyl groups from lysine residues of histone proteins. LSD-1 inhibition decreases cellular proliferation and therefore represents a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. MAO and LSD-1 are both flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent MAOs, and the MAO inhibitor, tranylcypromine, is currently undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment because it acts as an irreversible LSD-1 inhibitor. Materials & methods: The present study investigated new reversible LSD-1 inhibitors, in order to develop novel selective anticancer agents. We constructed 2 and 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship models by using a series of 54 aminothiazole and thiazolesulfonamide derivatives. Results: The models were validated internally and externally (q(2), 0.691 and 0.701; r(2), 0.894 and 0.937; r(test)(2), 0.785 and 0.644, for 2 and 3D models, respectively). Fragment contribution maps, as well as steric and electrostatic contour maps were generated in order to obtain chemical information related to LSD-1 inhibition. Conclusion: The thiazolesulfonamide group was fundamental to the inhibition of LSD-1 by these compounds and that bulky and aromatic substituents at the thiazole ring were important for their steric and electrostatic interactions with the active site of LSD-1.

In particular, the presence of so-called funnels in multimodal problems offers the possibility of applying techniques exploiting the global structure of the function. The recently proposed Exploratory Landscape Analysis approach automatically identifies problem characteristics based on a moderately small initial sample of the objective function and proved to be effective for algorithm selection problems in continuous black-box optimization. In this paper, specific features for detecting funnel structures are introduced and combined with the existing ones in order to classify optimization problems regarding the funnel property. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by experiments on specifically generated test instances and validation experiments on standard benchmark problems.

Improved Sampling of Decision Space for Pareto Estimation	GECCO'15: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	17th Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 11-15, 2015	Madrid, SAN MARINO	Assoc Comp Machinery SIGEVO		Local search; Metaheuristics; Neural networks; Surrogate model/fitness approximation; Machine learning	MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; DESIGN	Pareto Estimation (PE) is a novel method for increasing the density of Pareto optimal solutions across the entire Pareto Front or in a specific region of interest. PE identifies the inverse mapping of Pareto optimal solutions, namely, from objective space to decision space. This identification can be performed using a number of modeling techniques, however, for the sake of simplicity in this work we use a radial basis neural network. In any modeling method, the quality of the resulting model depends heavily on the training samples used. The original version of PE uses the resulting set of Pareto optimal solutions from any multi-objective optimization algorithm and then utilizes this set to identify the aforementioned mapping. However, we argue that this selection may not always be the best possible and propose an alternative scheme to improve the resulting set of Pareto optimal solutions in order to produce higher quality samples for the identification scheme in PE. The proposed approach is integrated with MAEA-gD, and the resulting solutions are used with PE. The results show that the proposed method shows promise, in that there is measurable improvement in the quality of the estimated PE in terms of the coverage and density.

Often applied in both neuroevolution and morphological evolution, these new quality diversity (QD) algorithms are particularly well-suited to evolution's inherent strengths, thereby offering a promising niche for EC within the broader field of machine learning. However, because QD algorithms are so new, until now no comprehensive study has yet attempted to systematically elucidate their relative strengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Taking a first step in this direction, this paper introduces a new benchmark domain designed specifically to compare and contrast QD algorithms. It then shows how the degree of alignment between the measure of quality and the behavior characterization (which is an essential component of all QD algorithms to date) impacts the ultimate performance of different such algorithms. The hope is that this initial study will help to stimulate interest in QD and begin to unify the disparate ideas in the area.	[Pugh, Justin K.; Soros, L.

One problem seeing increased usage is the oral bioavailability problem, which is often presented as a challenging problem to both GP and other machine learning methods. However, few properties of the bioavailability data set have been demonstrated, so attributes that make it a challenging problem are largely unknown. This work uncovers important properties of the bioavailability data set, and suggests that the perceived difficulty in this problem can be partially attributed to a lack of pre-processing, including features within the data set that contain no information, and contradictory relationships between the dependent and independent features of the data set. The paper then re-examines the performance of GP on this data set, and contextualises this performance relative to other regression methods. Results suggest that a large component of the observed performance differences on the bioavailability data set can be attributed to variance in the selection of training and testing data. Differences in performance between GP and other methods disappear when multiple training/testing splits are used within experimental work, with performance typically no better than a null modelling approach of reporting the mean of the training data.

The GTMOEP (Georgia Tech Multiple Objective Evolutionary Programming) framework builds upon this by also handling feature vectors, allowing the use of signal processing and machine learning functions as primitives, in addition to the more conventional operators. GTMOEP is a novel method for automated, data-driven algorithm creation, capable of outperforming human derived solutions. As an example, GTMOEP was applied to the problem of predicting how long an emergency responder can remain in a hazmat suit before the effects of heat stress cause the user to become unsafe. An existing third-party physics model was leveraged for predicting core temperature from various situational parameters. However, a sustained high heart rate also means that a user is unsafe. To improve performance, GTMOEP was evaluated to predict an expected pull time, computed from both thresholds during human trials. GTMOEP produced dominant solutions in multiple objective space to the performance of predictions made by the physics model alone, resulting in a safer algorithm for emergency responders to determine operating times in harsh environments. The program generated by GTMOEP will be deployed to a mobile application for their use.

Knowledge Transfer from Keepaway Soccer to Half-field Offense through Program Symbiosis: Building Simple Programs for a Complex Task	GECCO'15: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	17th Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 11-15, 2015	Madrid, SAN MARINO	Assoc Comp Machinery SIGEVO		Coevolution; Multi-agent Systems; Task transfer; Games		Half-field Offense (HFO) is a sub-task of Robocup 2D Simulated Soccer. HFO is a challenging, multi-agent machine learning problem in which a team of offense players attempt to manoeuvre the ball past a defending team and around the goalie in order to score. The agent's sensors and actuators are noisy, making the problem highly stochastic and partially observable. These same real-world characteristics have made Keepaway soccer, which represents one sub-task of HFO, a popular testbed in the reinforcement learning and task-transfer literature in particular. We demonstrate how policies initially evolved for Keepaway can be reused within a symbiotic framework for coevolving policies in genetic programming (GP), with no additional training or transfer function, in order to improve learning in the HFO task. Moreover, the highly modular policies discovered by GP are shown to be significantly less complex than solutions based on traditional value-function optimization while achieving the same level of play in HFO.

The biomedical domain, in particular, is a sector that may greatly benefit from those techniques due to the huge and ever increasing amount of scientific publications describing observed phenomena of potential clinical interest. In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically identifying sentences that contain interactions between genes and proteins, based solely on a dictionary of genes and proteins and a small set of sample sentences in natural language. We propose an evolutionary technique for learning a classifier that is capable of detecting the desired sentences within scientific publications with high accuracy. The key feature of our proposal, that is internally based on Genetic Programming, is the construction of a model of the relevant syntax patterns in terms of standard part-of-speech annotations. The model consists of a set of regular expressions that are learned automatically despite the large alphabet size involved. We assess our approach on two realistic datasets and obtain 74% accuracy, a value sufficiently high to be of practical interest and that is in line with significant baseline methods.

This paper proposes SPRINT-Race, a multi-objective racing algorithm based on the Sequential Probability Ratio Test with an Indifference Zone. In SPRINT-Race, a non-parametric ternary-decision sequential analogue of the sign test is adopted to identify pair-wise dominance and non-dominance relationship. In addition, a Bonferroni approach is employed to control the overall probability of any erroneous decisions. In the fixed confidence setting, SPRINT-Race tries to minimize the computational effort needed to achieve a predefined confidence about the quality of the returned models. The efficiency of SPRTNT-Race is analyzed on artificially-constructed multi-objective model selection problems with known ground-truth. Moreover, SPRINT-Race is applied to identifying the Pareto optimal parameter settings of Ant Colony Optimization algorithms in the context of solving Traveling Salesman Problems. The experimental results confirm the advantages of SPRINT-Race for multi-objective model selection.

Although measuring the rate of bed load in situ is the most consistent method, it is very expensive and cannot be conducted for as many streams as the measurement of suspended sediment load. Therefore, in this study the role of suspended load on bedload prediction was examined by using sensitivity analysis. On the other hand, conventional sediment rating curves and equations can not predict sediment load accurately so recently the usage of machine learning algorithms increase rapidly. Accordingly, soft computational methods are used in the study. These are; artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) models and a decision tree (CHAID) model that is not used before in sediment studies. Some particular parameters are frequently used in these soft computational methods to form input sets. Hence, well known and commonly used three input sets and a new generated set are used as inputs to predict bedload and then the suspended load variable is added in these input sets. The performances of models with respect to input sets are compared to each other. To generate the results and to push the limits of models a very skewed and heterogeneous data is collected from distributed locations. The results indicate that the performance of ANN and CHAID tree models are good when compared to SVM models. The usage of a suspended load as an additional input for the models boosts the model performances and the suspended load has significant contributions to all models.

A dynamic programming technique adopted to find relevant genes from sequences which are longest and accurate is used for finding matching sequences and identifying effects of various factors. The proposed method could handle complex information sequences which give different meanings in different situations, eliminating irrelevant information. The text contents were pre-processed using a general-purpose method and were applied with entity tagging component. The bottom-up scanning of key-value pairs improves content finding to generate relevant sequences to the testing task. This paper highlights context-based extraction method for extracting food safety information, which is identified from articles, guideline documents and laboratory results. The graphical disease model verifies weak component through utilisation of development data set.

However, selecting an appropriate reference gene usually requires strict biological experiment for verification with high cost in the process of selection. Scientific literatures have accumulated a lot of achievements on the selection of reference gene. Therefore, mining reference genes under specific experiment environments from literatures can provide quite reliable reference genes for similar qRT-PCR experiments with the advantages of reliability, economic and efficiency. An auxiliary reference gene discovery method from literature is proposed in this paper which integrated machine learning, natural language processing and text mining approaches. The validity tests showed that this new method has a better precision and recall on the extraction of reference genes and their environments.

Deep learning is springing up in the field of machine learning recently. By mimicking the hierarchical structure of the human brain, deep learning can gradually extract features from lower level to higher level. The Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model is a widely investigated and deployed deep learning architecture. It combines the advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning and can archive good classification performance. This study proposes a classification approach based on the DBN model for detailed urban mapping using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. Through the DBN model, effective contextual mapping features can be automatically extracted from the PolSAR data to improve the classification performance. Two-date high-resolution RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data over the Great Toronto Area were used for evaluation. Comparisons with the support vector machine (SVM), conventional neural networks (NN), and stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) were conducted to assess the potential of the DBN-based classification approach. Experimental results show that the DBN-based method outperforms three other approaches and produces homogenous mapping results with preserved shape details.

Now a day,an Ensemble method of machine learning is widely used to implement intrusion detection system. By analyzing Ensemble method of machine learning and intrusion detection system in this paper, we make use of Bagging Ensemble method to implement Intrusion Detection system. The Partial Decision Tree is used as a base classifier due to its simplicity.The selections of relevant features are required to improve the accuracy of the classifier. The relevant features are selected based on their vitality for each type of attacks. The dimension of input feature space is reduced from 41 to 15 features using Genetic Algorithm. The proposed intrusion detection system is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, true positives, false positive and model building time. It was observed that proposed system achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.7166 % using cross validation. It exhibits higher classification accuracy than all classifiers except C4.5 classifier on test dataset.The Intrusion Detection system is simple and accurate due to simplicity of Partial Decision Tree.

Machine Learning Algorithm for Predicting Ethylene Responsive Transcription Factor in Rice Using an Ensemble Classifier	PROCEEDINGS OF 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL(ICAC3'15)	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Control (ICAC3)	APR 01-02, 2015	Mumbai, INDIA	Fr Conceicao Rodrigues Coll Engn		Random Forest; ERF; Machine learning	ARABIDOPSIS; DEHYDRATION; DOMAIN; FAMILY	Ethylene response factor (ERF) constitutes one of the most important gene families which are related to environmental responses and tolerancein plants. ERF genes are defined by the domain AP2/ERF, which comprises approximately 60 amino acids and are involved in DNA binding. Development of computational tools using machine learning tools will definitely enhance rice genome annotation. Machine learning algorithm involves construction and study of systems that can learn from data, rather than follow only explicitly programmed instructions. This study primarily emphasizes on the development of prediction tool, ERFPred, for drought responsive protein ERF in rice using machine learning algorithms. We have used fourteen different feature extraction methods including amino acid features, dipeptide, tripeptide, hybrid methods and exchange group features. Using, Random Forest classifier, we have obtained a precision rate of 100% for the ERFPred tool. To prove that species specific tool is better than an All plant tool, a general tool for plants, two different approaches were used and validated. The results obtained were also further compared with sequence similarity search tool, PSI-BLAST. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Threshold image segmentation algorithm according to the method of two dimension threshold has a lot of calculation in calculating the threshold, and the minimum error threshold method can not use the spatial information of image. This paper presents an intelligent image segmentation algorithm with Random Forest theory based on the night segmentation and feature extraction technology. The Random Forest algorithm shows unique advantages in dealing with small sample size, high-dimensional feature space, and complex data structures. An algorithm of vision image segmentation and feature extraction based on Random Forest is designed. Experimental results show that the segmentation process of this algorithm has less control parameters and faster convergence speed.

Crucial knowledge related activities that help organizations to enhance their knowledge base, exploit it efficiently and create values are knowledge integration (KI), knowledge Preservation (KP) and knowledge utilization (KU). Effective KI, KP and KU throughout the organization are essential for its productivity, innovation, and performance improvement. Lately, organizations are facing enormous challenges in efficient integration and sharing of knowledge created by employees while they use their mobile devices for work purposes. Mobile devices and smartphones have become an extension of employee's work environment and increasingly complementing office desktops, notebooks and stationary telephones. This transition is taking place primarily due to their ubiquitous availability, convenient size, reduced cost and simplicity in use. Moreover, technological advancement, better operational systems and ever-increasing quantity of apps ascertain that this trend will continue in the foreseeable future. Professionals use mobile devices actively and create valuable knowledge in the process. Lack of proper integration of these devices with the organization's knowledge management system creates a real problem of having access to this knowledge at a later stage. Important to note that due to real-time nature and its value in existing decision-making process, part of this knowledge is precious and requires particular attention in today's heightened competitive world. This paper proposes a semantic knowledge management system (KMS) framework architecture for transferring and integrating knowledge from mobile devices to organization's knowledge repositories. The proposed framework uses semantic technologies, distributed storage and processing of data, machine learning tools and artificial intelligence agents as foundational technological tools. The paper also posits that organizations should pay serious attention to the knowledge produced using mobile devices since a part of this knowledge is relevant to real-time operational, strategic, and market knowledge.

An empirical comparison of machine learning techniques for dam behaviour modelling	STRUCTURAL SAFETY			English	Article						Dam monitoring; Dam safety; Machine learning; Boosted regression trees; Neural networks; Random forests; MARS; Support vector machines; Leakage flow	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION	Predictive models are essential in dam safety assessment. Both deterministic and statistical models applied in the day-to-day practice have demonstrated to be useful, although they show relevant limitations at the same time. On another note, powerful learning algorithms have been developed in the field of machine learning (ML), which have been applied to solve practical problems. The work aims at testing the prediction capability of some state-of-the-art algorithms to model dam behaviour, in terms of displacements and leakage. Models based on random forests (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) are fitted to predict 14 target variables. Prediction accuracy is compared with the conventional statistical model, which shows poorer performance on average. BRT models stand out as the most accurate overall, followed, by NN and RF. It was also verified that the model fit can be improved by removing the records of the first years of dam functioning from the training set. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These ontologies are either built manually or populated automatically using machine learning techniques. A prerequisite condition to build such systems is the availability of ontology, which may be either full-fledged domain ontology or a seed ontology that can be enriched automatically. This is a dependency condition for any given semantics-based text classification system. We share the details of a proof of concept of a web classification system that is self-governed in terms of ontology population and does not require any prebuilt ontology, neither full-fledged nor seed. It starts from a user query, builds a seed ontology from it, and automatically enriches it by extracting concepts from the downloaded documents only. The evaluated parameters like precision (85%), accuracy (86%), AUC (convex), and MCC (high positive) demonstrate the better performance of the proposed system when compared with similar automated text classification systems.

Such communication can be indicative to popular public opinions and may be influential to real-life events. It is worth to identify topic groups from it automatically so it can help the analyst to understand the social network easily. However, due to the short-length of the texts used, the precise meaning and context of such texts are often ambiguous. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid framework, which adapts and extends the text clustering technique that uses Wikipedia as background knowledge. Based on this method, we are able to achieve higher level of precision in identifying the group of messages that has the similar topic.

They play an important role in regulating gene transcription and the regulation of normal development. MicroRNAs can be associated with disease; however, only a few microRNA-disease associations have been confirmed by traditional experimental approaches. We introduce two methods to predict microRNA-disease association. The first method, KATZ, focuses on integrating the social network analysis method with machine learning and is based on networks derived from known microRNA-disease associations, disease-disease associations, and microRNA-microRNA associations. The other method, CATAPULT, is a supervised machine learning method.

J	Balaban, S		Kakadiaris, IA; Kumar, A; Scheirer, WJ		Balaban, Stephen			Deep learning and face recognition: the state of the art	BIOMETRIC AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY FOR HUMAN AND ACTIVITY IDENTIFICATION XII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Biometric and Surveillance Technology for Human and Activity Identification XII	APR 22, 2015	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Deep Learning; Feature Learning; Representation Learning; Facial Recognition; Face verification; Face identification; biometrics	NETWORK	Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have established themselves as a dominant technique in machine learning. DNNs have been top performers on a wide variety of tasks including image classification, speech recognition, and face recognition.(1-3) Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in nearly all of the top performing methods on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.(3-6) In this talk and accompanying paper, I attempt to provide a review and summary of the deep learning techniques used in the state-of-the-art. In addition, I highlight the need for both larger and more challenging public datasets to benchmark these systems. Despite the ability of DNNs and autoencoders to perform unsupervised feature learning, modern facial recognition pipelines still require domain specific engineering in the form of re-alignment. For example, in Facebook's recent Deep Face paper, a 3D "frontalization" step lies at the beginning of the pipeline. This step creates a 3D face model for the incoming image and then uses a series of affine transformations of the fiducial points to "frontalize" the image. This step enables the Deep Face system to use a neural network architecture with locally connected layers without weight sharing as opposed to standard convolutional layers.(6) Deep learning techniques combined with large datasets have allowed research groups to surpass human level performance on the LFW dataset.(3,5) The high accuracy (99.63% for Face Net at the time of publishing) and utilization of outside data (hundreds of millions of images in the case of Google's Face Net) suggest that current face verification benchmarks such as LFW may not be challenging enough, nor provide enough data, for current techniques.(3,5) There exist a variety of organizations with mobile photo sharing applications that would be capable of releasing a very large scale and highly diverse dataset of facial images captured on mobile devices. Such an "Image Net for Face Recognition" would likely receive a warm welcome from researchers and practitioners alike.

The main aim of this study is to compare the performance of algorithms those are used to predict diabetes using data mining techniques. In this paper we compare machine learning classifiers (J48 Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to classify patients with diabetes mellitus. These approaches have been tested with data samples downloaded from UCI machine learning data repository. The performances of the algorithms have been measured in both the cases i.e dataset with noisy data (before pre-processing) and dataset set without noisy data (after pre-processing) and compared in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity.

In structural health monitoring (SHM) applications, haptic devices have been introduced and applied in a simplified laboratory scale scenario, in which nonlinearity, representing the presence of damage, was encoded into a vibratory manual interface. In this paper, the "spirit" of haptics is adopted, but here ultrasonic guided wave scattering information is transformed into audio (rather than tactile) range signals. After sufficient training, the structural damage condition, including occurrence and location, can be identified through the encoded audio waveforms. Different algorithms are employed in this paper to generate the transformed audio signals and the performance of each encoding algorithms is compared, and also compared with standard machine learning classifiers. In the long run, the haptic decision-making is aiming to detect and classify structural damages in a more rigorous environment, and approaching a baseline-free fashion with embedded temperature compensation.

Most analysis tools, however, start from the premises that models are fully specified, so that any parameters controlling the system's dynamics must be known exactly. As this is seldom the case, many methods have been devised over the last decade to infer (learn) such parameters from observations of the state of the system. In this paper, we depart from this approach by assuming that our observations are qualitative properties encoded as satisfaction of linear temporal logic formulae, as opposed to quantitative observations of the state of the system. An important feature of this approach is that it unifies naturally the system identification and the system design problems, where the properties, instead of observations, represent requirements to be satisfied. We develop a principled statistical estimation procedure based on maximising the likelihood of the system's parameters, using recent ideas from statistical machine learning. We demonstrate the efficacy and broad applicability of our method on a range of simple but non-trivial examples, including rumour spreading in social networks and hybrid models of gene regulation.

An RSI is any surgical tool, sponge, needle or other item inadvertently left in a patients body during the course of surgery. If left undetected, RSIs may lead to serious negative health consequences such as sepsis, internal bleeding, and even death. To help physicians efficiently and effectively detect RSIs, we are developing computer-aided detection (CADe) software for X-ray (XR) image analysis, utilizing large amounts of currently available image data to produce a clinically effective RSI detection system. Physician analysis of XRs for the purpose of RSI detection is a relatively lengthy process that may take up to 45 minutes to complete. It is also error prone due to the relatively low acuity of the human eye for RSIs in XR images. The system we are developing is based on computer vision and machine learning algorithms. We address the problem of low incidence by proposing synthesis algorithms. The CADe software we are developing may be integrated into a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), be implemented as a stand-alone software application, or be integrated into portable XR machine software through application programming interfaces. Preliminary experimental results on actual XR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 95% of TB deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries that often have under-resourced health care systems. In an effort to aid population screening in such resource challenged settings, the U.S. National Library of Medicine has developed a chest X-ray (CXR) screening system that provides a pre-decision on pulmonary abnormalities. When the system is presented with a digital CXR image from the Picture Archive and Communication Systems (PACS) or an imaging source, it automatically identifies the lung regions in the image, extracts image features, and classifies the image as normal or abnormal using trained machine-learning algorithms. The system has been trained on adult CXR images, and this article presents enhancements toward including pediatric CXR images. Our adult lung boundary detection algorithm is model-based. We note the lung shape differences during pediatric developmental stages, and adulthood, and propose building new lung models suitable for pediatric developmental stages. In this study, we quantify changes in lung shape from infancy to adulthood toward enhancing our lung segmentation algorithm. Our initial findings suggest pediatric age groupings of 0 - 23 months, 2 - 10 years, and 11 - 18 years. We present justification for our groupings. We report on the quality of boundary detection algorithm with the pediatric lung models.

Therefore, measurement and calculation of its accurate value is worthwhile. While the experimental methods for measurement of viscosity are expensive and time consuming, some credible correlations were developed to predict the viscosity with enough accuracy. For this purpose, in this study a balky data bank was gathered from open literature sources, and then one machine learning based approach called least square support vector machine (LSSVM) was utilized for prediction of heavy and extra-heavy crude oil viscosity. The parameters of proposed model were optimized by couple simulated annealing (CSA) optimization approach. The inputs of this model are temperature and kerosene mass fraction and the only output is viscosity.

Kernel partial least squares (KPLS) algorithm can construct nonlinear model using extract latent variables from the input and output data space simultaneously. However, generalization performance of KPLS model relies mostly on kernel types and kernel parameters, which are difference to modeling of different applicable background. Intelligent optimization algorithm can be used to search these parameters. Thus, a new multi-kernel partial least squares regression approach based on linear multi-kernel construction method and adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is proposed in this paper. Normally used global and local kernels are weighed to obtain the mixed multi-kernel of KPLS algorithm. These kernel's parameters and weighting coefficients are selected using AGA optimization algorithm. The experimental results based on Benchmark data set show that the proposed approach has better prediction performance than that of single kernel based modeling method.

This study focuses on the comparison between pixel-based classification and object-based classification of five machine learning algorithms including Parallelepiped (PP), Minimum Distance (MD), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Mahalanobis Distance (MH) and Neural Network (NN) using radar satellite image in extracting that flood extent. TerraSAR-X image was used to map the flood extent of the study area. In object-based approach, there were three simple machine learning algorithms such as PP, MD, MH together with NN performed with high accuracy while in pixel based approach, NN was the highest accuracy of all machine learning algorithms. The best output was chosen to be converted to vector format for mapping the flood extent. The result showed clearly through the map output that Kubang Pasu, Kota Setar and Kangar districts were highly affected by the flood. From the flood extent information, the collaboration of government, private sector, Non Governmental Organization (NGO) and community are needed to play the appropriate role in managing flood damage especially at the highly affected area and thus prevent loss of human live. Besides that, the authority could take action plan for pre-disaster, during and post-disaster caused by flooding.

Hence, these occurring changes have led to draw the conclusion that the number of attacks on the important information over the internet is increasing yearly. Intrusion is one of the main threat to the internet. Various techniques and approaches have been developed to address the limitations of intrusion detection system such as low accuracy, high false alarm rate, and time consuming. This research proposed a hybrid machine learning technique for network intrusion detection based on combination of K-means clustering and support vector machine classification. The aim of this research is to reduce the rate of false positive alarm, false negative alarm rate and to improve the detection rate. The NSL-KDD dataset has been used in the proposed technique. In order to improve classification performance, some steps have been taken on the dataset. The classification has been performed by using support vector machine. After training and testing the proposed hybrid machine learning technique, the results have shown that the proposed technique has achieved a positive detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate.

This paper discusses an evaluation study on different single decision tree classifiers. There are various single decision tree classifiers which have been extensively applied in medical decision making; each of these classifies the data with different accuracy rate. Since accuracy is crucial in medical decision making, it is important to identify a classifier with the best accuracy. The study examines the performance of fourteen single decision tree classifiers on three medical data sets, i.e. Wisconsin's breast cancer data sets, Pima Indian diabetes data sets and hepatitis data sets. All classifiers were trained and tested using WEKA and cross validation. The results revealed that classifiers such as FT, LMT, NB tree, Random Forest and Random Tree are the five best single classifiers as they constantly provide better accuracy in their classifications.

Those developments have been impacting all fields of science, at every step of the scientific method: data collection, data analysis, inference, science communication and outreach. The rate at which data is being generated is increasing exponentially, giving opportunities to improve our understanding of soils. Parallel developments in computing hardware and methods, such as machine learning, open ways to not only harness the "data deluge", but also offer a new way to generate knowledge. Finally, emerging data and information delivery protocols are leveraging the outreach power of the World Wide Web to disseminate scientific data and information, and increase their use and understanding outside the boundaries of a given scientific field. However, the nature of this data is mostly new to soil science, and requires adaptation to its diversity and volume. In particular, the integration of the significant amount of legacy soil data collected throughout decades of soil science can be problematic when all necessary metadata is not available. Likewise, knowledge accumulated by our scientific field needs to be acknowledged by - rather than opposed to - numerical methods. While the introduction of this set of emerging technologies is enabling soil science from different points of view, its successful implementation depends on the ability of soil scientists to act as knowledge brokers and support numerical methods.

These volunteers contribute in various ways: making and analyzing new observations, visually classifying features in images and light curves, exploring models constrained by astronomical data sets, and initiating new scientific enquiries. The most productive citizen astronomy projects involve close collaboration between the professionals and amateurs involved and occupy scientific niches not easily filled by great observatories or machine learning methods: Citizen astronomers are motivated by being of service to science, as well as by their interest in the subject. We expect participation and productivity in citizen astronomy to increase, as data sets get larger and citizen science platforms become more efficient.

J	Muzaffar, AW; Azam, F; Qamar, U				Muzaffar, Abdul Wahab; Azam, Farooque; Qamar, Usman			A Relation Extraction Framework for Biomedical Text Using Hybrid Feature Set	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; INFORMATION; PROGRESS; NETWORK	The information extraction from unstructured text segments is a complex task. Although manual information extraction often produces the best results, it is harder to manage biomedical data extraction manually because of the exponential increase in data size. Thus, there is a need for automatic tools and techniques for information extraction in biomedical text mining. Relation extraction is a significant area under biomedical information extraction that has gained much importance in the last two decades. A lot of work has been done on biomedical relation extraction focusing on rule-based and machine learning techniques. In the last decade, the focus has changed to hybrid approaches showing better results. This research presents a hybrid feature set for classification of relations between biomedical entities. The main contribution of this research is done in the semantic feature set where verb phrases are ranked using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and a ranking algorithm. Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes, the two effective machine learning techniques, are used to classify these relations. Our approach has been validated on the standard biomedical text corpus obtained from MEDLINE 2001. Conclusively, it can be articulated that our framework outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches used for relation extraction on the same corpus.

A minimum of $4.8 million is lost due to landslide related damages every year in Illawara region of Australia. At present, Data mining and knowledge discovery techniques are becoming popular in building landslide susceptibility models due to their enhanced predictive performances. Until now, the lack of tools to undertake data extraction and making the predictions have limited the applicability of this novel technique in landslide model building. This paper discusses the development of the LSDM (Landslide Susceptibility Data Mining) toolbar which was designed to utilize machine learning techniques within a GIS environment by coupling GIS and data mining software (See5) capabilities. The software development kit available with ArcGIS v. 10 has been utilized in developing the toolbar add-in. The fundamental tasks; data preparation, model optimizing, derivation of decision trees, predictions and validation are all performed using the individual controls available in the toolbar. This tool automates the entire model building process and in preparation of training data and producing outcomes that are compliant with both national and international Landslide Risk management guidelines.

The inhibition of Pgp has become a notable strategy for combating multidrug-resistant cancers and improving therapeutic outcomes. However, the polyspecific nature of Pgp, together with inconsistent results in experimental assays, renders the determination of endpoints for Pgp-interacting compounds a great challenge. In this study, the classification of a large set of 2,477 Pgp-interacting compounds (i.e., 1341 inhibitors, 913 non-inhibitors, 197 substrates and 26 non-substrates) was performed using several machine learning methods (i.e., decision tree induction, artificial neural network modelling and support vector machine) as a function of their physicochemical properties. The models provided good predictive performance, producing MCC values in the range of 0.739-1 for internal cross-validation and 0.665-1 for external validation. The study provided simple and interpretable models for important properties that influence the activity of Pgp-interacting compounds, which are potentially beneficial for screening and rational design of Pgp inhibitors that are of clinical importance.

We applied the method to expansion rates of the lateral ventricles, achieving the most powerful ventricular atrophy measure to date. Here, we expand our method's application to tensor-based morphometry measures. We also combine the volumetric tensor-based morphometry measures with previously computed ventricular surface measures into a combined atrophy score. We show that our atrophy scores are longitudinally unbiased with the intercept bias estimated at 2 orders of magnitude below the mean atrophy of control subjects at 1 year. Both approaches yield the most powerful biomarker of atrophy not only for ventricular measures but also for all published unbiased imaging measures to date. A 2-year trial using our measures requires only 31 (22, 43) Alzheimer's disease subjects or 56 (44, 64) subjects with mild cognitive impairment to detect 25% slowing in atrophy with 80% power and 95% confidence.

Genome-wide search of all possible SNP-SNP interactions is challenging and rarely attempted because of the complexity of conducting approximately 10(11) pairwise statistical tests. However, recent advances in machine learning, for example, iterative sure independence screening, make it possible to analyze data sets with vastly more predictors than observations. Using an implementation of the sure independence screening algorithm (called EPISIS), we performed a genome-wide interaction analysis testing all possible SNP-SNP interactions affecting regional brain volumes measured on magnetic resonance imaging and mapped using tensor-based morphometry. We identified a significant SNP-SNP interaction between rs1345203 and rs1213205 that explains 1.9% of the variance in temporal lobe volume. We mapped the whole brain, voxelwise effects of the interaction in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set and separately in an independent replication data set of healthy twins (Queensland Twin Imaging). Each additional loading in the interaction effect was associated with approximately 5% greater brain regional brain volume (a protective effect) in both Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Queensland Twin Imaging samples.

There are problems will have a negative impact on enterprises participants end up. The efficiency of e-commerce is an important way for a proper evaluation of improving management. In this paper, we propose the theory of knowledge mining based on Rough Set Theory to handle the vague and inaccurate information about the evaluation of supplier and mine the law knowledge that exists between input variables and adverse position. The RST output is then used as the feature and sent to the Logistic regression (LR) to the electronic commerce website product grade.

These characteristics support the development of statistical algorithms at a high level of abstraction. Although R is commonly used in the statistics domain a big disadvantage are its runtime problems when handling computation-intensive algorithms. Especially in the domain of machine learning the execution of pure R programs is often unacceptably slow. Our long-term goal is to resolve these issues and in this contribution we used the traceR tool to analyse the bottlenecks arising in this domain. Here we measured the runtime and overall memory consumption on a well-defined set of classical machine learning applications and gained detailed insights into the performance issues of these programs.

Automatic model selection for high-dimensional survival analysis	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						model selection; feature selection; algorithm configuration; survival analysis; machine learning; high-dimensional data; racing; parameter tuning	GENE-EXPRESSION; REGRESSION; REGULARIZATION; VALIDATION; PREDICTION	Many different models for the analysis of high-dimensional survival data have been developed over the past years. While some of the models and implementations come with an internal parameter tuning automatism, others require the user to accurately adjust defaults, which often feels like a guessing game. Exhaustively trying out all model and parameter combinations will quickly become tedious or infeasible in computationally intensive settings, even if parallelization is employed. Therefore, we propose to use modern algorithm configuration techniques, e.g. iterated F-racing, to efficiently move through the model hypothesis space and to simultaneously configure algorithm classes and their respective hyperparameters. In our application we study four lung cancer microarray data sets. For these we configure a predictor based on five survival analysis algorithms in combination with eight feature selection filters. We parallelize the optimization and all comparison experiments with the BatchJobs and BatchExperiments R packages.

From Genre Classification to Rhythm Similarity: Computational and Musicological Insights	JOURNAL OF NEW MUSIC RESEARCH			English	Article						machine learning; information retrieval; audio analysis; music analysis	SCALE TRANSFORM; MUSIC; RECOGNITION	Traditionally, the development and validation of computational measures of rhythmic similarity in music relies on proxy classification tasks, often equating rhythm similarity to genre. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary exploration of the classification performance of a state-of-the-art system for rhythm similarity. By synthesizing the methods of quantitative analysis with a musicological perspective, detailed insight is gained into the various facets that affect system behaviour, consisting of three main areas: rhythmic sensitivities of a given feature representation, idiosyncrasies of the data used for evaluation, and the tenuous relationship between rhythmic similarity and genre. Through this study, we provide perspective on gauging the abilities of a computational system beyond classification accuracy, as well as a deeper understanding of system design and evaluation methodology as a musically meaningful exercise.

Modulation Spectral Features: In Pursuit of Invariant Representations of Music with Application to Unsupervised Source Identification	JOURNAL OF NEW MUSIC RESEARCH			English	Article						music analysis; audio analysis; machine learning; information retrieval	AMPLITUDE-MODULATION; FREQUENCY FEATURES; SPEECH; RECOGNITION; SIGNALS; DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROGRAM; EXTRACTION; COMPONENTS	Modulation frequency analysis has been studied predominantly in research areas such as communications, filtering and coding of digital signals, and representations of neurons in the biomedical field. In turn, modulation frequency features have surfaced in the area of music data mining, also known as music information retrieval (MIR). The term 'modulation spectral features' has been used rather loosely, but we refer to them as temporal patterns in a signal that may be revealed via the modulation spectrum. This paper consists of a literature survey of modulation features in which we review the historical use of general modulation features along with evolving interest in exploring modulation spectral features for data mining in music signals. We also discuss challenges encountered in employing modulation spectral features with music signals and suggest new directions in this area. Lastly, we further exploit modulation spectral features by applying these motivated concepts, properties, and parameters of modulation spectra and its features to our preliminary, unsupervised source identification method for sound sources of periodic, temporal patterns.

An observation can consist of multiple attributes, multiple data types, and different orders of preference. Due to diverse practical applications, the ranking problem has been receiving attention in the domain of machine learning and statistics, some of those applications being webpage ranking, gene ranking, pesticide risk assessment, credit-risk screening, etc. In this article, we will present and discuss a novel and fast clustering-based algorithmic ranking technique and provide necessary theoretical working. The proposed technique utilizes the interrelationships among the observations to perform ranking and is based on the crossing minimization paradigm from the domain of VLSI chip design. Using laboratory ranking results as a reference, we compare the algorithmic ranking of the proposed technique and two traditional ranking techniques: the Hasse Diagram Technique (HDT) and the Hierarchical Clustering (HC) technique. The results demonstrate that our technique generates better rankings compared to the traditional ranking techniques and closely matches the laboratory results that took days of work.

A more modern view is to envision drivers and passengers as actively interacting with a complex automated system. Such interactive activity leads us to consider intelligent and advanced ways of interaction leading to cars that can adapt to their drivers. In this article, we focus on the adaptive cruise control (ACC) technology that allows a vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to maintain a preset distance from the vehicle in front of it based on the driver's preferences. Although individual drivers have different driving styles and preferences, current systems do not distinguish among users. We introduce an approach to combine machine learning algorithms with demographic information and behavioral driver models into existing automated assistive systems. This approach can reduce the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This approach sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users. While generic packages such as Weka were successful in learning drivers' behavior exclusively based on the ACC's sensors, we found that improved learning models could be developed by adding information on drivers' demographics and a previously developed model about different driver types. We present the general methodology of our learning procedure and suggest applications of our approach to other domains as well.

In recent years, many machine learning techniques [e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been successfully applied to CCPR. However, such existing research for CCPR has mostly been developed for identification of basic CCPs. Little attention has been given to the utilization of ANNs/SVMs for identification of concurrent CCPs (two or more basic CCPs occurring simultaneously) which are commonly encountered in practical manufacturing processes. In addition, these existing research for CCPR cannot provide more detailed CCP parameter information, such as shift magnitude, trend slope, cycle amplitude, etc., which is very useful for quality practitioners to search the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. This study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) with extreme learning machine (ELM) to identify typical concurrent CCPs and in addition to accurately quantify the major CCP parameter of the specific basic CCPs involved. The numerical results indicate that the proposed model can effectively identify not only concurrent CCPs but also basic CCPs. Meanwhile, the major CCP parameter of the identified concurrent CCP can also be accurately quantified. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Single-channel separation using underdetermined blind autoregressive model and least absolute deviation	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Autoregressive process; Underdetermined system; Blind source separation; Machine learning; Sparse; Time-frequency	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; SIGNALS	A novel "artificial stereo" mixture is proposed to resemble a synthetic stereo signal for solving the signal-channel blind source separation (SCBSS) problem. The proposed SCBSS framework takes the advantages of the following desirable properties; one microphone; no training phase; no parameter turning; independent of initialization and a priori data of the sources. The artificial stereo mixture is formulated by weighting and time-shifting the single-channel observed mixture. Separability analysis of the proposed mixture model has also been elicited to examine that the artificial stereo mixture is separable. For the separation process, mixing coefficients of sources are estimated where the source signals are modeled by the autoregressive process. Subsequently, a binary time-frequency mask can then be constructed by evaluating the least absolute deviation cost function. Finally, experimental testing on autoregressive sources has shown that the proposed framework yields superior separation performance and is computationally very fast compared with existing SCBSS methods.

Here we introduce The Decoding Toolbox (TDT) which represents a user-friendly, powerful and flexible package for multivariate analysis of functional brain imaging data. TDT is written in Matlab and equipped with an interface to the widely used brain data analysis package SPM. The toolbox allows running fast whole-brain analyses, region-of-interest analyses and searchlight analyses, using machine learning classifiers, pattern correlation analysis, or representational similarity analysis. It offers automatic creation and visualization of diverse cross-validation schemes, feature scaling, nested parameter selection, a variety of feature selection methods, multiclass capabilities, and pattern reconstruction from classifier weights. While basic users can implement a generic analysis in one line of code, advanced users can extend the toolbox to their needs or exploit the structure to combine it with external high-performance classification toolboxes. The toolbox comes with an example data set which can be used to try out the various analysis methods. Taken together, TDT offers a promising option for researchers who want to employ multivariate analyses of brain activity patterns.

High resolution X-ray crystallographic structures are available for TS and, owing to its relatively small size, successful experimental mutagenesis studies have been conducted on the enzyme. In this study, an in silico mutagenesis technique is used to investigate the effects of single amino acid substitutions in TS on enzymatic activity, one that employs the TS protein structure as well as a knowledge-based, four-body statistical potential. For every single residue TS variant, this approach yields both a global structural perturbation score and a set of local environmental perturbation scores that characterize the mutated position as well as all structurally neighboring residues. Global scores for the TS variants are capable of uniquely characterizing groups of residue positions in the enzyme according to their physicochemical, functional, or structural properties. Additionally, these global scores elucidate a statistically significant structure-function relationship among a collection of 372 single residue TS variants whose activity levels have been experimentally determined. Predictive models of TS variant activity are subsequently trained on this dataset of experimental mutants, whose respective feature vectors encode information regarding the mutated position as well as its six nearest residue neighbors in the TS structure, including their environmental perturbation scores.

The human splicing code reveals new insights into the genetic determinants of disease	SCIENCE			English	Article							AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; COPY NUMBER VARIATION; MESSENGER-RNA; MISSENSE MUTATIONS; FUNCTIONAL IMPACT; MISMATCH REPAIR; EXONIC VARIANTS; HUMAN CANCERS; PREDICTION; GENOME	To facilitate precision medicine and whole-genome annotation, we developed a machine-learning technique that scores how strongly genetic variants affect RNA splicing, whose alteration contributes to many diseases. Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries in precision medicine.

The effects of chemical substances on embryo survival and development are generally evaluated manually through microscopic observation by an expert and documented by several typical photographs. Here, we present a methodology to automatically classify brightfield images of wildtype zebrafish embryos according to their defects by using an image analysis approach based on supervised machine learning. We show that, compared to manual classification, automatic classification results in 90 to 100% agreement with consensus voting of biological experts in nine out of eleven considered defects in 3 days old zebrafish larvae. Automation of the analysis and classification of zebrafish embryo pictures reduces the workload and time required for the biological expert and increases the reproducibility and objectivity of this classification.

Nevertheless, real datasets are quite far from being monotone and this can sharply limit the performance of purely monotone classifiers while standard classifiers are simply insensitive to monotonicity. Here we focus on rank discrimination measures to be used in decision tree induction, i.e., functions able to measure the discrimination power of an attribute with respect to the class taking into account the monotonicity of the class with respect to the attribute. Three new measures are studied in detail and a hierarchical construction model is derived allowing the formal definition of a general rank discrimination measure. Our measures have been compared with other well-known proposals, quantifying both the accuracy and the monotonicity of the resulting binary decision tree classifiers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

SOLAR FLARE PREDICTION USING SDO/HMI VECTOR MAGNETIC FIELD DATA WITH A MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHM	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Sun: activity; Sun: flares	QUIET ACTIVE REGIONS; FORECASTING METHODS; MAGNETOGRAMS; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; SHEAR	We attempt to forecast M- and X-class solar flares using a machine-learning algorithm, called support vector machine (SVM), and four years of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, the first instrument to continuously map the full-disk photospheric vector magnetic field from space. Most flare forecasting efforts described in the literature use either line-of-sight magnetograms or a relatively small number of ground-based vector magnetograms. This is the first time a large data set of vector magnetograms has been used to forecast solar flares. We build a catalog of flaring and non-flaring active regions sampled from a database of 2071 active regions, comprised of 1.5 million active region patches of vector magnetic field data, and characterize each active region by 25 parameters. We then train and test the machine-learning algorithm and we estimate its performances using forecast verification metrics with an emphasis on the true skill statistic (TSS). We obtain relatively high TSS scores and overall predictive abilities. We surmise that this is partly due to fine-tuning the SVM for this purpose and also to an advantageous set of features that can only be calculated from vector magnetic field data. We also apply a feature selection algorithm to determine which of our 25 features are useful for discriminating between flaring and non-flaring active regions and conclude that only a handful are needed for good predictive abilities.

A MACHINE-LEARNING METHOD TO INFER FUNDAMENTAL STELLAR PARAMETERS FROM PHOTOMETRIC LIGHT CURVES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; stars: general; stars: statistics; stars: variables: general; surveys	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; AUTOMATED SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; VARIABLE-STARS; RANDOM FORESTS; DATA RELEASE; SPACED DATA; CATALOG; METALLICITY; VARIABILITY	A fundamental challenge for wide-field imaging surveys is obtaining follow-up spectroscopic observations: there are >10(9) photometrically cataloged sources, yet modern spectroscopic surveys are limited to similar to fewx10(6) targets. As we approach the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era, new algorithmic solutions are required to cope with the data deluge. Here we report the development of a machine-learning framework capable of inferring fundamental stellar parameters (T-eff, log g, and [Fe/H]) using photometric-brightness variations and color alone. A training set is constructed from a systematic spectroscopic survey of variables with Hectospec/ Multi-Mirror Telescope. In sum, the training set includes similar to 9000 spectra, for which stellar parameters are measured using the SEGUE Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). We employed the random forest algorithm to perform a non-parametric regression that predicts Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] from photometric time-domain observations. Our final optimized model produces a cross-validated rms error (RMSE) of 165 K, 0.39 dex, and 0.33 dex for T-eff, log g, and [Fe/H], respectively. Examining the subset of sources for which the SSPP measurements are most reliable, the RMSE reduces to 125 K, 0.37 dex, and 0.27 dex, respectively, comparable to what is achievable via low-resolution spectroscopy. For variable stars this represents a approximate to 12%-20% improvement in RMSE relative to models trained with single-epoch photometric colors. As an application of our method, we estimate stellar parameters for similar to 54,000 known variables. We argue that this method may convert photometric time-domain surveys into pseudo-spectrographic engines, enabling the construction of extremely detailed maps of the Milky Way, its structure, and history.

Ensemble learning of inverse probability weights for marginal structural modeling in large observational datasets	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						ensemble learning; super learning; marginal structural model; inverse probability weighting; data-adaptive; longitudinal data	STACKED GENERALIZATION; SURVIVAL	Inverse probability weights used to fit marginal structural models are typically estimated using logistic regression. However, a data-adaptive procedure may be able to better exploit information available in measured covariates. By combining predictions from multiple algorithms, ensemble learning offers an alternative to logistic regression modeling to further reduce bias in estimated marginal structural model parameters. We describe the application of two ensemble learning approaches to estimating stabilized weights: super learning (SL), an ensemble machine learning approach that relies on V-fold cross validation, and an ensemble learner (EL) that creates a single partition of the data into training and validation sets. Longitudinal data from two multicenter cohort studies in Spain (CoRIS and CoRIS-MD) were analyzed to estimate the mortality hazard ratio for initiation versus no initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy among HIV positive subjects. Both ensemble approaches produced hazard ratio estimates further away from the null, and with tighter confidence intervals, than logistic regression modeling. Computation time for EL was less than half that of SL. We conclude that ensemble learning using a library of diverse candidate algorithms offers an alternative to parametric modeling of inverse probability weights when fitting marginal structural models. With large datasets, EL provides a rich search over the solution space in less time than SL with comparable results. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Consensus Genotyper for Exome Sequencing (CGES): improving the quality of exome variant genotypes	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENOME ANALYSIS; SNP; DISCOVERY; FRAMEWORK; FORMAT; GALAXY	Motivation: The development of cost-effective next-generation sequencing methods has spurred the development of high-throughput bioinformatics tools for detection of sequence variation. With many disparate variant-calling algorithms available, investigators must ask, 'Which method is best for my data?' Machine learning research has shown that so-called ensemble methods that combine the output of multiple models can dramatically improve classifier performance. Here we describe a novel variant-calling approach based on an ensemble of variant-calling algorithms, which we term the Consensus Genotyper for Exome Sequencing (CGES). CGES uses a two-stage voting scheme among four algorithm implementations. While our ensemble method can accept variants generated by any variant-calling algorithm, we used GATK2.8, SAMtools, FreeBayes and Atlas-SNP2 in building CGES because of their performance, widespread adoption and diverse but complementary algorithms. Results: We apply CGES to 132 samples sequenced at the Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology (HAIB, Huntsville, AL) using the Nimblegen Exome Capture and Illumina sequencing technology. Our sample set consisted of 40 complete trios, two families of four, one parent-child duo and two unrelated individuals. CGES yielded the fewest total variant calls (N-CGES= 139 degrees 897), the highest Ts/Tv ratio (3.02), the lowest Mendelian error rate across all genotypes (0.028%), the highest rediscovery rate from the Exome Variant Server (EVS; 89.3%) and 1000 Genomes (1KG; 84.1%) and the highest positive predictive value (PPV; 96.1%) for a random sample of previously validated de novo variants. We describe these and other quality control (QC) metrics from consensus data and explain how the CGES pipeline can be used to generate call sets of varying quality stringency, including consensus calls present across all four algorithms, calls that are consistent across any three out of four algorithms, calls that are consistent across any two out of four algorithms or a more liberal set of all calls made by any algorithm.

Rcpi: R/Bioconductor package to generate various descriptors of proteins, compounds and their interactions	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PREDICTION; BIOINFORMATICS; FEATURES; BIOLOGY; PSEAAC	In chemoinformatics and bioinformatics fields, one of the main computational challenges in various predictive modeling is to find a suitable way to effectively represent the molecules under investigation, such as small molecules, proteins and even complex interactions. To solve this problem, we developed a freely available R/Bioconductor package, called Compound-Protein Interaction with R (Rcpi), for complex molecular representation from drugs, proteins and more complex interactions, including protein-protein and compound-protein interactions. Rcpi could calculate a large number of structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequences, molecular descriptors of small molecules from their topology and protein-protein interaction and compound-protein interaction descriptors. In addition to main functionalities, Rcpi could also provide a number of useful auxiliary utilities to facilitate the user's need. With the descriptors calculated by this package, the users could conveniently apply various statistical machine learning methods in R to solve various biological and drug research questions in computational biology and drug discovery.

J	Hirose, S; Nambu, I; Naito, E				Hirose, Satoshi; Nambu, Isao; Naito, Eiichi			An empirical solution for over-pruning with a novel ensemble-learning method for fMRI decoding	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Multi-voxel pattern classification; Ensemble-learning; Over-pruning; Sparse logistic regression; Iterative Recycling (iRec); iSLR	CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; SELECTION; CLASSIFIERS; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; EXPERTS; CORTEX; STATES; MOTOR	Background: Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) decoding techniques allow us to predict the contents of sensory and motor events or participants' mental states from multi-voxel patterns of fMRI signals. Sparse logistic regression (SLR) is a useful pattern classification algorithm that has the advantage of being able to automatically select voxels to avoid over-fitting. However, SLR suffers from over-pruning, in which many voxels that are potentially useful for prediction are discarded. New method: We propose an ensemble solution for over-pruning, called "Iterative Recycling" (iRec), in which sparse classifiers are trained iteratively by recycling over-pruned voxels. Results: Our simulation demonstrates that iRec can effectively rectify over-pruning in SLR and improve its classification accuracy. We also conduct an fMRI experiment in which eight healthy volunteers perform a finger-tapping task with their index or middle fingers. The results indicate that SLR with iRec (iSLR) can predict the finger used more accurately than SLR. Further, iSLR is able to identify a voxel cluster representing the finger movements in the biologically plausible contralateral primary sensory-motor cortices in each participant. We also successfully dissociated the regularly arranged representation for each finger in the cluster. Conclusion and comparison with other methods: To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to propose a solution for over-pruning with ensemble-learning that is applicable to any sparse algorithm.

The PS is frequently estimated using main-effects logistic regression. However, the underlying model assumptions may not hold. Machine learning methods provide an alternative nonparametric approach to PS estimation. In this simulation study, we evaluated the benefit of using Super Learner (SL) for PS estimation. We created 1,000 simulated data sets (n = 500) under 4 different scenarios characterized by various degrees of deviance from the usual main-term logistic regression model for the true PS. We estimated the average treatment effect using PS matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting. The estimators' performance was evaluated in terms of PS prediction accuracy, covariate balance achieved, bias, standard error, coverage, and mean squared error. All methods exhibited adequate overall balancing properties, but in the case of model misspecification, SL performed better for highly unbalanced variables. The SL-based estimators were associated with the smallest bias in cases of severe model misspecification. Our results suggest that use of SL to estimate the PS can improve covariate balance and reduce bias in a meaningful manner in cases of serious model misspecification for treatment assignment.

Due to their size and numbers of attributes, these data are suitable for analysis with machine learning methods. A key component of typical machine learning pipelines for omics data is feature selection, which is used to reduce the raw high-dimensional data into a tractable number of features. Feature selection needs to balance the objective of using as few features as possible, while maintaining high predictive power. This balance is crucial when the goal of data analysis is the identification of highly accurate but small panels of biomarkers with potential clinical utility. In this paper we propose a heuristic for the selection of very small feature subsets, via an iterative feature elimination process that is guided by rule-based machine learning, called RGIFE (Rule-guided Iterative Feature Elimination). We use this heuristic to identify putative biomarkers of osteoarthritis (OA), articular cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation, using both proteomic and transcriptomic datasets. Results and discussion: Our RGIFE heuristic increased the classification accuracies achieved for all datasets when no feature selection is used, and performed well in a comparison with other feature selection methods. Using this method the datasets were reduced to a smaller number of genes or proteins, including those known to be relevant to OA, cartilage degradation and joint inflammation. The results have shown the RGIFE feature reduction method to be suitable for analysing both proteomic and transcriptomics data. Methods that generate large 'omics' datasets are increasingly being used in the area of rheumatology. Conclusions: Feature reduction methods are advantageous for the analysis of omics data in the field of rheumatology, as the applications of such techniques are likely to result in improvements in diagnosis, treatment and drug discovery.

In particular, rare copy number variation (CNV) contributes to ASD risk in up to 10% of ASD subjects. Despite the striking degree of genetic heterogeneity, case-control studies have detected specific burden of rare disruptive CNV for neuronal and neurodevelopmental pathways. Here, we used machine learning methods to classify ASD subjects and controls, based on rare CNV data and comprehensive gene annotations. We investigated performance of different methods and estimated the percentage of ASD subjects that could be reliably classified based on presumed etiologic CNV they carry. Results: We analyzed 1,892 Caucasian ASD subjects and 2,342 matched controls. Rare CNVs (frequency 1% or less) were detected using Illumina 1M and 1M-Duo BeadChips. Conditional Inference Forest (CF) typically performed as well as or better than other classification methods. We found a maximum AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.533 when considering all ASD subjects with rare genic CNVs, corresponding to 7.9% correctly classified ASD subjects and less than 3% incorrectly classified controls; performance was significantly higher when considering only subjects harboring de novo or pathogenic CNVs. We also found rare losses to be more predictive than gains and that curated neurally-relevant annotations (brain expression, synaptic components and neurodevelopmental phenotypes) outperform Gene Ontology and pathway-based annotations. Conclusions: CF is an optimal classification approach for case-control rare CNV data and it can be used to prioritize subjects with variants potentially contributing to ASD risk not yet recognized. The neurally-relevant annotations used in this study could be successfully applied to rare CNV case-control data-sets for other neuropsychiatric disorders.

To this end, a specific labeling of each compound was elaborated in order to infer virtual screening models against multiple targets. We compared the method with several state-of-the-art SVM classification techniques that are capable of inferring multi-target screening models on three chemical data sets (cytochrome P450s, dehydrogenases, and a trypsin-like protease data set) containing three different biological targets each. Results: The experiments show that ranking-based algorithms show an increased performance for single- and multi-target virtual screening. Moreover, compounds that do not completely fulfill the desired activity profile are still ranked higher than decoys or compounds with an entirely undesired profile, compared to other multi-target SVM methods. Conclusions: SVM-based ranking methods constitute a valuable approach for virtual screening in multi-target drug design. The utilization of such methods is most helpful when dealing with compounds with various activity profiles and the finding of many ligands with an already perfectly matching activity profile is not to be expected.

Instead of obtaining rules by attribute reduction, which may have a negative effect on inducting good rules, the objective of this paper is to extract rules without computing attribute reducts. Forward and backward approximations in fuzzy rough sets are first defined, and their important properties are discussed. Two algorithms based on forward and backward approximations, namely, mine rules based on the forward approximation (MRBFA) and mine rules based on the backward approximation (MRBBA), are proposed for rule extraction. The two algorithms are evaluated by several data sets from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results show that both MRBFA and MRBBA achieve better classification performances than the method based on attribute reduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Strategy for Identifying Repurposed Drugs for the Treatment of Cerebral Cavernous Malformation	CIRCULATION			English	Article						cerebrovascular disorders; endothelium; genetics; hemorrhage; stroke	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; IMAGE-BASED SCREENS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ENDOTHELIAL PERMEABILITY; VASCULAR-PERMEABILITY; TRUNCATING MUTATIONS; SOMATIC MUTATIONS; SIGNALING PATHWAY; ANALYSIS SOFTWARE; CCM PATHOGENESIS	Background-Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a hemorrhagic stroke disease affecting up to 0.5% of North Americans that has no approved nonsurgical treatment. A subset of patients have a hereditary form of the disease due primarily to loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. We sought to identify known drugs that could be repurposed to treat CCM. Methods and Results-We developed an unbiased screening platform based on both cellular and animal models of loss of function of CCM2. Our discovery strategy consisted of 4 steps: an automated immunofluorescence and machine-learning-ased primary screen of structural phenotypes in human endothelial cells deficient in CCM2, a secondary screen of functional changes in endothelial stability in these same cells, a rapid in vivo tertiary screen of dermal microvascular leak in mice lacking endothelial Ccm2, and finally a quaternary screen of CCM lesion burden in these same mice. We screened 2100 known drugs and bioactive compounds and identified 2 candidates, cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) and tempol (a scavenger of superoxide), for further study. Each drug decreased lesion burden in a mouse model of CCM vascular disease by approximate to 50%. Conclusions-By identifying known drugs as potential therapeutics for CCM, we have decreased the time, cost, and risk of bringing treatments to patients. Each drug also prompts additional exploration of biomarkers of CCM disease. We further suggest that the structure-function screening platform presented here may be adapted and scaled to facilitate drug discovery for diverse loss-of-function genetic vascular disease.

In cancer cells, signalling pathways are altered to satisfy the demands of continuous proliferation and survival. The changes in signalling pathways supporting uncontrolled cell growth, termed as rewiring, can lead to dysregulation of cell fates e.g. apoptosis. Hence comparative analysis of normal and oncogenic signal transduction pathways may provide insights into mechanisms of cancer drug-resistance and facilitate the discovery of novel and effective anti-cancer therapies. Here we propose a hybrid modelling approach based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) and machine learning to map network rewiring in the apoptotic pathways that may be responsible for the increase of drug sensitivity of tumour cells in triple-negative breast cancer. Our method employs Genetic Algorithm to search for the most likely network topologies by iteratively generating simulated protein phosphorylation data using ODEs and the rewired network and then fitting the simulated data with real data of cancer signalling and cell fate. Most of our predictions are consistent with experimental evidence from literature. Combining the strengths of knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches, our hybrid model can help uncover molecular mechanisms of cancer cell fate at systems level.

J	Nguyen, TT; Huang, JZ; Wu, QY; Nguyen, TT; Li, MJ				Thanh-Tung Nguyen; Huang, Joshua Zhexue; Wu, Qingyao; Thuy Thi Nguyen; Li, Mark Junjie			Genome-wide association data classification and SNPs selection using two-stage quality-based Random Forests	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; VARIABLE IMPORTANCE MEASURES; HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; STATISTICAL-METHODS; DISEASES	Background: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selection and identification are the most important tasks in Genome-wide association data analysis. The problem is difficult because genome-wide association data is very high dimensional and a large portion of SNPs in the data is irrelevant to the disease. Advanced machine learning methods have been successfully used in Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identification of genetic variants that have relatively big effects in some common, complex diseases. Among them, the most successful one is Random Forests (RF). Despite of performing well in terms of prediction accuracy in some data sets with moderate size, RF still suffers from working in GWAS for selecting informative SNPs and building accurate prediction models. In this paper, we propose to use a new two-stage quality-based sampling method in random forests, named ts-RF, for SNP subspace selection for GWAS. The method first applies p-value assessment to find a cut-off point that separates informative and irrelevant SNPs in two groups. The informative SNPs group is further divided into two sub-groups: highly informative and weak informative SNPs. When sampling the SNP subspace for building trees for the forest, only those SNPs from the two sub-groups are taken into account. The feature subspaces always contain highly informative SNPs when used to split a node at a tree. Results: This approach enables one to generate more accurate trees with a lower prediction error, meanwhile possibly avoiding overfitting. It allows one to detect interactions of multiple SNPs with the diseases, and to reduce the dimensionality and the amount of Genome-wide association data needed for learning the RF model. Extensive experiments on two genome-wide SNP data sets (Parkinson case-control data comprised of 408,803 SNPs and Alzheimer case-control data comprised of 380,157 SNPs) and 10 gene data sets have demonstrated that the proposed model significantly reduced prediction errors and outperformed most existing the-state-of-the-art random forests. The top 25 SNPs in Parkinson data set were identified by the proposed model including four interesting genes associated with neurological disorders. Conclusion: The presented approach has shown to be effective in selecting informative sub-groups of SNPs potentially associated with diseases that traditional statistical approaches might fail. The new RF works well for the data where the number of case-control objects is much smaller than the number of SNPs, which is a typical problem in gene data and GWAS. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed RF model that outperformed the state-ofthe- art RFs, including Breiman's RF, GRRF and wsRF methods.

J	Kainz, P; Mayrhofer-Reinhartshuber, M; Ahammer, H				Kainz, Philipp; Mayrhofer-Reinhartshuber, Michael; Ahammer, Helmut			IQM: An Extensible and Portable Open Source Application for Image and Signal Analysis in Java	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE; PHYSIOLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS; FRACTAL DIMENSION; GENERALIZED DIMENSIONS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; DIGITAL IMAGES; PLATFORM; CLASSIFICATION; ENTROPY	Image and signal analysis applications are substantial in scientific research. Both open source and commercial packages provide a wide range of functions for image and signal analysis, which are sometimes supported very well by the communities in the corresponding fields. Commercial software packages have the major drawback of being expensive and having undisclosed source code, which hampers extending the functionality if there is no plugin interface or similar option available. However, both variants cannot cover all possible use cases and sometimes custom developments are unavoidable, requiring open source applications. In this paper we describe IQM, a completely free, portable and open source (GNU GPLv3) image and signal analysis application written in pure Java. IQM does not depend on any natively installed libraries and is therefore runnable out-of-the-box. Currently, a continuously growing repertoire of 50 image and 16 signal analysis algorithms is provided. The modular functional architecture based on the three-tier model is described along the most important functionality. Extensibility is achieved using operator plugins, and the development of more complex workflows is provided by a Groovy script interface to the JVM. We demonstrate IQM's image and signal processing capabilities in a proof-of-principle analysis and provide example implementations to illustrate the plugin framework and the scripting interface. IQM integrates with the popular ImageJ image processing software and is aiming at complementing functionality rather than competing with existing open source software. Machine learning can be integrated into more complex algorithms via the WEKA software package as well, enabling the development of transparent and robust methods for image and signal analysis.

Data Mining Strategies to Improve Multiplex Microbead Immunoassay Tolerance in a Mouse Model of Infectious Diseases	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SIMULTANEOUS SERODETECTION; TRANSGENIC MICE; VIRUS; PARVOVIRUS; CYTOKINES; ASSAY	Multiplex methodologies, especially those with high-throughput capabilities generate large volumes of data. Accumulation of such data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.) is fast becoming more common and thus requires the development and implementation of effective data mining strategies designed for biological and clinical applications. Multiplex microbead immunoassay (MMIA), on xMAP or MagPix platform (Luminex), which is amenable to automation, offers a major advantage over conventional methods such as Western blot or ELISA, for increasing the efficiencies in serodiagnosis of infectious diseases. MMIA allows detection of antibodies and/or antigens efficiently for a wide range of infectious agents simultaneously in host blood samples, in one reaction vessel. In the process, MMIA generates large volumes of data. In this report we demonstrate the application of data mining tools on how the inherent large volume data can improve the assay tolerance (measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity) by analysis of experimental data accumulated over a span of two years. The combination of prior knowledge with machine learning tools provides an efficient approach to improve the diagnostic power of the assay in a continuous basis. Furthermore, this study provides an in-depth knowledge base to study pathological trends of infectious agents in mouse colonies on a multivariate scale. Data mining techniques using serodetection of infections in mice, developed in this study, can be used as a general model for more complex applications in epidemiology and clinical translational research.

Machine learning based miRNA target prediction algorithms first extract a set of features from potential binding sites (PBSs) in the mRNA and then train a classifier to distinguish targets from non-targets. However, they do not consider whether the PBSs are functional or not, and consequently result in high false positive rates. This substantially affects the follow up functional validation by experiments. We present a novel machine learning based approach, MBSTAR (Multiple instance learning of Binding Sites of miRNA TARgets), for accurate prediction of true or functional miRNA binding sites. Multiple instance learning framework is adopted to handle the lack of information about the actual binding sites in the target mRNAs. Biologically validated 9531 interacting and 973 non-interacting miRNA-mRNA pairs are identified from Tarbase 6.0 and confirmed with PAR-CLIP dataset. It is found that MBSTAR achieves the highest number of binding sites overlapping with PAR-CLIP with maximum F-Score of 0.337. Compared to the other methods, MBSTAR also predicts target mRNAs with highest accuracy.

Quantifying small molecule phenotypic effects using mitochondrial morpho-functional fingerprinting and machine learning	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							COMPLEX-I DEFICIENCY; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; DISORDERS; TROLOX; MORPHOLOGY; ORGANELLE; DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; FIBROBLASTS	In primary fibroblasts from Leigh Syndrome (LS) patients, isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency is associated with increased reactive oxygen species levels and mitochondrial morpho-functional changes. Empirical evidence suggests these aberrations constitute linked therapeutic targets for small chemical molecules. However, the latter generally induce multiple subtle effects, meaning that in vitro potency analysis or single-parameter high-throughput cell screening are of limited use to identify these molecules. We combine automated image quantification and artificial intelligence to discriminate between primary fibroblasts of a healthy individual and a LS patient based upon their mitochondrial morpho-functional phenotype. We then evaluate the effects of newly developed Trolox variants in LS patient cells. This revealed that Trolox ornithylamide hydrochloride best counterbalanced mitochondrial morpho-functional aberrations, effectively scavenged ROS and increased the maximal activity of mitochondrial complexes I, IV and citrate synthase. Our results suggest that Trolox-derived antioxidants are promising candidates in therapy development for human mitochondrial disorders.

J	Wu, YY; Kosinski, M; Stillwell, D				Wu Youyou; Kosinski, Michal; Stillwell, David			Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						personality judgment; social media; computational social science; artificial intelligence; big data	SELF-OTHER AGREEMENT; INTERJUDGE AGREEMENT; TRAITS; ACQUAINTANCESHIP; PERSPECTIVE; CONSENSUS; IMPRESSIONS; SIMILARITY; JUDGE; MODEL	Judging others' personalities is an essential skill in successful social living, as personality is a key driver behind people's interactions, behaviors, and emotions. Although accurate personality judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants' Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher inter-judge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.

Methods: Data from healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with AMD or other retinal diseases were collected during routine visits via an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Patients' attributes included demographics and, for each eye, presence/absence of major AMD-related clinical signs (soft drusen, retinal pigment epitelium, defects/pigment mottling, depigmentation area, subretinal haemorrhage, subretinal fluid, macula thickness, macular scar, subretinal fibrosis). Interpretable techniques known as white box methods including logistic regression and decision trees as well as less interpreitable techniques known as black box methods, such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests and AdaBoost, were used to develop models (trained and validated on unseen data) to diagnose AMD. The gold standard was confirmed diagnosis of AMD by physicians. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) were used to assess performance. Results: Study population included 487 patients (912 eyes). In terms of AUC, random forests, logistic regression and adaboost showed a mean performance of (0.92), followed by SVM and decision trees (0.90). All machine learning models identified soft drusen and age as the most discriminating variables in clinicians' decision pathways to diagnose AMD. Conclusions: Both black-box and white box methods performed well in identifying diagnoses of AMD and their decision pathways. Machine learning models developed through the proposed approach, relying on clinical signs identified by retinal specialists, could be embedded into EHR to provide physicians with real time (interpretable) support.

Salmonella bacteria are believed to use not only animal and human but also plant hosts despite their evolutionary distance. This raises the question if Salmonella employs similar mechanisms in infection of these diverse hosts. Given that most of our understanding comes from its interaction with human hosts, we investigate here to what degree knowledge of Salmonella-human interactions can be transferred to the Salmonella-plant system. Reviewed are recent publications on analysis and prediction of Salmonella-host interactomes. Putative protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between Salmonella and its human and Arabidopsis hosts were retrieved utilizing purely interolog-based approaches in which predictions were inferred based on available sequence and domain information of known PP1s, and machine learning approaches that integrate a larger set of useful information from different sources. Transfer learning is an especially suitable machine learning technique to predict plant host targets from the knowledge of human host targets. A comparison of the prediction results with transcriptornic data shows a clear overlap between the host proteins predicted to be targeted by PPIs and their gene ontology enrichment in both host species and regulation of gene expression. In particular, the cellular processes Salmonella interferes with in plants and humans are catabolic processes. The details of how these processes are targeted, however, are quite different between the two organisms, as expected based on their evolutionary and habitat differences. Possible implications of this observation on evolution of host-pathogen communication are discussed.

Quantitative differences in developmental profiles of spontaneous activity in cortical and hippocampal cultures	NEURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Multielectrode array; Spontaneous activity; Cortex; Hippocampus; Principal component analysis; Support vector machine; Classification tree	RAT VISUAL-CORTEX; RETINAL WAVES; MICROELECTRODE ARRAYS; SPINDLE BURSTS; IN-VITRO; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; VIVO	Background: Neural circuits can spontaneously generate complex spatiotemporal firing patterns during development. This spontaneous activity is thought to help guide development of the nervous system. In this study, we had two aims. First, to characterise the changes in spontaneous activity in cultures of developing networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons dissociated from mouse. Second, to assess whether there are any functional differences in the patterns of activity in hippocampal and cortical networks. Results: We used multielectrode arrays to record the development of spontaneous activity in cultured networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons every 2 or 3 days for the first month after plating. Within a few days of culturing, networks exhibited spontaneous activity. This activity strengthened and then stabilised typically around 21 days in vitro. We quantified the activity patterns in hippocampal and cortical networks using 11 features. Three out of 11 features showed striking differences in activity between hippocampal and cortical networks: (1) interburst intervals are less variable in spike trains from hippocampal cultures; (2) hippocampal networks have higher correlations and (3) hippocampal networks generate more robust theta-bursting patterns. Machine-learning techniques confirmed that these differences in patterning are sufficient to classify recordings reliably at any given age as either hippocampal or cortical networks. Conclusions: Although cultured networks of hippocampal and cortical networks both generate spontaneous activity that changes over time, at any given time we can reliably detect differences in the activity patterns. We anticipate that this quantitative framework could have applications in many areas, including neurotoxicity testing and for characterising the phenotype of different mutant mice.

J	Zhang, JB; Wong, JS; Pan, Y; Li, TR				Zhang, Junbo; Wong, Jian-Syuan; Pan, Yi; Li, Tianrui			A Parallel Matrix-Based Method for Computing Approximations in Incomplete Information Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Rough sets; data mining; MapReduce; matrix; incomplete information systems	ROUGH SET-THEORY; ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; MAPREDUCE; SELECTION	As the volume of data grows at an unprecedented rate, large-scale data mining and knowledge discovery present a tremendous challenge. Rough set theory, which has been used successfully in solving problems in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining, centers around the idea that a set of distinct objects may be approximated via a lower and upper bound. In order to obtain the benefits that rough sets can provide for data mining and related tasks, efficient computation of these approximations is vital. The recently introduced cloud computing model, MapReduce, has gained a lot of attention from the scientific community for its applicability to large-scale data analysis. In previous research, we proposed a MapReduce-based method for computing approximations in parallel, which can efficiently process complete data but fails in the case of missing (incomplete) data. To address this shortcoming, three different parallel matrix-based methods are introduced to process large-scale, incomplete data. All of them are built on MapReduce and implemented on Twister that is a lightweight MapReduce runtime system. The proposed parallel methods are then experimentally shown to be efficient for processing large-scale data.

In their work, they try to find relationships between the performance of some methods from this field and the values of some data-complexity measures, with the aim of determining the best performing method given a data set, using only the values of the measures computed on this data. Nevertheless, most of the data-complexity measures existing in the literature were not conceived for this purpose and the feasibility of their use in this field is yet to be determined. In this paper, we revise the definition of some measures that we presented in a previous work, that were designed for meta-learning based instance selection. Also, we assess them in an experimental study involving three sets of measures, 59 databases, 16 instance selection methods, two classifiers, and eight regression learners used as meta-learners. The results suggest that our measures are more efficient and effective than those traditionally used by researchers that have addressed the instance selection from a perspective based on meta-learning.

To cope with this problem, hyperspectral band selection is a pertinent technique, which takes advantage of removing redundant components without compromising the original contents from the raw image cubes. Because of its usefulness, hyperspectral band selection has been successfully applied to many practical applications of hyperspectral remote sensing, such as land cover map generation and color visualization. This paper focuses on groupwise band selection and proposes a new framework, including the following contributions: 1) a smart yet intrinsic descriptor for efficient band representation; 2) an evolutionary strategy to handle the high computational burden associated with groupwise-selection-based methods; and 3) a novel MTSP-based criterion to evaluate the performance of each candidate band combination. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework, experiments have been conducted on both hyperspectral classification and color visualization. Experimental results on three real-world hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed framework can lead to a significant advancement in these two applications compared with other competitors.

J	Nitze, I; Barrett, B; Cawkwell, F				Nitze, Ingmar; Barrett, Brian; Cawkwell, Fiona			Temporal optimisation of image acquisition for land cover classification with Random Forest and MODIS time-series	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article						Land cover classification; Random Forest; MODIS; Machine-learning	FEATURE-SELECTION; NDVI DATA; AVHRR NDVI; DATA SET; DYNAMICS; AUSTRALIA; SCALE	The analysis and classification of land cover is one of the principal applications in terrestrial remote sensing. Due to the seasonal variability of different vegetation types and land surface characteristics, the ability to discriminate land cover types changes over time. Multi-temporal classification can help to improve the classification accuracies, but different constraints, such as financial restrictions or atmospheric conditions, may impede their application. The optimisation of image acquisition timing and frequencies can help to increase the effectiveness of the classification process. For this purpose, the Feature Importance (FI) measure of the state-of-the art machine learning method Random Forest was used to determine the optimal image acquisition periods for a general (Grassland, Forest, Water, Settlement, Peatland) and Grassland specific (Improved Grassland, Semi-Improved Grassland) land cover classification in central Ireland based on a 9-year time-series of MODE Terra 16 day composite data (MOD13Q1). Feature Importances for each acquisition period of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated for both classification scenarios. In the general land cover classification, the months December and January showed the highest, and July and August the lowest separability for both VIs over the entire nine-year period. This temporal separability was reflected in the classification accuracies, where the optimal choice of image dates outperformed the worst image date by 13% using NDVI and 5% using EVI on a mono-temporal analysis. With the addition of the next best image periods to the data input the classification accuracies converged quickly to their limit at around 8-10 images. The binary classification schemes, using two classes only, showed a stronger seasonal dependency with a higher intra-annual, but lower inter-annual variation. Nonetheless anomalous weather conditions, such as the cold winter of 2009/2010 can alter the temporal separability pattern significantly. Due to the extensive use of the NDVI for land cover discrimination, the findings of this study should be transferrable to data from other optical sensors with a higher spatial resolution. However, the high impact of outliers from the general climatic pattern highlights the limitation of spatial transferability to locations with different climatic and land cover conditions. The use of high-temporal, moderate resolution data such as MODIS in conjunction with machine-learning techniques proved to be a good base for the prediction of image acquisition timing for optimal land cover classification results.

J	Amirian, E; Leung, JY; Zanon, S; Dzurman, P				Amirian, Ehsan; Leung, Juliana Y.; Zanon, Stefan; Dzurman, Peter			Integrated cluster analysis and artificial neural network modeling for steam-assisted gravity drainage performance prediction in heterogeneous reservoirs	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Thermal recovery; Heavy oil; Data-driven; Artificial neural networks; Principal components; Cluster analysis	VIRTUAL-INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; WATER TURBIDITE RESERVOIR; FUZZY-LOGIC; GAS-RESERVOIRS; SEISMIC DATA; OPTIMIZATION; FIELD; OIL	Evaluation of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) performance that involves detailed compositional simulations is usually deterministic, cumbersome, expensive (manpower and time consuming), and not quite suitable for practical decision making and forecasting, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data space consisting of large number of operational and geological parameters. Data-driven modeling techniques, which entail comprehensive data analysis and implementation of machine learning methods for system forecast, provide an attractive alternative. In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict SAGD production in heterogeneous reservoirs, an important application that is lacking in existing literature. Numerical flow simulations are performed to construct a training data set consists of various attributes describing characteristics associated with reservoir heterogeneities and other relevant operating parameters. Empirical Arps decline parameters are tested successfully for parameterization of cumulative production profile and considered as outputs of the ANN models. Sensitivity studies on network configurations are also investigated. Principal components analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the input vector, improve prediction quality, and limit over-fitting. In a case study, reservoirs with distinct heterogeneity distributions are fed to the model. It is shown that robustness and accuracy of the prediction capability are greatly enhanced when cluster analysis are performed to identify internal data structures and groupings prior to ANN modeling. Both deterministic and fuzzy-based clustering techniques are compared, and separate ANN model is constructed for each cluster. The model is then tested using a validation data set (cases that have not been used during the training stage). The proposed approach can be integrated directly into most existing reservoir management routines. In addition, incorporating techniques for dimensionality reduction and clustering with ANN demonstrates the viability of this approach for analyzing large field data set. Given that quantitative ranking of operating areas, robust forecasting, and optimization of heavy oil recovery processes are major challenges faced by the industry, the proposed research highlights the significant potential of applying effective data-driven modeling approaches in analyzing other solvent-additive steam injection projects.

Specifically, we apply two decomposition approaches-one versus all, and one versus one- to multi-class classification problems, and develop an efficient iterative genetic algorithm with flexible chromosomes and multiple populations (IGA-FCMP). The suggested algorithm has two control parameters for improving the classification accuracy of the generated patterns: (i) the number of patterns to select at the termination of the genetic procedure; and (ii) the number of times that an observation is covered by some patterns until it is omitted from further consideration. By using six well-known datasets available from the UCI machine-learning repository, we performed a numerical experiment to show the superiority of the IGA-FCMP over existing multi-class LAD and other supervised learning algorithms, in terms of the classification accuracy.

A classification algorithm based on geometric and statistical information	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Machine learning; Classification; Distance-frequency	K-NN CLASSIFIER	Classification is a long standing problem in computing. There are two broad kinds of classifiers, frequency based and geometry based. Frequency based classifiers often ignore the geometry underlying the data. Conversely, geometry based classifiers take into account the frequency only indirectly. This paper presents a classification algorithm which considers explicitly geometric and statistical characteristics of the data and combines them into a class representation. Reported here are initial experiments with this algorithm using two well known data sets, both with and without noise. The results show that the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to the training data set than other classifiers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Independence from baseline references is achieved using unsupervised discrimination machine-learning methods, widely known as clustering algorithms, which are able to find groups in data relying only on their intrinsic features and without requiring prior knowledge as input. Real-time capability is based on the definition of symbolic data, which allows describing large amounts of information without loss of generality or structural-related information. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is illustrated using an experimental case study in which structural changes were imposed to a suspended bridge during an extensive rehabilitation programme. A single-value novelty index capable of describing multisensory data is proposed, and its effectiveness in identifying structural changes in real time, using outlier analysis, is discussed.

However, a number of real-world applications require a model but have little or no data available of the specific environment. Predominantly, standard machine learning approaches focus on a need for training data for such models to come from the same domain as the target task. Such restrictions can severely reduce the data acquisition making it extremely costly, or in certain situations, impossible. This impedes the ability of these approaches to model such environments. It is on this particular problem that this paper is focussed. In this paper two concepts, Transfer Learning (TL) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) are combined in a framework, Fuzzy Transfer Learning (FuzzyTL), to address the problem of learning tasks that have no prior direct contextual knowledge. Through the use of a FL based learning method, uncertainty that is evident in dynamic environments is represented. By applying a TL approach through the combining of labelled data from a contextually related source task, and little or no unlabelled data from a target task, the framework is shown to be able to accomplish predictive tasks using models learned from contextually different data.

The most important issues when developing this kind of environments is testing and validating such services. These tasks usually imply high costs and annoying or unfeasible real-world testing. In such cases, artificial societies may be used to simulate the smart environment (i.e. physical environment, equipment and humans). With this aim, the CHROMUBE methodology guides test engineers when modeling human beings. Such models reproduce behaviors which are highly similar to the real ones. Originally, these models are based on automata whose transitions are governed by random variables. Automaton's structure and the probability distribution functions of each random variable are determined by a manual test and error process. In this paper, it is presented an alternative extension of this methodology which avoids the said manual process. It is based on learning human behavior patterns automatically from sensor data by using machine learning techniques. The presented approach has been tested on a real scenario, where this extension has given highly accurate human behavior models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Such information can be used to improve operational planning. This paper describes an AVL-based evaluation framework to test whether the actual Schedule Plan fits, in terms of days covered by each schedule, the network's operational conditions. Firstly, clustering is employed to group days with similar profiles in terms of travel times (this is done for each different route). Secondly, consensus clustering is used to obtain a unique set of clusters for all routes. Finally, a set of rules about the groups content is drawn based on appropriate decision variables. Each group will correspond to a different schedule and the rules identify the days covered by each schedule. This methodology is simultaneously an evaluator of the schedules that are offered by the company (regarding its coverage) and an advisor on possible changes to such offer. It was tested by using data collected for one year in a company running in Porto, Portugal. The results are sound. The main contribution of this paper is that it proposes a way to combine Machine Learning techniques to add a novel dimension to the Schedule Plan evaluation methods: the day coverage. Such approach meets no parallel in the current literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fault diagnosis of automobile hydraulic brake system using statistical features and support vector machines	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Decision tree; Statistical features; C4.5 algorithm; SVM; Kernel function; RBF	DECISION TREE; ROTATING MACHINERY; FUZZY CLASSIFIER; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROLLER BEARING	Hydraulic brakes in automobiles are important components for the safety of passengers; therefore, the brakes are a good subject for condition monitoring. The condition of the brake components can be monitored by using the vibration characteristics. On-line condition monitoring by using machine learning approach is proposed in this paper as a possible solution to such problems. The vibration signals for both good as well as faulty conditions of brakes were acquired from a hydraulic brake test setup with the help of a piezoelectric transducer and a data acquisition system. Descriptive statistical features were extracted from the acquired vibration signals and the feature selection was carried out using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. There is no specific method to find the right number of features required for classification for a given problem. Hence an extensive study is needed to find the optimum number of features. The effect of the number of features was also studied, by using the decision tree as well as Support Vector Machines (SVM). The selected features were classified using the C-SVM and Nu-SVM with different kernel functions. The results are discussed and the conclusion of the study is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

From this point of view, graph kernels provide a nice framework which allows to naturally combine machine learning and graph theory techniques. Graph kernels based on bags of patterns have proven their efficiency on several problems both in terms of accuracy and computational time. Treelet kernel is a graph kernel based on a bag of small subtrees. We propose in this paper several extensions of this kernel devoted to chemoinformatics problems. These extensions aim to weight each pattern according to its influence, to include the comparison of non-isomorphic patterns, to include stereo information and finally to explicitly encode cyclic information into kernel computation.

The working principle of Microtox (R) analyzer is based on a registration of luminescence from Vibrio fischeri bacteria. This luminescence depends on metabolism conditions and toxicity of the environment. Due to the fact that metabolism is influenced by multiple parameters the method is associated with certain limitations. Unlike this bioassay procedure the employment of multisensor system does not require the use of living organisms and can provide for faster toxicity evaluation. Fifty-five real and model polluted water samples, for which the toxicity was established by bioassay, were studied. The response of multisensor array processed with machine learning techniques allows for prediction of toxicity in terms of EC50 with relative errors of 20-25%. Taking into account the complexity of the task (simulation of complex biological reactions with inanimate instrument) this can be considered as a good promise for further research in this direction in order to develop instrumental alternative for toxicity assessment.

J	Lopez-Martin, C				Lopez-Martin, Cuauhtemoc			Predictive accuracy comparison between neural networks and statistical regression for development effort of software projects	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Software development effort prediction; Radial Basis Function Neural Network; Feedforward multilayer perceptron; General regression neural network; Statistical regression; ISBSG data set	COST ESTIMATION; ESTIMATION MODELS; SOURCE LINES; VALIDATION; JUDGMENT; CODE	To get a better prediction of costs, schedule, and the risks of a software project, it is necessary to have a more accurate prediction of its development effort. Among the main prediction techniques are those based on mathematical models, such as statistical regressions or machine learning (ML). The ML models applied to predicting the development effort have mainly based their conclusions on the following weaknesses: (1) using an accuracy criterion which leads to asymmetry, (2) applying a validation method that causes a conclusion instability by randomly selecting the samples for training and testing the models, (3) omitting the explanation of how the parameters for the neural networks were determined, (4) generating conclusions from models that were not trained and tested from mutually exclusive data sets, (5) omitting an analysis of the dependence, variance and normality of data for selecting the suitable statistical test for comparing the accuracies among models, and (6) reporting results without showing a statistically significant difference. In this study, these six issues are addressed when comparing the prediction accuracy of a radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) with that of a regression statistical (the model most frequently compared with ML models), to feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP, the most commonly used in the effort prediction of software projects), and to general regression neural network (GRNN, a RBFNN variant). The hypothesis tested is the following: the accuracy of effort prediction for RBFNN is statistically better than the accuracy obtained from a simple linear regression (SLR), MLP and GRNN when adjusted function points data, obtained from software projects, is used as the independent variable. Samples obtained from the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) Release 11 related to new and enhanced projects were used. The models were trained and tested from a leave-one-out cross-validation method. The criteria for evaluating the models were based on Absolute Residuals and by a Friedman statistical test. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the accuracy among the four models for new projects, but not for enhanced projects. Regarding new projects, the accuracy for RBFNN was better than for a SLR at the 99% confidence level, whereas the MLP and GRNN were better than for a SLR at the 90% confidence level.

There are various machine learning techniques used in the past for predicting faults. Method: In this study we perform a systematic review of studies from January 1991 to October 2013 in the literature that use the machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. We assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. We also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. Further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized. Results: In this paper we have identified 64 primary studies and seven categories of the machine learning techniques. The results prove the prediction capability of the machine learning techniques for classifying module/class as fault prone or not fault prone. The models using the machine learning techniques for estimating software fault proneness outperform the traditional statistical models. Conclusion: Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability for predicting software fault proneness and can be used by software practitioners and researchers. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in software fault prediction is still limited and more number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite growing interest in epigenetic studies of psychiatric diseases, the methodologies guiding such studies have not been well defined. METHODS: We performed DNA modification analysis in white blood cells from monozygotic twins discordant for MDD, in brain prefrontal cortex, and germline (sperm) samples from affected individuals and control subjects (total N = 304) using 8.1K CpG island microarrays and fine mapping. In addition to the traditional locus-by-locus comparisons, we explored the potential of new analytical approaches in epigenomic studies. RESULTS: In the microarray experiment, we detected a number of nominally significant DNA modification differences in MDD and validated selected targets using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Some MDD epigenetic changes, however, overlapped across brain, blood, and sperm more often than expected by chance. We also demonstrated that stratification for disease severity and age may increase the statistical power of epimutation detection. Finally, a series of new analytical approaches, such as DNA modification networks and machine-learning algorithms using binary and quantitative depression phenotypes, provided additional insights on the epigenetic contributions to MDD. CONCLUSIONS: Mapping epigenetic differences in MDD (and other psychiatric diseases) is a complex task. However, combining traditional and innovative analytical strategies may lead to identification of disease-specific etiopathogenic epimutations.

J	Deo, RC; Sahin, M				Deo, Ravinesh C.; Sahin, Mehmet			Application of the extreme learning machine algorithm for the prediction of monthly Effective Drought Index in eastern Australia	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Extreme learning machine; Artificial neural network; Drought prediction; Effective Drought Index	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ESTIMATING SOLAR-RADIATION; INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; ANNULAR MODE; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; TURKEY; PRECIPITATION; EVENTS; TRENDS	The prediction of future drought is an effective mitigation tool for assessing adverse consequences of drought events on vital water resources, agriculture, ecosystems and hydrology. Data-driven model predictions using machine learning algorithms are promising tenets for these purposes as they require less developmental time, minimal inputs and are relatively less complex than the dynamic or physical model. This paper authenticates a computationally simple, fast and efficient non-linear algorithm known as extreme learning machine (ELM) for the prediction of Effective Drought Index (EDI) in eastern Australia using input data trained from 1957-2008 and the monthly EDI predicted over the period 2009-2011. The predictive variables for the ELM model were the rainfall and mean, minimum and maximum air temperatures, supplemented by the large-scale climate mode indices of interest as regression covariates, namely the Southern Oscillation Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode and the Indian Ocean Dipole moment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven model a performance comparison in terms of the prediction capabilities and learning speeds was conducted between the proposed ELM algorithm and the conventional artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm trained with Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation. The prediction metrics certified an excellent performance of the ELM over the ANN model for the overall test sites, thus yielding Mean Absolute Errors, Root-Mean Square Errors, Coefficients of Determination and Willmott's Indices of Agreement of 0277, 0.008, 0.892 and 0.93 (for ELM) and 0.602, 0.172, 0578 and 0.92 (for ANN) models. Moreover, the ELM model was executed with learning speed 32 times faster and training speed 6.1 times faster than the ANN model. An improvement in the prediction capability of the drought duration and severity by the ELM model was achieved. Based on these results we aver that out of the two machine learning algorithms tested, the ELM was the more expeditious tool for prediction of drought and its related properties.

Ordinal Logic Regression: A classifier for discovering combinations of binary markers for ordinal outcomes	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Logic regression; Ordinal response; Decision trees	SUSCEPTIBILITY GENES; PERIODONTAL-DISEASE; CANCER; TREES; IDENTIFICATION; BIOMARKERS; FUTURE; MODELS	In medicine, it is often useful to stratify patients according to disease risk, severity, or response to therapy. Since many diseases arise from complex gene gene and gene environment interactions, patient strata may be defined by combinations of genetic and environmental factors. Traditional statistical methods require specifying interactions a priori making it difficult to identify high order interactions. Alternatively, machine learning methods can model complex interactions, however these models are often difficult to interpret in a clinical setting. Logic regression (LR) enables modeling a binary outcome using logical combinations of binary predictors yielding easily interpretable models. However LR, as currently available, cannot model ordinal responses. This paper extends LR to model an ordinal response and the resulting method is called Ordinal Logic Regression (OLR). Several simulations comparing OLR and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) demonstrate that OLR is superior to CART for identifying variable interactions associated with an ordinal response. OLR is applied to data from a study to determine associations between genetic and health factors with severity of adult periodontitis. Ordinal Logic Regression is publicly available on CRAN in the OrdLogReg package, http://cran.r-projectorg/. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Selver, MA				Selver, M. Alper			Exploring Brushlet Based 3D Textures in Transfer Function Specification for Direct Volume Rendering of Abdominal Organs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Brushlets; texture analysis; transfer functions; volume rendering; abdominal imaging	IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; DESIGN; REPRESENTATION; COMPRESSION; TOOL	Intuitive and differentiating domains for transfer function (TF) specification for direct volume rendering is an important research area for producing informative and useful 3D images. One of the emerging branches of this research is the texture based transfer functions. Although several studies in two, three, and four dimensional image processing show the importance of using texture information, these studies generally focus on segmentation. However, TFs can also be built effectively using appropriate texture information. To accomplish this, methods should be developed to collect wide variety of shape, orientation, and texture of biological tissues and organs. In this study, volumetric data (i.e., domain of a TF) is enhanced using brushlet expansion, which represents both low and high frequency textured structures at different quadrants in transform domain. Three methods (i.e., expert based manual, atlas and machine learning based automatic) are proposed for selection of the quadrants. Non-linear manipulation of the complex brushlet coefficients is also used prior to the tiling of selected quadrants and reconstruction of the volume. Applications to abdominal data sets acquired with CT, MR, and PET show that the proposed volume enhancement effectively improves the quality of 3D rendering using well-known TF specification techniques.

So far several algorithms have been proposed to tackle ordinal regression problems from a machine learning perspective. However, most of these algorithms only seek one direction where the projected samples are well ranked. So a common shortcoming of these algorithms is that only one dimension in the sample space is used, which would definitely lose some useful information in its orthogonal subspaces. In this paper, we propose a novel ordinal regression strategy which consists of two stages: firstly orthogonal feature vectors are extracted and then these projector vectors are combined to learn an ordinal regression rule. Compared with previous ordinal regression methods, the proposed strategy can extract multiple features from the original data space. So the performance of ordinal regression could be improved because more information of the data is used. The experimental results on both benchmark and real datasets proves the performance of the proposed method.

Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with gastric cancer were enrolled in this study. Two types of features (information) were collected with the use of DEsCT imaging: conventional features including patient's clinical information (eg, age, gender) and descriptive characteristics on the CT images (eg, location of the lesion, wall thickness at the gastric cardia) and additional spectral CT features extracted from monochromatic images (eg, 60 keV) and material-decomposition images (eg, iodine- and water-density images). The classification results of the CAD system were compared to pathologic findings. Important features can be found out using support vector machine classification method in combination with feature-selection technique thereby helping the radiologists diagnose better. Results: Statistical analysis showed that for the collected cases, the feature "long axis" was significantly different between group A (serosa negative) and group B (serosa positive) (P <.05). By adding quantitative spectral features from several regions of interest (ROls), the total classification accuracy was improved from 83.33% to 90.00%. Two feature ranking algorithms were used in the CAD scheme to derive the top-ranked features. The results demonstrated that low single-energy (approximately 60 key) CT values, tumor size (long axis and short axis), iodine (water) density, and Effective-Z values of ROls were important for classification. These findings concurred with the experience of the radiologist. Conclusions: The CAD system designed using machine-learning algorithms may be used to improve the identification accuracy in the assessment of serosal invasion in patients of gastric cancer with DEsCT imaging and provide some indicators which may be useful in predicting prognosis.

A method for rapid, high-resolution, robust taxonomic profiling of subgingival bacterial communities for early detection of periodontitis biomarkers would therefore be a useful tool for individualized medicine. Here, we used Illumina sequencing of the V1-V2 and V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. A sample stratification pipeline was developed in a pilot study of 19 individuals, 9 of whom had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. Five hundred twenty-three operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from the V1-V2 region and 432 from the V5-V6 region. Key periodontal pathogens like Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia could be identified at the species level with both primer sets. Principal coordinate analysis identified two outliers that were consistently independent of the hypervariable region and method of DNA extraction used. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size algorithm (LEfSe) identified 80 OTU-level biomarkers of periodontitis and 17 of health. Health-and periodontitis-related clusters of OTUs were identified using a connectivity analysis, and the results confirmed previous studies with several thousands of samples. A machine learning algorithm was developed which was trained on all but one sample and then predicted the diagnosis of the left-out sample (jackknife method). Using a combination of the 10 best biomarkers, 15 of 17 samples were correctly diagnosed. Training the algorithm on time-resolved community profiles might provide a highly sensitive tool to detect the onset of periodontitis.

Machine learning algorithms and forced oscillation measurements to categorise the airway obstruction severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Clinical decision support; Classification; Artificial intelligence; Airway obstruction severity; Forced oscillation technique; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	INDUCED RESPIRATORY CHANGES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; IMPEDANCE; COPD; RECOGNITION; MECHANICS; SYSTEM; CLASSIFIERS; SPIROMETRY; DIAGNOSIS	The purpose of this study was to develop automatic classifiers to simplify the clinical use and increase the accuracy of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in the categorisation of airway obstruction level in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The data consisted of FOT parameters obtained from 168 volunteers (42 healthy and 126 COPD subjects with four different levels of obstruction). The first part of this study showed that FOT parameters do not provide adequate accuracy in identifying COPD subjects in the first levels of obstruction, as well as in discriminating between close levels of obstruction. In the second part of this study, different supervised machine learning (ML) techniques were investigated, including k-nearest neighbour (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machines with linear (SVML) and radial basis function kernels (SVMR). These algorithms were applied only in situations where high categorisation accuracy [area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) >= 0.9] was not achieved with the FOT parameter alone. It was observed that KNN and RF classifiers improved categorisation accuracy. Notably, in four of the six cases studied, an AUC >= 0.9 was achieved. Even in situations where an AUC >= 0.9 was not achieved, there was a significant improvement in categorisation performance (AUC >= 0.83). In conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help in the categorisation of COPD airway obstruction. They can assist clinicians in tracking disease progression, evaluating the risk of future disease exacerbations and guiding therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Probabilistic methods of analysis for the time series Moran scatterplot quadrant signature	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; machine learning; spatial statistics; fire modelling; clustering; Dirichlet process	MIXTURE; MODELS	Recently, time series Moran scatterplot quadrant signatures (MSQS) have been introduced as a means of spatio-temporal analysis. Moran scatter plots summarise a set of local Moran statistics that identify how a quantity of interest relates to its neighbours. By reducing these scatter plots to just one of four quadrant locations at fixed time intervals, a time series MSQS is obtained. Clustering on the time series MSQS allows regions that show similar behaviour relative to their neighbours to be identified. It has recently been shown that the Levenshtein metric, a distance metric originally used for string comparison, can be used to construct a kernel that allows standard Ward hierarchical clustering to be applied. The result is that regions with similar spatio-temporal behaviour can be identified. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of Dirichlet Process mixture models as a fully probabilistic alternative to applying Ward hierarchical clustering with the Levenshtein metric. This approach offers an advance to the existing literature as it proposes a fully generative model that articulates the underlying assumptions and allows prediction of new test points. Additionally, it provides a principled method that avoids using heuristics to select the number of clusters. An efficient Gibbs sampling Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is presented, and it is demonstrated how the output of this can be mapped and analysed. Difficulties inherent in mapping and plotting high-dimensional mathematical objects are discussed, and practical solutions are proposed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The autoencoder is one method that can be used for this purpose. However, for data sets with a high degree of noise, a large amount of the representational capacity in the autoencoder is used to minimize the reconstruction error for these noisy inputs. This paper proposes a method that improves the feature learning process by focusing on the task relevant information in the data. This selective attention is achieved by weighting the reconstruction error and reducing the influence of noisy inputs during the learning process. The proposed model is trained on a number of publicly available image data sets and the test error rate is compared to a standard sparse autoencoder and other methods, such as the denoising autoencoder and contractive autoencoder.

In spite of that, developments in the machine learning community in the last decade have mostly focused on mathematical analysis of learning machines, making it difficult for practitioners to recollect an overview of major approaches to this issue. Paradoxically, as a consequence, even established methodologies rooted in statistics appear to have long been forgotten. Although the relevant literature on the topic is so wide that no exhaustive coverage is nowadays possible, the first goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a nonetheless significant survey of major, or utterly sound, techniques for dealing with the tasks of pattern recognition, machine learning, and density estimation from incomplete data. Secondly, the paper aims at representing a viable tutorial tool for the interested practitioner, by allowing for self-contained, step-by-step understanding of several approaches. An effort is made to categorize the different techniques as follows: (1) heuristic methods; (2) statistical approaches; (3) connectionist-oriented techniques; (4) other approaches (dynamical systems, adversarial deletion of features, etc.).

J	Dota, MA; Cugnasca, CE; Barbosa, DS				Dota, Mara Andrea; Cugnasca, Carlos Eduardo; Barbosa, Domingos Savio			Comparative analysis of decision tree algorithms on quality of water contaminated with soil	CIENCIA RURAL			English	Article						environmentalcontrol; runoff; wireless sensor networks; machine learning; data mining	RIVER	Agriculture, roads, animal farms and other land uses may modify the water quality from rivers, dams and other surface freshwaters. In the control of the ecological process and for environmental management, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify surface water contamination (in areas such as rivers and dams) with contaminated runoff waters coming, for example, from cultivation and urban areas. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different classification algorithms applied to the data collected from a sample of soil-contaminated water aiming to identify if the water quality classification proposed in this research agrees with reality. The sample was part of a laboratory experiment, which began with a sample of treated water added with increasing fractions of soil. The results show that the proposed classification for water quality in this scenario is coherent, because different algorithms indicated a strong statistic relationship between the classes and their instances, that is, in the classes that qualify the water sample and the values which describe each class. The proposed water classification varies from excelling to very awful (12 classes).

In this sense, the ADME-Tox profile of a bioactive compound can impact its efficacy and safety. Moreover, efficacy and safety were considered some of the major causes of clinical failures in the development of new chemical entities. In this context, machine learning (ML) techniques have been often used in ADME-Tox studies due to the existence of compounds with known pharmacokinetic properties available for generating predictive models. Areas covered: This review examines the growth in the use of some ML techniques in ADME-Tox studies, in particular supervised and unsupervised techniques. Also, some critical points (e. g., size of the data set and type of output variable) must be considered during the generation of models that relate ADME-Tox properties and biological activity. Expert opinion: ML techniques have been successfully employed in pharmacokinetic studies, helping the complex process of designing new drug candidates from the use of reliable ML models. An application of this procedure would be the prediction of ADME-Tox properties from studies of quantitative structure-activity relationships or the discovery of new compounds from a virtual screening using filters based on results obtained from ML techniques.

Digital soil mapping (DSM) can quantitatively predict the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes. Key components of DSM are the method and the set of environmental covariates used to predict soil classes. Machine learning is a general term for a broad set of statistical modeling techniques. Many different machine learning models have been applied in the literature and there are different approaches for selecting covariates for DSM. However, there is little guidance as to which, if any, machine learning model and covariate set might be optimal for predicting soil classes across different landscapes. Our objective was to compare multiple machine learning models and covariate sets for predicting soil taxonomic classes at three geographically distinct areas in the semi-arid western United States of America (southern New Mexico, southwestern Utah, and northeastern Wyoming). All three areas were the focus of digital soil mapping studies. Sampling sites at each study area were selected using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). We compared models that had been used in other DSM studies, including clustering algorithms, discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression, neural networks, tree based methods, and support vector machine classifiers. Tested machine learning models were divided into three groups based on model complexity: simple, moderate, and complex. We also compared environmental covariates derived from digital elevation models and Landsat imagery that were divided into three different sets: 1) covariates selected a priori by soil scientists familiar with each area and used as input into cLHS, 2) the covariates in set 1 plus 113 additional covariates, and 3) covariates selected using recursive feature elimination. Overall, complex models were consistently more accurate than simple or moderately complex models. Random forests (RF) using covariates selected via recursive feature elimination was consistently the most accurate, or was among the most accurate, classifiers between study areas and between covariate sets within each study area. We recommend that for soil taxonomic class prediction, complex models and covariates selected by recursive feature elimination be used. Overall classification accuracy in each study area was largely dependent upon the number of soil taxonomic classes and the frequency distribution of pedon observations between taxonomic classes. Individual subgroup class accuracy was generally dependent upon the number of soil pedon observations in each taxonomic class. The number of soil classes is related to the inherent variability of a given area. The imbalance of soil pedon observations between classes is likely related to cLHS. Imbalanced frequency distributions of soil pedon observations between classes must be addressed to improve model accuracy. Solutions include increasing the number of soil pedon observations in classes with few observations or decreasing the number of classes. Spatial predictions using the most accurate models generally agree with expected soil landscape relationships. Spatial prediction uncertainty was lowest in areas of relatively low relief for each study area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Trust and Compactness in Social Network Groups	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Decision support systems; machine learning; multiagent systems; social network services; social trust	E-COMMERCE; MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; RECOMMENDATION; COMMUNITIES; SIMILARITY; INTERNET	Understanding the dynamics behind group formation and evolution in social networks is considered an instrumental milestone to better describe how individuals gather and form communities, how they enjoy and share the platform contents, how they are driven by their preferences/tastes, and how their behaviors are influenced by peers. In this context, the notion of compactness of a social group is particularly relevant. While the literature usually refers to compactness as a measure to merely determine how much members of a group are similar among each other, we argue that the mutual trustworthiness between the members should be considered as an important factor in defining such a term. In fact, trust has profound effects on the dynamics of group formation and their evolution: individuals are more likely to join with and stay in a group if they can trust other group members. In this paper, we propose a quantitative measure of group compactness that takes into account both the similarity and the trustworthiness among users, and we present an algorithm to optimize such a measure. We provide empirical results, obtained from the real social networks EPINIONS and CIAO, that compare our notion of compactness versus the traditional notion of user similarity, clearly proving the advantages of our approach.

The time-varying unknown phase delay that arises due to both software (filtering) and hardware (sensors) in these robotics instruments adversely affects the device performance. In this paper, moving window-based least squares support vector machines approach is formulated for multistep prediction of tremor to overcome the time-varying delay. This approach relies on the kernel-learning technique and does not require the knowledge of prediction horizon compared to the existing methods that require the delay to be known as a priori. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations and experiments with the tremor data recorded from surgeons and novice subjects. Comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques highlights the suitability and better performance of the proposed method.

Several predictive monitoring techniques have been proposed in the past. However, so far those prediction techniques have been assessed only independently from each other, making it hard to reliably compare their applicability and accuracy. We empirically analyze and compare three main classes of predictive monitoring techniques, which are based on machine learning, constraint satisfaction, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) aggregation. Based on empirical evidence from an industrial case study in the area of transport and logistics, we assess those techniques with respect to five accuracy indicators. We further determine the dependency of accuracy on the point in time during process execution when a prediction is made in order to determine lead-times for accurate predictions. Our evidence suggests that, given a lead-time of half of the process duration, all predictive monitoring techniques consistently provide an accuracy of at least 70%. Yet, it also becomes evident that the techniques differ in terms of how accurately they may predict violations and nonviolations. To improve the prediction process, we thus exploit the characteristics of the individual techniques and propose their combination. Based on our case study data, evidence indicates that certain combinations of techniques may outperform individual techniques with respect to specific accuracy indicators. Combining constraint satisfaction with QoS aggregation, for instance, improves precision by 14%; combining machine learning with constraint satisfaction shows an improvement in recall by 23%.

J	Alazab, M				Alazab, Mamoun			Profiling and classifying the behavior of malicious codes	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Cybercrime; Malware; Profiling	MALWARE DETECTION; EXECUTABLES	Malware is a major security threat confronting computer systems and networks and has increased in scale and impact from the early days of ICE Traditional protection mechanisms are largely incapable of dealing with the diversity and volume of malware variants which is evident today. This paper examines the evolution of malware including the nature of its activity and variants, and the implication of this for computer security industry practices. As a first step to address this challenge, I propose a framework to extract features statically and dynamically from malware that reflect the behavior of its code such as the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls. Similarity based mining and machine learning methods have been employed to profile and classify malware behaviors. This method is based on the sequences of API sequence calls and frequency of appearance. Experimental analysis results using large datasets show that the proposed method is effective in identifying known malware variants, and also classifies malware with high accuracy and low false alarm rates. This encouraging result indicates that classification is a viable approach for similarity detection to help detect malware. This work advances the detection of zero-day malware and offers researchers another method for understanding impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Medium-Term Urban Water Demand Forecasting with Limited Data Using an Ensemble Wavelet-Bootstrap Machine-Learning Approach	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Resampling; Ensemble; Water demand; Forecasting; Wavelets; Canada	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT; STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; MODEL; REGRESSION; RUNOFF; SERIES	Accurate and reliable weekly and monthly water demand forecasting is important for effective and sustainable planning and use of urban water supply infrastructure. This study explored a hybrid wavelet-bootstrap-artificial neural network (WBANN) modeling approach for weekly (one-week) and monthly (one- and two-month) urban water demand forecasting in situations with limited data availability. The performance of WBANN models was also compared with that of standard artificial neural networks (ANN), bootstrap-based ANN (BANN), and wavelet-based ANN (WANN) models. The proposed WBANN method is aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of water demand forecasting by incorporating the capability of wavelet transformation and bootstrap analysis using artificial neural networks. Daily and monthly maximum temperature, total precipitation, and water demand data for almost three years obtained from the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada were used in this study. For weekly and monthly lead-time forecasting, the hybrid WBANN and WANN models were determined to be more accurate compared with the ANN and BANN methods. The WANN and WBANN models simulated peak water demand very effectively. The better performance of the WANN and WBANN models for weekly and monthly water demand forecasts indicated that wavelet analysis significantly improved the model's performance, whereas the bootstrap technique improved the reliability of water demand forecasts by producing ensemble forecasts. WBANN models were also found to be effective in assessing the uncertainty associated with water demand forecasts in terms of confidence bands, which is helpful in operational water demand forecasting. This study was conducted with a very short length of available data, indicating the effectiveness of WANN and WBANN modeling approaches in situations with limited data availability.

Prospective research is needed to identify the biomarkers predicting nonremission prior to treatment initiation. We collected blood samples from a discovery cohort of 34 adult MDD patients with co-occurring anxiety and 33 matched, nondepressed controls at baseline and after 12 weeks (of citalopram plus psychotherapy treatment for the depressed cohort). Samples were processed on gene arrays and group differences in gene expression were investigated. Exploratory analyses suggest that at pretreatment baseline, nonremitting patients differ from controls with gene function and transcription factor analyses potentially related to elevated inflammation and immune activation. In a second phase, we applied an unbiased machine learning prediction model and corrected for model-selection bias. Results show that baseline gene expression predicted nonremission with 79.4% corrected accuracy with a 13-gene model. The same gene-only model predicted nonremission after 8 weeks of citalopram treatment with 76% corrected accuracy in an independent validation cohort of 63 MDD patients treated with citalopram at another institution. Together, these results demonstrate the potential, but also the limitations, of baseline peripheral blood-based gene expression to predict nonremission after citalopram treatment These results not only support their use in future prediction tools but also suggest that increased accuracy may be obtained with the inclusion of additional predictors (eg, genetics and clinical scales).
