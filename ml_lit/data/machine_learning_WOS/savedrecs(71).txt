In subpopulation assessment, we are interested in making predictions not for a single patient, but for groups of patients. Typically, in any large population, different subpopulations will have different "outcome" rates. In our example, the C-section rate of a population of 22,176 expectant mothers is 16.8%; yet, the 17 physician groups that serve this population have vastly different group C-section rates, ranging from 11% to 23%. The ultimate goal of subpopulation assessment is to determine if these variations in the observed rates can be attributed to (a) variations in intrinsic risk of the patient sub-populations (i.e. some groups contain more "high-risk C-section" patients), or (b) differences in physician practice (i.e. some groups do more C-sections). Our results indicate that although there is some variation in intrinsic risk, there is also much variation in physician practice.

For eukaryotic organisms a large part of locating the genes is accomplished by predicting the likely location of splice sites on a DNA strand This problem of splice site location has been approached using a number of machine learning or statistical methods tailored more or less specifically to the nature of the problem. Recently large margin classifiers and boosting methods have been found to give improvements over more traditional methods in a number of areas. Here we compare large margin classifiers (SVM and CMLS) and boosted decision trees with the three most common models used for splice site detection (WMM, WAM, and MDT). We find that the newer methods compare favorably in all cases and can yield significant improvement in some cases.

We trained 3 inductive learning algorithms (MC4, IB, and Naive-Bayes) on 60 simulated datasets of parsed radiology text reports labeled with 6 disease states. Data sets were constructed to define positive outcome states at 4 prevalence rates (1, 5, 10, 25, and 50%) in training set sizes of 200 and 2,000 cases. We found that the effect of outcome prevalence is significant when outcome classes drop below 10% of cases. The effect appeared independent of sample size, induction algorithm used, or class label. Work is needed to identify methods of improving classifier performance when output classes are rare.

The categories refer to the patient's status with respect to the medication such as discontinuation, start or initiation, and continuation of a given medication. This categorization is performed with a machine learning technique, Maximum Entropy (ME), that is well suited to incorporating heterogeneous sources of information necessary for classifying patient's medication status. We use hand labeled training data to generate ME models and test 5 different training feature sets. Our results show that the most optimal feature set includes a combination of the following: two words preceding and following the mention of the drug, the subject,of the sentence in which the drug mention occurs, the 2 words following the subject, and a binary feature vector of lexicalized semantic cues indicative of medication status or its change. The average predictive power of a model trained on these features is similar to89%.

Simpler and more widely accepted statistical tools have not yet been used for this purpose, hence proper comparisons between classification methods have not been conducted We developed free software that implements logistic regression with stepwise variable selection as a quick and simple method for initial exploration of important genetic markers in disease classification. To implement the algorithm and allow our collaborators in remote locations to evaluate and compare its results against those of other methods, we developed a user-friendly asynchronous web-based application with a minimal amount of programming using free, downloadable software tools. With this program, we show that classification using logistic regression can perform as well as other more sophisticated algorithms, and it has the advantages of being easy to interpret and reproduce. By making the tool freely and easily available, we hope to promote the comparison of classification methods. In addition, we believe our web application can be used as a model for other bioinformatics laboratories that need to develop web-based analysis tools in a short amount of time and on a limited budget.

The approach is based on terms and one of the difficulties is extracting a feature set appropriate for the domain. This paper addresses the medical news-filtering problem using a machine learning approach. We describe the application of two supervised machine learning techniques, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes, to automatically construct classifiers on the basis of a training set, in which news articles have been pre-classified by a medical expert and four other human readers. The goal is to classify the news articles into three groups: non-medical, medical intended for experts, and medical intended for other readers. While the general accuracy of the machine learning approach is around 78%, the accuracy of distinguishing non-medical articles from medical ones is shown to be 92%.

MAS can do decisions automatically without intervention of human operators or they can assist the human operators to mastering automation systems. In principle agents can learn what is called machine learning; but it is emphasized that it could be done co-operatively with the human operators of automation systems.

In this research an automatic monitoring system, which can recognize the vocalizations of four species of frogs and can identify different individuals within the species of interest, is proposed. For the desired monitoring system, species identification is performed first with the proposed filtering and grouping algorithm. Individual identification, which can estimate frog population within the specific species, is performed in the second stage. Digital signal pre-processing, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and neural network pattern classification are performed step by step in this stage. Wavelet Packet feature extraction together with two different dimension reduction algorithms are synergistically integrated to produce final feature vectors, which are to be fed into a neural network classifier. The simulation results show the promising future of deploying an array of continuous, on-line environmental monitoring systems based upon nonintrusive analysis of animal calls.

It is no longer practical to analyze such a large dataset by hand, while the development of handwritten feature extraction tools is expensive and laborious. This project investigates the application of machine learning techniques to problems of feature extraction and digital image processing within the Mars dataset. The Los Alamos GENIE machine learning software system uses a genetic algorithm to assemble feature extraction tools from low-level image operators. Each generated tool is evaluated against training data provided by the user. The best tools in each generation are allowed to "reproduce" to produce the next generation, and the population of tools evolves until it converges to a solution or reaches a level of performance specified by the user. Craters are one of the most scientifically interesting and most numerous features on Mars, and present a wide range of shapes at many spatial scales. We now describe results on development of crater finder algorithms using voting sets of simple classifiers evolved by a machine learning/genetic programming system (the Los Alamos GENIE software).

When dealing with a remote sensing inverse problem, the PAR, overfitting prevents GP evolved models to be successfully applied to real data. We propose to use a classic method of overfitting control by the way of a validation set. This allows to go backward in the, evolution process in order to retrieve previous, not yet overfitted models. Although this "backwarding" method performs well on academic benchmarks, there is not enough improvement to deal with the PAR. A new backwarding criterion is then-derived using real satellite data and the knowledge of plausible physical bounds for the PAR coefficient in the geographical area that is monitored. This, leads,to satisfactory GP models and drastically improved images.

After an analysis of a large collection of puzzles, we decided to use an open architecture in which independent programs specialize in solving specific types of clues, drawing on ideas from information retrieval, database search, and machine learning. Each expert module generates a (possibly empty) candidate list for each clue, and the lists are merged together and placed into the grid by a centralized solver. We used a probabilistic representation as a common interchange language between subsystems and to drive the search for an optimal solution. PROVERB, the complete system, averages 95.3% words correct and 98.1% letters correct in under 15 minutes per puzzle on a sample of 370 puzzles taken from the New York Times and several other puzzle sources. This corresponds to missing roughly 3 words or 4 letters on a daily 15 x 15 puzzle, making PROVERB a better-than-average cruciverbalist (crossword solver). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Tesauro, G				Tesauro, G			Programming backgammon using self-teaching neural nets	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						reinforcement learning; temporal difference learning; neural networks; backgammon; games; doubling strategy; rollouts	NETWORKS	TD-Gammon is a neural network that is able to teach itself to play backgammon solely by playing against itself and learning from the results. Starting from random initial play, TD-Gammon's self-teaching methodology results in a surprisingly strong program: without lookahead, its positional judgement rivals that of human experts, and when combined with shallow lookahead, it reaches a level of play that surpasses even the best human players. The success of TD-Gammon has also been replicated by several other programmers; at least two other neural net programs also appear to be capable of superhuman play. Previous papers on TD-Gammon have focused on developing a scientific understanding of its reinforcement learning methodology. This paper views machine learning as a tool in a programmer's toolkit, and considers how it can be combined with other programming techniques to achieve and surpass world-class backgammon play. Particular emphasis is placed on programming shallow-depth search algorithms, and on TD-Gammon's doubling algorithm, which is described in print here for the first time.

The outcome to be predicted is a measure of the clotting time for the patient; this measure is continuous and so the prediction task is a regression problem. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful mechanism for learning to predict such outcomes from training data. However, experiments have shown that an ANN is biased towards values more commonly occurring in the training data and is thus, less likely to be correct in predicting extreme values. This issue of bias in training data in regression problems is similar to the associated problem with minority classes in classification. However, this bias issue in classification is well documented and is an on-going area of research. In this paper, we consider stratified sampling and boosting as solutions to this bias problem and evaluate them on this outcome prediction problem and on two other datasets. Both approaches produce some improvements with boosting showing the most promise. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This formalism may be used to diagnose breakdown situations in telecommunication networks. The main task is to discover significant temporal patterns in the large databases generated by the monitoring system. In this kind of applications, time duration is relevant to the alarms identification process. The shapes of the decision boundaries are usually axis-parallel with constraints. The representation of examples in our formalism is similar to the representation described in the Nested Generalized Exemplar theory [Sal91]. This theory of generalization produces an excellent generalization with interpretable hypotheses [WD95] in domains where the decision boundaries are axis-parallel. Using Allen qualitative relations between intervals, firstly we will give an adapted organization of the set of relations, then we will define an operator of generalization and we will give a table of qualitative generalization. Finally we suggest two learning algorithms. The second one uses a topologic lattice between relations to optimize the first one.

The efficiency of optimization directly depends on the compiler heuristics. These heuristics must be target-specific and each new processor generation requires heuristics reengineering. In this paper, we address the automatic generation of optimization heuristics for a target processor by machine learning. We evaluate the potential of this method on an always legal and simple transformation: loop unrolling. Though simple to implement, this transformation may have strong effects on program execution (good or bad). However deciding to perform the transformation or not is difficult since many interacting parameters must be taken into account. So we propose a machine learning approach.

Does the Machine Learning Based Heuristics achieve better performance than existing ones?.	Univ Rennes, IRISA, Rennes, France	Monsifrot, A (reprint author), Univ Rennes, IRISA, Rennes, France.

The machine learning algorithms synthesize various knowledge representation forms, most of them equivalent and inter-changeable. A new approach is needed to support and combine the knowledge representation form with various data sources (represented by database management systems). In this paper, a powerful, visual CASE tool for knowledge management is introduced. It supports the integration of high-level knowledge "beans" into host projects. A scalable approach to the problem of data integration from conventional database systems in expert systems is also over-viewed.

We refer to such circuits as parallel perceptrons. In spite of their simplicity, these circuits are universal approximators for arbitrary boolean and continuous functions. In contrast to backprop for multi-layer perceptrons, our new learning algorithm - the parallel delta rule (p-delta rule) - only has to tune a single layer of weights, and it does not require the computation and communication of analog values with high precision. Reduced communication also distinguishes our new learning rule from other learning rules for such circuits such as those traditionally used for MADALINE. A theoretical analysis shows that the p-delta rule does in fact implement gradient descent with regard to a suitable error measure - although it does not require to compute derivatives. Furthermore it is shown through experiments on common real-world benchmark datasets that its performance is competitive with that of other learning approaches from neural networks and machine learning. Thus our algorithm also provides an interesting new hypothesis for the organization of learning in biological neural systems.

We explain how semidefinite programming can be used to perform an approximate weighted completion of the kernel matrix that ensures positive semidefiniteness and hence Mercer's condition. In numerical experiments we apply a support vector machine to the XOR classification task based on randomly sparsified kernel matrices from a polynomial kernel of degree 2. The approximate completion algorithm leads to better generalisation and to fewer support vectors as compared to a simple spectral truncation method at the cost of considerably longer runtime. We argue that semidefinite programming provides an interesting convex optimisation framework for machine learning in general and for kernel-machines in particular.

We applied supervised machine learning to the problem of using phenotype data to predict the functional class of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in Saccaromyces cerevisiae. Three sources of data were used: TRansposon-Insertion Phenotypes, Localization and Expression in Saccharomyces (TRIPLES), European Functional Analysis Network (EUROFAN) and Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS). The analysis of the data presented a number of challenges to machine learning: multi-class labels, a large number of sparsely populated classes, the need to learn a set of accurate rules (not a complete classification), and a very large amount of missing values. We modified the algorithm C4.5 to deal with these problems. Results: Rules were learnt which are accurate and biologically meaningful. The rules predict function of 83 ORFs of unknown function at an estimated accuracy of greater than or equal to80%.

J	Donnes, P; Elofsson, A				Donnes, P; Elofsson, A			Prediction of MHC class I binding peptides, using SVMHC	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						MHC class I; peptide prediction; machine learning; support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; MOLECULES; DATABASE; EXPRESSION; PROTEINS; MOTIFS	Background: T-cells are key players in regulating a specific immune response. Activation of cytotoxic T-cells requires recognition of specific peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules. MHC-peptide complexes are potential tools for diagnosis and treatment of pathogens and cancer, as well as for the development of peptide vaccines. Only one in 100 to 200 potential binders actually binds to a certain MHC molecule, therefore a good prediction method for MHC class I binding peptides can reduce the number of candidate binders that need to be synthesized and tested. Results: Here, we present a novel approach, SVMHC, based on support vector machines to predict the binding of peptides to MHC class I molecules. This method seems to perform slightly better than two profile based methods, SYFPEITHI and HLA_BIND. The implementation of SVMHC is quite simple and does not involve any manual steps, therefore as more data become available it is trivial to provide prediction for more MHC types. SVMHC currently contains prediction for 26 MHC class I types from the MHCPEP database or alternatively 6 MHC class I types from the higher quality SYFPEITHI database. The prediction models for these MHC types are implemented in a public web service available at [http://www.sbc.su.se/svmhc/]. Conclusions: Prediction of MHC class I binding peptides using Support Vector Machines, shows high performance and is easy to apply to a large number of MHC class I types. As more peptide data are put into MHC databases, SVMHC can easily be updated to give prediction for additional MHC class I types.

J	Karwath, A; King, RD				Karwath, A; King, RD			Homology induction: the use of machine learning to improve sequence similarity searches	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; PROTEIN-SEQUENCE; PROFILE ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CLASS; REMOTE HOMOLOGS; IDENTIFICATION; ALIGNMENT; DATABASE; ACCURATE	Background: The inference of homology between proteins is a key problem in molecular biology The current best approaches only identify similar to50% of homologies (with a false positive rate set at I/ 1000). Results: We present Homology Induction (HI), a new approach to inferring homology. HI uses machine learning to bootstrap from standard sequence similarity search methods. First a standard method is run, then HI learns rules which are true for sequences of high similarity to the target (assumed homologues) and not true for general sequences, these rules are then used to discriminate sequences in the twilight zone. To learn the rules HI describes the sequences in a novel way based on a bioinformatic knowledge base, and the machine learning method of inductive logic programming. To evaluate HI we used the PDB40D benchmark which lists sequences of known homology but low sequence similarity. We compared the H I methodoly with PSI-BLAST alone and found HI performed significantly better. In addition, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that these improvements were robust for all reasonable error costs. The predictive homology rules learnt by HI by can be interpreted biologically to provide insight into conserved features of homologous protein families. Conclusions: HI is a new technique for the detection of remote protein homolgy - a central bioinformatic problem. HI with PSI-BLAST is shown to outperform PSI-BLAST for all error costs. It is expect that similar improvements would be obtained using HI with any sequence similarity method.

The first, an Evolutionary Programming (EP) / Adaptive Boosting (AB) based hybrid, intelligently combines the outputs from an iteratively "called" weak learning algorithm (one which performs at least slightly better than random guessing) in order to "boost" the performance of an EP-derived weak learner. The second paradigm is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). SVMs are new and radically different types of classifiers and learning machines that use a hypothesis space of linear functions in a high dimensional feature space. The most important advantage of a SVM, unlike neural networks, is that SVM training always finds a global minimum. Furthermore, the SVM has inherent ability to solve pattern classification without incorporating any problem-domain knowledge. In this study, the both the EP/AB hybrid and SVM were employed as pattern classifiers, operating on mammography data used for breast cancer detection. The main focus of the study was to construct and seek the best EP/AB hybrid and SVM configurations for optimum specificity and positive predictive value at very high sensitivities. Using a mammogram database of 500 biopsy-proven samples, the best performing SVM, on average, was able to achieve (under statistical 5-fold cross-validation) a specificity of 45.0% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 50.1% at 100% sensitivity. At 97% sensitivity, a specificity of 55.8% and a PPV of 55.2% were obtained. The best performing EP/AB hybrid obtained slightly lower, but comparable, results.

Recently, developing checkers player using evolutionary algorithms has been widely exploited to show the power of evolution for machine learning. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary checkers player that is developed by a speciation technique called crowding algorithm. In many experiments, our checkers player with ensemble structure shows better performance than non-speciated checkers players.

When the data set is large, however, the DTs obtained may become very large, and they are no longer comprehensible. To increase the comprehensibility of DTs, we have proposed several methods. For example, we have tried to evolve DTs using genetic programming (GP), with tree size as the secondary fitness measure; we have tried to initialize GP using results obtained by C4.5; and we have also tried to introduce the divide-and-conquer concept in GP, but all results obtained are still not good enough. Up to now we have tried to design good DTs from given fixed data. In this paper,we look at the problem from a different point of view. The basic idea is to evolve a small data set that can cover the domain knowledge as good as possible. From this data set, a small but good DT can be designed. The validity of the new algorithm is verified through several experiments.

J	Roy, DK; Pentland, AP				Roy, DK; Pentland, AP			Learning words from sights and sounds: a computational model	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						language acquisition; cross-modal; sensor grounded; learning; computational model	INFANTS; SPEECH; SEGMENTATION; PERCEPTION; PATTERNS; BIAS	This paper presents an implemented computational model of word acquisition which learns directly from raw multimodal sensory input. Set in an information theoretic framework, the model acquires a lexicon by finding and statistically modeling consistent cross-modal structure. The model has been implemented in a system using novel speech processing, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms. In evaluations the model successfully performed speech segmentation, word discovery and visual categorization from spontaneous infant-directed speech paired with video images of single objects. These results demonstrate the possibility of using state-of-the-art techniques from sensory pattern recognition and machine learning to implement cognitive models which can process raw sensor data without the need for human transcription or labeling.

The Framework uses a proprietary machine-learning algorithm to construct predictive models from existing experimental data. These predictive models are used to computationally screen the contents of large virtual libraries. A variety of experimental design techniques can be brought to bear on the results of a virtual library screen in order to suggest an optimal set of synthesis candidates for the next round of experimentation. We have demonstrated the power and generality of the Rational Discovery Framework in a series of proofs of concept. Here we present an overview of the Framework as well as the results of studies aimed at developing predictive models for materials properties: ferromagnetism in ordered and disordered transition-metal alloys; and prediction of T(c) values for superconductors.

This paper reports on an Army-sponsored study conducted to research the applicability of data mining for processing such data. The study focused on three aspects: (1) understanding the aviation operations, maintenance environment, and data collection system; (2) investigating data analysis approaches with the purpose of identifying promising methods pertinent to aircraft health management; and (3) defining requirements for a tool to support the aviation maintenance planners and fleet managers. Results of preliminary analyses of two maintenance data and flight data sets are presented. An architecture for managing and mining aviation maintenance data and using results to update models used by diagnostic modules for fault isolation during maintenance activity is also presented.

The algorithm works by finding the best performing quantization complexity of the feature vectors, and this makes it necessary to discretize all continuous valued features. Therefore, results are given by showing the quantization of the continuous valued features that yields best performance. Further, the Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm is also compared to a conventional linear classifier, which does not discretize any feature values. In general, the Bayesian Data reduction Algorithm is shown to outperform the linear classifier by obtaining a lower probability of error, as averaged over all data sets.

Irrespective of the way the transformation of knowledge, the developed methods usuallyfall into two classes: methods with high rate of transformed knowledge is done, but with a lot of restrictions concerning the type of data in the training sets, training methods, and the size of data sets; and methods with moderate rate of transformed knowledge, but with less restrictions. Our main interest was to find or develop a technique that would possess the knowledge acquisition power of neural networks and explanation power of decision trees. That is why we developed a NN-DT Cascade method, which is capable of transforming a part of knowledge from the neural network into a decision tree.

The basic idea is to indicate uncertain words in the transcriptions and replace them with phoneme recognition results that are post-processed using a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) converter. We concentrate on the final step, P2G conversion: we show that the phoneme recognition results can be reasonably reliably transcribed orthographically using machine learning techniques. More specifically, (i) we present experimental results of a machine learning approach to PIG conversion, and compare these results with an estimation of the upper and lower baseline performance, (ii) we give an error analysis and list some examples of the converter's output, (iii) we investigate spelling correction as post-processing of the orthographic transcriptions, and (iv) we report on the interaction of the P2G converter with a speech recognizer.

We used gazetteers and a corpus to construct training material for Ripper, a rule learner. Instead of using Ripper to train a complete system, we used many different runs of Ripper in order to derive rules which we then interpreted and implemented in our own, hand-crafted system. This speeded up the building of a hand-crafted system, and allowed us to use many different rule sets in order to improve performance. We discuss the advantages of using machine learning software as a toot in knowledge acquisition, and evaluate the resulting system for Dutch.

The learning task consists of the identification of communication problems arising in either the previous turn or the current turn of the dialogue. Previous experiments with our corpus have shown that combining dialogue history and word-graph features is beneficial for detecting errors (in particular in the previous turn). Other researchers have reported that combining prosodic and ASR characteristics is helpful (primarily in the current turn). In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of large-scale combinations of these features for the above two tasks. We show that we are unable to reproduce the benefits of prosodic features for learning problematic situations, even though the overall prosodic trends in our corpus are similar to those earlier reported on. Moreover, the best results are obtained using just minimal combinations of two sources of information.

S	Flach, P; Lavrac, N		Kakas, AC; Sadri, F		Flach, P; Lavrac, N			Learning in clausal logic: A perspective on inductive logic programming	COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC: LOGIC PROGRAMMING AND BEYOND, PT I: ESSAYS IN HONOUR OF ROBERT A KOWALSKI	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Article							DISCOVERY; PREDICTION	Inductive logic programming is a form of machine learning from examples which employs the representation formalism of clausal logic. One of the earliest inductive logic programming systems was Ehud Shapiro's Model Inference System [90], which could synthesise simple recursive programs like append/3. Many of the techniques devised by Shapiro, such as top-down search of program clauses by refinement operators, the use of intensional background knowledge, and the capability of inducing recursive clauses, are still in use today. On the other hand, significant advances have been made regarding dealing with noisy data, efficient heuristic and stochastic search methods, the use of logical representations going beyond definite clauses, and restricting the search space by means of declarative bias. The latter is a general term denoting any form of restrictions on the syntactic form of possible hypotheses. These include the use of types, input/output mode declarations, and clause schemata. Recently, some researchers have started using alternatives to Prolog featuring strong typing and real functions, which alleviate the need for some of the above ad-hoc mechanisms. Others have gone beyond Prolog by investigating learning tasks in which the hypotheses are not definite clause programs, but for instance sets of indefinite clauses or denials, constraint logic programs, or clauses representing association rules. The chapter gives an accessible introduction to the above topics. In addition, it outlines the main current research directions which have been strongly influenced by recent developments in data mining and challenging real-life applications.

It is argued that the flexibility and expressivity of logical representations are particularly useful in more complex natural language learning tasks. A number of inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques for natural language are analysed including the CHILL system, abduction and the incorporation of linguistic knowledge, including active learning. Hybrid approaches integrating ILP with manual development environments and probabilistic techniques are advocated.

The optimal price is determined by maximizing expected profit, given the underlying seller costs of the bid items and a computed probability of winning the bid as a function of price and other bid features such as buyer characteristics and the degree of competition. An entropy-based information-gain metric is used to quantify the contribution of the extracted features to predicting the win/loss label. A naive Bayes classification model is developed to predict the bid outcome (win or loss) as a function of these features. This model naturally generates the win probability as a function of bid price required to compute the optimal price. Results obtained by applying this model to a database of bid transactions involving computer sales demonstrate statistically significant lift curves for predicting bid outcome. A method for creating additional synthetic bids to improve computation of the win probability function is demonstrated. Finally, the computed optimal prices generated via this approach are compared to the actual bid prices approved by human pricing experts.

Once a solution is found, the construction of the tree goes on in order to obtain more solutions ordered as well by description length. The result is a multi-tree which is populated taking into consideration computational resources according to a Levin search. Some experiments show that the method pays off in practice.

Explorative research using a simple voting system is presented and discussed in the light of a probabilistic model that was originally developed for safety critical software. It was found that typical categorization approaches produce predictions which are too similar for combining them to be effective since they tend to fail on the same records. Further experiments using two less orthodox categorizers are also presented which suggest that combining text categorizers can be successful, provided the essential element of 'difference' is considered.

Unfortunately the solution requires the inversion of a p x p matrix, where p is the number of points in the data set, thus making it impractical for large scale applications. As it turns out, a surprisingly good approximate solution is often possible using only a small subset of corresponding points. We begin by discussing the obvious approach of using the subsampled set to estimate a transformation that is then applied to all the points, and we show the drawbacks of this method. We then proceed to borrow a technique from the machine learning community for function approximation using radial basis functions (RBFs) and adapt it to the task at hand. Using this method, we demonstrate a significant improvement over the naive method. One drawback of this method, however, is that is does not allow for principal warp analysis, a technique for studying shape deformations introduced by Bookstein based on the eigenvectors of the p x p bending energy matrix. To address this, we described a, third approximation method based on a classic matrix completion technique that allows for principal warp analysis as a by-product.. By means of experiments on real and synthetic data, we demonstrated the pros and cons of these different approximations so as to allow the reader to make an informed decision suited to his or her application.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used as non-linear discrimination tools. However, before building the models, selection of the best subset of variables is carried out with Genetic Algorithms (GA). The best subset of descriptors selected - by the GA was constituted by five variables from the originally 75 collected. The data was split into 4 training set (483 patients; 22 cases with UA) - and a validation set (243 patients; 12 of cases with UA). The criterion used to select the best model was based on the sensitivity (SE); specificity (SP) and negative predictive values (NPV) in the validation data set. The final SVM model (RBF kernel) yielded good results (SE = 66.67%, SP = 79.77% in the validation set). The recognition rate was 79.12% and a high rate of NPV (97.87%) was obtained. Methods proposed have proven to be well-suited for this problem, simplifying the solution and providing excellent discrimination scores.

At the first stage, a data-mining-based approach is used to identify crucial medical-oriented features that can distinguish PAF HRV sequences from non-PAF HRV ones. However, PAF patients can experience PAF without exhibiting the medical-oriented features. To detect this type of patients, at the second stage, we employ a machine-learning-based approach to select certain nonlinear features that can classify HRV sequences into classes of PAF or non-PAF. The developed approach was trained on the PAF Prediction Challenge Database and was tested on the dataset consisting of 30-minute HRV episodes extracted from MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database and the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. It was obtained from the numerical evaluation that the developed approach achieved about 85% of accuracy in short-term prognosis of PAF by using the first stage approach alone and around 90% of accuracy with the combination of both stages. Furthermore, the developed medical-oriented features can be clinically valuable to the cardiologists for providing insights to the initiation of PAR.

Its main contribution, however, is to show that an existing relation between two reference systems - the speaker-relative and the absolute - can be automatically learned by an ILP system, given the proper background knowledge and positive examples.

It allows to avoid re-learning of all the parameters by selecting a working subset where the incremental learning is performed. While this procedure can be applied to various schemes (hybrid decision trees, committee machines), we illustrate it with Support Vector Machines based on local kernel. We derive and compare three methods to perform the selection procedure: two of them take advantage of the estimation of generalization error by using theoretical error bounds devoted to SVM. Experimental simulations on three typical datasets of machine learning give promising results.

Collaborative filtering uses a database about user preferences to predict additional topics. Content based systems provide recommendations by matching user interests with topic attributes. In this paper, we describe a method for discovery of user preference by using hybrid two techniques for recommendation that allow the application of machine learning algorithm. The method generates recommendations based on clustering user and categorizing items with feature selection through association word mining by Apriori algorithm. We use Genetic algorithm to group users based on items categorized by Naive Bayes classifier. Then, we recommend web documents to user based on grouped user preference and information of categorized items. We evaluate our method on a large database of user ratings for web document and it significantly outperforms previous proposed methods.

In this paper we focus on coarse grained maps that describe the spatial neighborhood relation between secondary structure elements (helices, strands, and coils) of a protein. We introduce a new machine learning approach for scoring candidate contact maps. The method combines a specialized noncausal recursive connectionist architecture and a heuristic graph search algorithm. The network is trained using candidate graphs generated during search. We show how the process of selecting and generating training examples is important for tuning the precision of the predictor.

However, scalability, accuracy and efficiency are significant concerns regarding how to effectively deal with large and complex data sets in the implementation. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning approach (we call our approach GAIT), combining genetic algorithm, statistical sampling, and decision tree, to develop intelligent decision trees that can alleviate some of these problems. We design our computational experiments and run GAIT on three different data sets (namely Socio-Olympic data, Westinghouse data, and FAA data) to test its performance against standard decision tree algorithm, neural network classifier, and statistical discriminant technique, respectively. The computational results show that our approach outperforms standard decision tree algorithm profoundly at lower sampling levels, and achieves significantly better results with less effort than both neural network and discriminant classifiers.

They are widely used in many domains, where information about species, products, customers, publications, etc. needs to be organized. In the absence of standards, many taxonomies of the same entities can co-exist. A problem arises when data categorized in a particular taxonomy needs to be used by a procedure (methodology or algorithm) that uses a different taxonomy. Usually, a labor-intensive manual approach is used to solve this problem. This paper describes a machine learning approach which aids domain experts in changing taxonomies. It allows learning relationships between two taxonomies and mapping the data from one taxonomy into another. The proposed approach uses decision trees and bootstrapping for learning mappings of instances from the source to the target taxonomies. A C4.5 decision tree classifier is trained on a small manually labeled training set and applied to a randomly selected sample from the unlabeled data. The classification results are analyzed and the misclassified items are corrected and all items are added to the training set. This procedure is iterated until unlabeled data is available or an acceptable error rate is reached. In the latter case the last classifier is used to label all the remaining data. We test our approach on a database of products obtained from as grocery store chain and find that it performs well, reaching 92.6% accuracy while requiring the human expert to explicitly label only 18% of the entire data.

It has been applied in such fields as machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analyzing and control algorithm acquiring successfully. Many researchers have studied rough sets in different view. In this paper, the authors discuss the reduction of knowledge using information entropy in rough set theory. First, the changing tendency of the conditional entropy of decision attributes given condition attributes is studied from the viewpoint of information. Then, two new algorithms based on conditional entropy are developed. These two algorithms are analyzed and compared with MIBARK algorithm. Furthermore, our simulation results show that the algorithms can find the minimal reduction in most cases.

On the other hand, soft computing deals with information processing. If these two key properties can be combined in a constructive way, then this formation can effectively be used for knowledge discovery in large databases. Referring to this synergetic combination, the basic merits of data mining and soft computing paradigms are pointed out and novel data mining implementation coupled to a soft computing approach for knowledge discovery is presented. Knowledge modeling by machine learning together with the computer experiments is described and. the effectiveness of the machine learning approach employed is demonstrated.

Advances in data storage technology have allowed the transformation of an enormous amount of data into computerized database systems. Nowadays, there are many efforts to convert the large amounts of data into useful patterns or trends. Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) is a process that combines Data Mining (DM) techniques from machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to automatically extract concepts, interrelationships, and patterns of interest from a large database. By applying KDD and DM to the analysis of construction project data, this paper presents the results of a research that discovers the knowledge through KDD process to better identify recurring construction problems.

Because foregone profits of defected customers are significant, an increase of the retention rate can be very profitable. In this paper, we focus on the treatment of companies' most promising current customers in a non-contractual setting. We build a model in order to predict chum behavior of top clients who will (partially) defect in the near future. We applied the following classification techniques: logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, C4.5, neural networks and Naive Bayes. Their performance is quantified by the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The experiments were carried out on a real life data set obtained by a Belgian retailer. The article contributes in many ways. The results show that past customer behavior has predictive power to indicate future partial defection. This finding is from a companies' point of view even more important than being able to define total defectors, which was until now the traditional goal in attrition research. It was found that neural networks performed better than the other classification techniques in terms of both classification accuracy and AUROC. Although the performance benefits are sometimes small in absolute terms, they are statistically significant and relevant from a marketing perspective. Finally it was found that the number of past shop visits and the time between past shop incidences are amongst the most predictive inputs for the problem at hand.

One of the aspects that have influence on the K2 performance is the initial order of the attributes in the data set, however, in most cases, this algorithm is applied without giving special attention to this preorder, The present work performs an empirical method to select an appropriate attribute order, before applying the learning algorithm (K2). Afterwards, it does the data preparation and classification tasks. In order to analyze the results, in a first step, the data classification. is done without considering the initial order of the attributes. Thereafter it seeks for a good variable order, and having the sequence of the attributes, the classification is performed again. Once these results are obtained, the same algorithm is used to substitute missing values in the learning dataset in order to verify how the process works in this kind of task. The dataset used came from the standard classification problems databases from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results are empirically compared taking into consideration the mean and standard deviation.

Regression trees are presented as a useful simulation/modelling tool for making predictions on WWTP operation given measured data at the input. A crucial step in the construction of such models is data preparation. Two data sets measured on two different WWTP are used in this paper. Both databases are composed of data that are usually measured on a WWTP and characterise the WWTP operation. The main difference between them is in data presentation. In the first data set (WWTP1) data are presented as a one-day situation of the plant operation, i.e. daily averaged values of the measured data (attributes) are given. Second data set (WWTP2) is composed of actual values of the attributes measured in one hour intervals. Regression tree models that predict outflow attributes according to inflow attributes are constructed for both data sets and compared in their performance. Assumption that data presentation and further preparation have a big influence on the results was confirmed. Program package WEKA, which includes most of popular machine learning algorithms, was used for constructing the models.

It has been shown that combining different branch predictors can yield more accurate prediction schemes, but the existing research only examines selection-based approaches where one predictor is chosen without considering the actual predictions of the available predictors. The machine learning literature contains many papers addressing the problem of predicting a binary sequence in the presence of an ensemble of predictors or experts. We show that the Weighted Majority algorithm applied to an ensemble of branch predictors yields a prediction scheme that results in a 5-11% reduction in mispredictions. We also demonstrate that a variant of the Weighted Majority algorithm that is simplified for efficient hardware implementation still achieves misprediction rates that are within 1.2% of the ideal case.

Although e-mails are more convenient, letters still have many nice features. The ability to handle "anonymous recipient" is one of them. This research aims to develop a software agent that performs the routing task as human beings for the anonymous recipient e-mails. The software agent named "TWIMC (To Whom It May Concern)" receives anonymous recipient e-mails, analyze it, and then routes the e-mail to the mostly qualified person (i.e., e-mail account) inside the organization. The machine learning and automatic text categorization (ATC) techniques are applied for the task. We view each e-mail account as a category (or class) of ATC. Everyday e-mail collections for each e-mail account provide an excellent source of training data. The experiment shows the high possibility that TWIMC could be deployed in the real world.

The more cases the credit apportionment scheme can consider, the better is the overall systems performance. Currently rule based systems are used in various areas such as expert systems and machine learning which means that new rules to be generated and others to be eliminated. Several credit apportionment schemes have been proposed and some of them are even used but still most of these schemes suffer from disability of distinguishing between good rules and bad rules. Correct rules might be weakened because they are involved in an incorrect inference path (produces incorrect conclusion) and incorrect rules might be strengthen because they are involved in an inference path which produces correct conclusion. In this area a lot of research has been done, we consider three algorithms, Bucket Brigade algorithm (BB), Modified Bucket Algorithm (MBB) and General Credit Apportionment (GCA). The algorithms BB and MBB are from the same family in which they use the same credit allocation techniques where GCA uses different approach. In this research, we make a comparison study by implementing the three algorithms and apply them on a simulated "Soccer" expert rule-based system. To evaluate the algorithms, two experiments have been conducted.

This paper describes research into the understanding of such tacit control skills. Understanding tacit skills has practical motivation in respect of communicating skill to other operators, operator training, and also mechanising and optimising human skill. This paper is concerned with approaches whereby, using techniques of machine learning, controllers that emulate the human operators are generated from examples of control traces. This process is also called "behavioural cloning". The paper gives a review of ML-based approaches to behavioural cloning, representative experiments, and an assessment of the results. Some recent work is presented with particular emphasis on understanding human tacit skill, and generating explanation of how it works. This includes the extraction of the operator's subconscious sub-goals and the use of qualitative control strategies. We argue for qualitative problem representations and decomposition of the machine learning problem involved.

The general research questions that guide the project are laid out, and some of the most important results achieved so far are briefly summarized (with an emphasis on the most recent and still very speculative work). A broad view of the discovery process is given, from data acquisition issues through data visualization to inductive model building and pattern discovery. It is shown that it is indeed possible for a machine to make novel and interesting discoveries even in a domain like music. The report closes with a few general lessons learned and with the identification of a number of open and challenging research problems.

We use three dimensional data obtained through X-ray microtomography at greater than one micron resolution per voxel at five times in the hydration process: powder, after 4 hours, 7 hours, 15.5 hours, and after 6 days of hydration. Using statistics based on locality, we create vectors containing eight attributes for subsets of size 100(3) of the data and use the autoclass unsupervised classification system to label the attribute vectors into three separate classes. Following this, we use the C5 decision tree software to separate the three classes into two parts: class 0 and 1, and class 0 and 2. We use our locally developed procedural genetic programming system, GPP, to create simple rules for these. The resulting collection of simple rules are tested on a separate 100(3) subset of the plaster datasets that had been labeled with their autoclass predictions. The rules were found to have both high sensitivity and high positive predictive value. The classes accurately identify important structural comonents in the hydrating plaster. Morover, the rules identify the center of the local distribution as a critical factor in separating the classes.

Attribute-efficient learning algorithms can tolerate irrelevant attributes without their performance being affected too much. Valiant's projection learning is a way to combine such algorithms so that this desired property is maintained. The archetype attribute-efficient learning algorithm Winnow and, especially, combinations of Winnow have turned out empirically successful in domains containing many attributes. However, projection learning as proposed by Valiant has not yet been evaluated empirically. We study how projection learning relates to using Winnow as such and with an extended set of attributes. We also compare projection learning with decision tree learning and Naive Bayes on UCI data sets. Projection learning systematically enhances the classification accuracy of Winnow, but the cost in time and space consumption can be high. Balanced Winnow seems to be a better alternative than the basic algorithm for learning the projection hypotheses. However, Balanced Winnow is not well suited for learning the second level (projective disjunction) hypothesis. The on-line approach projection learning does not fall far behind in classification accuracy from batch algorithms such as decision tree learning and Naive Bayes on the UCI data sets that we used.

However, there are two important shortcomings associated with ensemble methods. Huge amounts of memory are required to store a set of multiple hypotheses and, more importantly, comprehensibility of a single hypothesis is lost. In this work, we devise a new method to extract one single solution from a hypothesis ensemble without using extra data, based on two main ideas: the selected solution must be similar, semantically, to the combined solution, and this similarity is evaluated through the use of a random dataset. We have implemented the method using shared ensembles, because it allows for an exponential number of potential base hypotheses. We include several experiments showing that the new method selects a single hypothesis with an accuracy which is reasonably close to the combined hypothesis.

In this paper, we use the framework of Bayesian networks to examine the problem of integrating the learning outputs for multiple overlapping datasets. In particular, we provide rules for extracting causal information about the true (unknown) Bayesian network from the previously learned (partial) Bayesian networks. We also provide the SLPR algorithm, which efficiently uses these previously learned Bayesian networks to guide learning of the full structure. A complexity analysis of the "worst-case" scenario for the SLPR algorithm reveals that the algorithm is always less complex than a comparable "reference" algorithm (though no absolute optimality proof is known). Although no "expected-case" analysis is given, the complexity analysis suggests that (given the currently available set of algorithms) one should always use the SLPR algorithm, regardless of the underlying generating structure. The results provided in this paper point to a wide range of open questions, which are briefly discussed.

The categorization is based on not only the body but also the header of an email message. The meta-data (e.g. sender name, organization, etc.) provide additional information that can be exploited and improve the categorization capability. Results of experiments on real email data demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. In particular, it is shown that categorization based only on the header information is comparable or superior to that based on all the information in a message.

However, scalability, accuracy and efficiency are significant concerns regarding how to effectively deal with large and complex data sets in the implementation. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning approach (we call our approach GAIT), combining genetic algorithm, statistical sampling, and decision tree, to develop intelligent decision trees that can alleviate some of these problems. We design our computational experiments and run GAIT on three different data sets (namely Socio-Olympic data, Westinghouse data, and FAA data) to test its performance against standard decision tree algorithm, neural network classifier, and statistical discriminant technique, respectively. The computational results show that our approach outperforms standard decision tree algorithm profoundly at lower sampling levels, and achieves significantly better results with less effort than both neural network and discriminant classifiers.

Because of its greedy search strategy, it is very efficient but suffers from incompleteness of search. Improvement is made on its search capability without imposing much computational complexity by 1) incorporating a beam search, 2) using a different evaluation function to extract patterns that are more discriminatory than those simply occurring frequently, and 3) adopting canonical labeling to enumerate identical patterns accurately. This new algorithm, now called Beam-wise GBI, B-GBI for short, was tested against a small DNA dataset from UCI repository and shown successful in extracting discriminatory substructures.

Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked as <table> elements, a <table> element does not necessarily indicate the presence of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10, 000 leaf <table> elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure of 95.88%.

We assume a broad category of structured documents for processing that goes beyond form processing. In fact, the documents may have flexible layouts and consist of multiple and varying numbers of pages. The data extraction method (DataX) employs general templates generated by the Inductive Template Generator (InTeGen). The InTeGen method utilizes inductive learning from examples of documents with identified data elements. Both methods achieve high automation with minimal user's input.

Handwriting samples of one thousand five hundred individuals, representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, ethnic groups, etc., were obtained. Analyzing differences in handwriting was done by using computer algorithms for extracting features from scanned images of handwriting. Attributes characteristic of the handwriting were obtained, e.g., line separation, slant, character shapes, etc. These attributes, which are a subset of attributes used by expert document examiners, were used to quantitatively establish individuality by using machine learning approaches. Using global attributes of hadwriting and very few characters in the writing, the ability to determine the writer with a high degree of confidence was established. The work is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting handwriting evidence in court. The mathematical approach and the resulting software also have the promise of aiding the expert document examiner.

In addition to the devices, also extremely reliable detection algorithms must be implemented. The design of such algorithms has traditionally been an analytical process demanding a vast amount of work and expertise. Thus, there is a strong interest of automatic machine learning methods. In this study, several machine learning methods are applied to a detector device measuring the ion mobility distribution for detecting and recognizing chemical warfare agents. The experimental results indicate that one of the proposed methods, the Bayesian classifier based method, is applicable even for critical applications.

The coding of the search space for the obtaining of decision rules is approached, i.e., the representation of the individuals of the genetic population. Two new methods for encoding discrete and continuous attributes are presented. Our "natural coding" uses one gene per attribute (continuous or discrete) leading to a reduction in the search space. Genetic operators for this approached natural coding are formally described and the reduction of the size of the search space is analysed for several databases from the UCI machine learning repository.

In particular, this framework enables proof planning systems to automatically learn new proof methods from well chosen examples of proofs which use a similar reasoning pattern to prove related theorems. Our framework consists of a representation formalism for methods and a machine learning technique which can learn methods using this representation formalism. We present the implementation of this framework within the OmegaMEGA proof planning system, and some experiments we ran on this implementation to evaluate the validity of our approach.

It aims at exploiting simultaneously labeled and unlabeled data for classification. We introduce here a new semi-supervised algorithm. Its originality is that it relies on a discriminative approach to semi-supervised learning rather than a generative approach, as it is usually the case. We present in details this algorithm for a logistic classifier and show that it can be interpreted as an instance of the Classification Expectation Maximization algorithm. We also provide empirical results on two data sets for sentence classification tasks and analyze the behavior of our methods.

An important open problem in this context is how to measure the distance between class codewords and the outputs of the classifiers. In this paper we propose a new decoding function that combines the margins through an estimate of their class conditional probabilities. We report experiments using support vector machines as the base binary classifiers, showing the advantage of the proposed decoding function over other functions of the margin commonly used in practice. We also present new theoretical results bounding the leave-one-out error of ECOC of kernel machines, which can be used to tune kernel parameters. An empirical validation indicates that the bound leads to good estimates of kernel parameters and the corresponding classifiers attain high accuracy.

In most interesting cases, however, full global optimization is not feasible and local search techniques are used to discover reasonable solutions. Unfortunately, the quality of the local maxima reached depends on initialization and is often weaker than the global maximum. In this paper, we present a simple approach for combining global search with local optimization to discover improved hypotheses in general machine learning problems. The main idea is to escape local maxima by perturbing the training data to create plausible new ascent directions, rather than perturbing hypotheses directly. Specifically, we consider example-reweighting strategies that are reminiscent of boosting and other ensemble learning methods, but applied in a different way with a different goal: to produce a single hypothesis that achieves a good score on training and test data. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms we consider a number of problems in learning Bayesian networks from data, including discrete training problems (structure search), continuous training problems (parametric EM, non-linear logistic regression), and mixed training problems (Structural EM) on both synthetic and real-world data. In each case, we obtain state of the art performance on both training and test data.

One principled approach to this problem is to represent the data in low dimension with minimal loss of the information contained in the original data. In this paper we present a novel information theoretic principle and algorithm for extracting low dimensional representations, or feature-vectors, that capture as much as possible of the mutual information between the variables. Unlike previous work in this direction, here we do not cluster or quantize the variables, but rather extract continuous feature functions directly from the co-occurrence matrix, using a converging iterative projection algorithm. The obtained features serve, in a well defined way, as approximate sufficient statistics that capture the information in a joint sample of the variables. Our approach is both simpler and more general than clustering or mixture models and is applicable to a wide range of problems, from document categorization to bioinformatics and analysis of neural codes.

In order to narrow down the gap between the low level and semantic level, in this study, we describe an efficient and effective image similarity calculation method for image comparison at object classes. It is not only suitable for images with single objects, but also for images containing multiple and partially occluded objects. In this approach, a machine learning algorithm is used to predict the classes of each of object-contour segments. The similarity measure between two images is been computed using Euclidean distance between images in the k-dimensional space. Experimental results show that this approach is effective, and is invariant to rotation, scaling, and translation of objects.

IEEE Comp Soc TC PAMI			EXPRESSIONS	We present ongoing work on a project for automatic recognition of spontaneous facial actions. Spontaneous facial expressions differ substantially from posed expressions, similar to how spontaneous speech differs from directed speech. Previous methods for automatic facial expression recognition assumed images were collected in controlled environments in which the subjects deliberately faced the camera. Since people often nod or turn their heads, automatic recognition of spontaneous facial behavior requires methods for handling out-of-image-plane head rotations. There are many promising approaches to address the problem of out-of-image plane rotations. In this paper we explore an approach based on 3D warping of images into canonical views. A front-end system was developed that jointly estimates camera parameters, head geometry and 3D head pose across entire sequences of video images. First a small set of images was used to estimate camera parameters and 3D face geometry. Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods were then used to recover the most likely sequence of 3D poses given a sequence of video images. Once the 3D pose was known, we warped each image into frontal views with a canonical face geometry. We evaluated the performance of the approach as a front-end for a spontaneous expression recognition system using support vector machines and hidden Markov models. This system employed general purpose learning mechanisms that can be applied to recognition of any facial movement. We showed that 3D tracking and warping followed by machine learning techniques directly applied to the warped images, is a viable and promising technology for automatic facial expression recognition. One exciting aspect of the approach presented here is that information about movement dynamics emerged out of filters which were derived from the statistics of images.

The robot soccer game presents an uncertain and dynamic environment for cooperating agents [1][2]. Dynamic role switching and formation control are crucial for a successful game.

We show that when TCM and ICM are used in the on-line mode, their confidence measures are well-calibrated, in the sense that predictive regions at confidence level 1 - delta will be wrong with relative frequency at most delta (approaching delta in the case of randomised TCM and ICM) in the long run. This is not just an asymptotic phenomenon: actually the error probability of randomised TCM and ICM is delta at every trial and errors happen independently at different trials.

An important source of noise consists in mislabeled training instances. We present a new approach that deals with improving classification accuracies in such a case by using a preliminary filtering procedure. An example is suspect when in its neighborhood defined by a geometrical graph the proportion of examples of the same class is not significantly greater than in the whole database. Such suspect examples in the training data can be removed or relabeled. The filtered training set is then provided as input to learning algorithm. Our experiments on ten benchmarks of UCI Machine Learning Repository using 1-NN as the final algorithm show that removing give better results than relabeling. Removing allows maintaining the generalization error rate when we introduce from 0 to 20% of noise on the class, especially when classes are well separable.

Relation between the two approaches allows Adaboost's example weighting strategy to be compared with the greedy covering strategy used for a long time in Machine Learning. The greedy covering strategy does not clearly show overfitting, it runs in at least one order of magnitude less time, it reaches zero error on the training set in few trials, and the error on the test set is most of the time comparable to that exhibited by AdaBoost.

However, standard data mining techniques, taken in isolation, seem to be inadequate to cope with such a task. In fact, symbolic approaches show difficulty in dealing with noise, while non-symbolic approaches, such as neural networks and statistics show difficulty in dealing with very long subsequences where relevant episodes may be interleaved with large gaps. The way out we suggest is to integrate the logic approach with non-symbolic methods in a unified paradigm, as it has been already done in other Artificial Intelligence tasks. We propose a framework where a high level knowledge representation is used to incorporate domain specific knowledge, to focus the attention on relevant episodes during the mining process, and flexible matching algorithms developed in the pattern recognition area are used to deal with noisy data. The knowledge extraction process follows a machine learning paradigm combining inductive and deductive learning, where deduction steps can be interleaved with induction steps aimed at augmenting a weak domain theory with knowledge extracted from the data. Our framework is formally characterized and then is experimentally tested on an artificial dataset showing its ability at dealing with noise and with the presence of long gaps between the relevant episodes.

Therefore efficient robust data mining algorithms should comprise some routines for processing these unknown values. The paper [5] figures out that each dataset has more or less its own 'favourite' routine for processing unknown attribute values. It evidently depends on the magnitude of noise and source of unknownness in each dataset. One possibility how to solve the above problem of selecting the right routine for processing unknown attribute values for a given database is exhibited in this paper. The covering machine learning algorithm CN4 processes a given database for six routines for unknown attribute values independently. Afterwards, a meta-learner (meta-combiner) is used to derive a meta-classifier that makes up the overall (final) decision about the class of input unseen objects. The results of experiments with various percentages of unknown attribute values on real-world data are presented and performances of the meta-classifier and the six base classifiers are then compared.

Therefore, some harmful data stream must be recognized and filtered out effectively. After analyzing some harmful contents in Internet information stream, we present a new method, which recognizes specific information by Machine Learning (ML). We extracted key information from a number of corpuses through ML method to obtain the part of speech (POS) Transfer-Form for key information by learning from corpuses, which is based on the same pronunciation matching of key information. Further more, the testing value of key information will be obtained in real corpus to examine the likelihood between matching rules from information streams and those learnt from corpuses through the average value of POS transfer probability of key information. Therefore, the testing value for the whole real data stream will be obtained The experiment proved that the method was efficient for recognizing certain Internet harmful information.

The algorithm is inspired by the natural behaviour of ants, which deposit pheromone in the environment to communicate. The benefit besides simulating ant behaviour in,a colony is to design complex multi-agent systems. Complex, behaviour can emerge from relatively simple interacting agents. The proposed Q-learning update equation includes a belief factor. The belief factor reflects the confidence the agent has in the pheromone detected in its environment. Agents communicate implicitly to co-ordinate and co-operate in learning to solve a problem.

Using reflexive structures to describe the actions and knowledge of the system, called views, we build chronicles that catch and register the actual situations related to events and actions occurrences. These chronicles are then intensionalised in order to extract regularities in a single autonomous agent's behaviour, thus defining a local behaviour. We then propose to extend this model for extracting collective behaviours in MAS using machine learning algorithms. Finally, we try to show that this dynamic analysis of an agent's runtime can lead to organisations in MAS.

The descriptions come in the form of models which offer the possibility of mechanically producing system tests, grading test suites and monitoring running systems. Regular extrapolation builds models from observations via techniques from machine learning and finite automata theory. Also expert knowledge about the system enters the model construction in a systematic way. The power of this approach is illustrated in the context of a test environment for telecommunication systems.

Experimental results show competing performance (95.1%) with the non-trainable recognizer (95.8%) previously developed, with obvious gains in flexibility and expandability.

In this work, we present an approach to the automated interpretation of vectorized topographic maps. It is based on the generation of logic descriptions of maps and the application of symbolic Machine Learning tools to these descriptions. This paper focuses on the definition of computational methods for the generation of logic descriptions of map cells and briefly describes the use of these logic descriptions in an inductive learning task.

The aim of the paper was to compare two machine learning (ML) systems and propose method for intra- and inter-testing of consistency and reproducibility in attributes extracted from real dataset. See5 and FMLS extracted relevant attributes from real medical dataset. Comparison of results of both systems shows that: accuracy and sensitivity are nearly the same for both FMLS and See5 when FMLS was forced by attributes extracted by See5, and little bit lower when FMLS used its own extracted attributes; specificity is nearly the same for both FMLS and See5 when FMLS was forced by attributes extracted by See5, and much more higher when FMLS used its own extracted attributes; both of ML systems show intra-testing consistency and does not show any inter-testing consistency.

We show that they are not really metrics, but pseudometrics. The problem arose from missing values. The metrics can be redefined to satisfy the metricity definition. Distance computation can then be performed reliably without a possibility that a distance between exactly similar patient cases would not be zero. We experimented with both procedures and so-called ignore mode using two medical data sets and observed that the redefined procedure was as good as the original approach as measured with the classification ability of one-nearest neighbour searching. It is noticeable that the described problem caused by missing values can be with any distance measure if its missing values are treated in the pessimistic manner as in the original version of these distance measures.

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that little is known about which techniques are suited to which types of problems. This paper provides some insights into the data characteristics that suit particular data mining algorithms. Our approach consists of four main stages. First, the performance of six leading data mining algorithms is examined across a collection of 57 well-known classification problems from the machine learning literature. Secondly, a collection of statistics that describe each of the 57 problems in terms of data complexity is collated. Thirdly, a self-organising map (SOM) is used to cluster the 57 problems based on these measures of complexity. Each cluster represents a group of classification problems with similar data characteristics. The performance of each data mining algorithm within each cluster is then examined in the Final stage to provide both quantitative and qualitative insights into which techniques perform best on certain problem types.

The main idea is to describe the influence of the change of one parameter on another. In this algorithm we generate sets of classification rules. We define a coefficient of significance for every single rule. This coefficient describes for a test example a degree of membership of the class predicted by the rule. A new example is classified into a class for which its total degree of membership is maximal. In this way the effect of a single non-informative rule having occurred by chance is decreased due the coefficient of significance. The fuzzy derivative method is mainly used to study systems with qualitative features, but it also can be used for systems with quantitative features. The algorithm is applied to classification problems and comparisons made with other techniques.

In this paper we argue on theoretical grounds that LD is in fact more appropriate when training data is sparse, and the dimension of the space is extremely high. To support this conclusion we present experimental results on a medical text classification problem of great practical importance, autocoding of adverse event reports. We trained and tested LD-based systems for a variety of classification schemes widely used in the clinical drug trial process (COSTART, WHOART, HARTS, and MedDRA) and obtained significant reduction in the rate of misclassification compared both to generic Bayesian machine-learning techniques and to the current generation of domain-specific autocoders based on string matching.

Although the parallels between dynamic Bayesian networks and Kalman filters are well-known since many years, Bayesian networks have not been applied to problems in the area of adaptive control of dynamic systems. In our work we exploit the well-known similarities between Bayesian networks and Kalman filters to model and control linear dynamic systems using dynamic Bayesian networks. The analytical models are compared with models being trained with step and impulse response. The experiments show that the analytical model as well as the trained model are suitable for control purposes, which leads to the idea of self adaptive controllers.

J	Perrone, MP; Russell, GF; Ziq, A				Perrone, MP; Russell, GF; Ziq, A			Machine learning in a multimedia document retrieval framework	IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article								The Pen Technologies group at IBM Research has recently been investigating methods for retrieving handwritten documents based on user queries. This paper investigates the use of typed and handwritten documents. The IBM handwriting recognition engine was used to generate N-best lists for the words in each of 108 short documents. These N-best lists are concise statistical representations of the handwritten words. These statistical representations enable the retrieval methods to be robust when there are machine transcription errors, allowing retrieval of documents that would be missed by a traditional transcription-based retrieval system. Our experimental results demonstrate that significant improvements in retrieval performance can be achieved compared to standard keyword text searching of machine-transcribed documents. We have developed a software architecture for a multimedia document retrieval framework into which machine learning algorithms for feature extraction and matching may be easily integrated. The framework provides a "plug-and-play" mechanism for the integration of new media types, new feature extraction methods, and the new document types.

In this paper, we present our work on applying machine learning to be automated generation of information graphics. Our approach is embodied in a hybrid graphics generation system, IMPROVISE*, which uses both rule-based and example-based generation engines. We discuss the use of machine learning to support such systems from three aspects. First, we introduce an object-oriented, integrated hierarchical feature representation for annotating information graphics. Second, we describe how to use decision-tree learning to automatically extract design rules from a set of annotated graphic examples. Our results demonstrate that we can acquire, with quantitative confidence, concise rules that are difficult to obtain in handcrafted rules. Third, we present a case-based learning method to retrieve matched graphic examples based on user requests. Specifically, we use a semantics-based, quantitative visual similarity measuring algorithm to retrieve the top-k matched examples from a visual database. To help users browse a graphics database and understand the inherent relations among different examples, we combined our similarity measuring model with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to dynamically organize our graphic examples based on user interests.

A soft-computing technique in the form of fuzzy neural networks is used to perform the intelligent processing of categorising colours given some training. The main hypothesis suggests that the neural network will not perform as well as a human familiar with the NCS colour space, because humans possess context knowledge needed to correctly classify any colour variety into eleven groupings. This paper describes the process taken to create the dataset suitable for the network, and reports on the use of the software called FuzzyCOPE 3(C) to investigate this hypothesis. Further, it points to issues such as what is context knowledge? Can the network's learning be said to possess contextual knowledge of the colour space?

The RBF networks constructed with the proposed learning algorithm generally are able to deliver the same level of classification accuracy as the support vector machines (SVM). One important advantage of the proposed learning algorithm, in comparison with the support vector machines, is that the proposed learning algorithm normally takes far less time to figure out optimal parameter values with cross validation. A comparison with the SVM is of interest, because it has been shown in a number of recent studies that the SVM generally is able to deliver higher level of accuracy than the other existing data classification algorithms. The proposed learning algorithm works by constructing one RBF network to approximate the probability density function of each class of objects in the training data set. The main distinction of the proposed learning algorithm is how it exploits local distributions of the training samples in determining the optimal parameter values of the basis functions. As the proposed learning algorithm is instance-based, the data reduction issue is also addressed in this paper. One interesting observation is that, for all three data sets used in data reduction experiments, the number of training samples remaining after a naive data reduction mechanism is applied is quite close to the number of support vectors identified by the SVM software.

Typically, a radial basis function is usually realized by a Gaussian distribution function. Although, this function is popular and has some useful properties, rotating, translating, and scaling the shape of this function in a high dimensional require costly teaming time. In this paper, two related issues are considered. The first issue concerns the problem of developing a new radial basis function with less learning time. The second issue focuses on the mathematical model of fault immunization of the proposed elliptic radial basis function. We consider only the data in a two dimensional space and test our solutions with some benchmarked data. The immunization technique increases the fault immunization degree ranging from 2% to 26%.

In comparison with the existing learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm features lower time complexity for constructing the RBF network and is able to deliver the same level of accuracy. The time taken by the proposed algorithm to construct the RBF network is in the order of O(\S\), where S is the set of training samples. As far as the time complexity for predicting the function values of input vectors is concerned, the RBF network constructed with the proposed learning algorithm can complete the task in O(\T\), where T is the set of input vectors. Another important feature of the proposed learning algorithm is that the space complexity of the RBF network constructed is O(m\S\), where m is the dimension of the vector space in which the target function is defined.

It has been shown to perform extremely well for a. number of problems in classification and regression. However, in many difficult problems, the system dynamics may change with time and the resulting new information arriving incrementally will provide additional data. At present, there is limited work to cope with the computational demands of modeling time varying systems. Therefore, we, develop the concept of adaptive support vector machines that can learn from incremental data. In this paper, results are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the adaptive support vector machines techniques for pattern classification and regression problems.

It is impossible to classify this information with one's own hand one by one in many realistic problems, so that the research on automatic text classification has been grown. Machine learning technologies have applied in text classification. However, the traditional statistic machine learning technologies require large number of labeled training examples to learn accurately. To obtain enough training examples, we have to label on these huge training examples by hand. This paper presents a supervised learning algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) to classify text documents more accurately by using unlabeled documents to augment available labeled training examples. Experimental results indicate that the classification with unlabeled examples using SVM is superior to the conventional classification with labeled examples.

Today's Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly equipment is able to generate huge volumes of data for identification of machine process quality v parameters, but most of this information is currently underutilized on the manufacturing floor. Each process step, e.g., component assembly, can be characterized by twelve to thirty parameters. However, it is not easy to analyze these parameters. One promising technique is machine learning based on Data Mining techniques Using neural networks many parameters can be compared, and a process model can be generated, even when using "raw" unfiltered process data, as demonstrated in this paper for a solder printing process, characterized by sixteen parameters. The important input parameters, as identified by a neural network model, have been collected either on-or offline to create the core database for extracting the reference model. Each of the datasets contains the x/y/theta-correction, idle time up/down and pre-/post-pressure as well as the average pad-stack coverage Different test scenarios were run to identify, the best-fit reference machine model. This paper compares the results obtained with different configurations of the machine-learning algorithm, in terms of their prediction accuracy, identified model parameters, and model structure. Reference models with up to 99% accuracy have been obtained for actual production scenarios.

In this work, artificial intelligence techniques are investigated for sensor fusion, aiming the improvement of the accuracy and reliability of the distance measure between a robot and an object in its work environment, based on measures obtained from different sensors. The artificial intelligence techniques consist of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and their combination in committees. The results obtained suggest the potential of combining different sensor fusion techniques in committees.

Irrespective of the way the transformation of knowledge, the developed methods usually fall into two classes: methods with high rate of transformed knowledge is done, but with a lot of restrictions concerning the type of data in the training sets, training methods, and the size of data sets; and methods with moderate rate of transformed knowledge, but with less restrictions. Our main interest was to find or develop a technique that would possess the knowledge acquisition power of neural networks and explanation power of decision trees That is why we developed a NN-DT Cascade methods an embedded hybrid of neural networks and decision trees, which is capable of transforming a part of knowledge from the neural network into a decision tree.

Existing methods for retrieval of text often use stemming to retain common roots and base recall on these root words [1,4,5,9]. This requires the removal of stop words, e.g., numbers, symbols, high frequency bid low semantic weight words, thereby precluding phrases using these words [2]. In addition stemming is a morphologic approach that cannot readily process homonyms, synonyms and certain inflectional and derived forms [4.5]. Machine learning approaches assign words to categories [5,6,7,81, but application to a large corpus remains in debate [4]. For this study, we describe the application of the Cortronic theory and methods developed by Robert Hecht-Nielsen [2.3] to information retrieval of text word pairs. Hecht-Nielsen's theories build on associative memory artificial neural networks (AMNNs) introduced by Steinbuch [10] and extended by Willshaw et al. [ 11] especially in regards sparseness [2,3]. The AADNs are used to process a large corpus without excluding stop words, and retain the joint probability of mutual occurrences that allows rapid retrieval of word pairs. This AMNN approach includes three key components: representation of arbitrary objects (words), learning and knowledge accumulation based on measurement of co-occurrence and use of all the learned knowledge to produce (predict) the missing word in a phrase.

This paper proposes, a novelty Machine Learning approach to the detection of splice site location in DNA sequences. The method is based on a hybrid of a Markov model and neural networks where parameters of the Markov model are learned by neural networks. Our proposed model is trained using a backpropagation algorithm. The experiments in the data set of Rogic show that this model performs well that 86% of acceptor sites and 89% of donor sites are correctly found. These results demonstrate the potential use of our approach.

The total load demand curve is measured at the entrance of the power line into the house. The power consumption of individual appliances can be estimated using several machine learning techniques by analyzing the characteristic frequency contents from the load curve of the household. We have already developed the monitoring system of ON/OFF states [4, 5]. This system could establish sufficient accuracy. In the next phase, the monitoring system should be able to estimate the power consumption for an air conditioner with an inverter circuit. In this paper, we present results of applying several regression methods such as multilayered perceptrons (MLP), radial basis function networks (RBFN) and support vector regressors (SVR) to estimate the power consumption of an air conditioner. Our experiments show that RBFN can achieve the best accuracy for the non-intrusive monitoring system.

The hypothesis that market sentiment and IPO specific attributes are equally responsible for first-day IPO returns in the US stock market is tested. Machine learning methods used are Bayesian classifications, support vector machines, decision tree techniques, rule learners and artificial neural networks. The outcomes of the research are predictions and rules associated with first-day returns of Technology IPOs. The hypothesis that first-day returns of Technology IPOs are equally determined by IPO specific and market sentiment is rejected. Instead tower yielding IPOs are determined by IPO specific and market sentiment attributes, while higher yielding IPOs are largely dependent on IPO specific attributes.

However, the effectiveness of features extracted by ICA (ICA features) has not been verified yet. As one of the reasons, it is considered that ICA features are obtained by increasing their independence rather than by increasing their class separability. Hence, we can expect that high-performance pattern features are obtained by introducing supervisor into conventional ICA algorithms such that the class separability of features is enhanced. In this work, we propose SICA by maximizing Mahalanobis distance between classes. Moreover, we propose a new distance measure in which each ICA feature is weighted by the power of principal components consisting of the ICA feature. In the recognition experiments, we demonstrate that the better recognition accuracy for two data sets in UCI Machine Learning Repository is attained when using features extracted by the proposed SICA.

However, when there is one or more non-ordinal data in feature vector, metric evaluation is difficult. Although non-metric methods such as decision trees with ID3, C4.5 or CART can be employed to process such problems, many other elegant approaches cannot be applied due to the lack of numerical information. We propose constructing minimum error based intra-feature metric matrices to provide distance measure for nominal data so that metric or kernel algorithms can be used. For each nominal attribute, a matrix is first initialized to constant values with zero diagonal and then the off diagonal values are tuned based on minimizing the training error. The optimized matrices give the distance information between nominal values and thus can be referenced in various metric algorithms. Experimental results with classical Boolean nominal metric and C4.5 on various datasets show that the proposed approach gives superior performance.

This paper presents a method to implement learning in a fuzzy controller where the learning is based on the past performance of the. controller against a disturbance. A second fuzzy system is used to evaluate the control performance in terms of rise time and overshoot. The performance is quantitatively expressed as a fuzzy performance index. The reinforcement type of learning mechanism employed in the controller uses the performance index as a feedback. After a distubance, consequence values of the fuzzy rules which were activated during the transient are ajusted based on the fuzzy performacne index and other information such as truth values of the rules and proces errors. The working of the learning process is illustrated through a simulation example of a chemical reactor.

To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face regardless of its three-dimensional position, orientation, and lighting conditions, Such a problem is challenging because faces a-re nonrigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics, and benchmarking. After analyzing these algorithms and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research.

Supervised machine learning techniques are used to discover patterns in the data and develop associated classification and parameter estimation algorithms. These methods are applied to cloud classification in GOES imagery, tropical cyclone intensity estimation using SSM/I data, and cloud ceiling height estimation at remote locations using appropriate geostationary and polar orbiting satellite data in conjunction with numerical weather prediction output and climatology. All developed algorithms rely on training data sets that consist of records of attributes (computed from the appropriate data source) and the associated ground truth.

One area in which such techniques are particularly useful is classification of remotely sensed data for land cover and vegetation mapping applications. In this paper, we describe new methods to include available information (domain knowledge) in supervised classification of land cover using high dimensional remote sensing observations. specifically, land cover and vegetation classification schemes are generally designed for ecological or land use applications. As a result, the classes of interest are often poorly separable in the multi-spectral or multi-temporal feature space provided by remote sensing. In many cases, ancillary data sources can provide useful information to help distinguish between problematic classes. However, available methods for including ancillary data sources, such as the use of prior probabilities in maximum likelihood classification, are often problematic in practice. This paper presents a method for incorporating prior probabilities in remote sensing-based land cover classification using a supervised decision tree classification algorithm. The method exploits recent theory from the domain of statistics and machine learning that allows robust estimates of class membership to be estimated using a technique known as boosting. This approach allows poorly separable classes to be distinguished based on ancillary information, but does not penalize rare classes. Further, the proposed approach can incorporate incomplete or flawed prior knowledge using a confidence estimate that weights the influence of outside information relative to its quality. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we show how it is being used to help map land cover using multi-temporal MODIS data.

In this paper, we study the issue of building a risk-sensitive intrusion detection model. To determinate whether a system calls sequence is normal or not, we consider not only the probability of this sequence belonging to normal sequences set or intrusion sequences set, but also the risk of a false detection. We define the risk model to formulate the expected risk of an intrusion detection decision, and present risk-sensitive machine learning techniques that can produce detection model to minimize the risks of false negatives and false positives. Meanwhile, this model is a hybrid model that combines misuse intrusion detection and anomaly intrusion detection. To achieve a satisfying performance, some techniques are applied to extend this model.

It could play an even more prominent role in the creation of computation systems capable of supporting intelligent agent behaviors because of the even higher level of complexity. The prospect of a self-bootstrapping, self-improving intelligent system has motivated various fields of research in machine learning. However, a robust, generalizable methodology of machine learning is yet to be found; there are still a lot of learning behaviors that no existing learning technique can adequately account for. We believe a uniform, logic-based system such as active logic [1, 2], will be more successful in the realization of this ideal. The overall architecture that we envision is as follows: a central commonsense reasoner module attends to novel situations where the system does not already have expertise, and to its own failures; it then reasons its way to solutions or repairs, and puts these into action while at the same time causing "expert" modules to be either created or retrained so as to more quickly enact those solutions on future occasions. Thus what we propose is a kind of meld between declarative and procedural techniques where the former has great expressive power and flexibility (but is slow) and the latter is very fast but hard to adapt to new situations. We will explore the possibilities of using reflection and continual computation toward this end.

The method is for an agent (1) that has to find its control strategy by trial-based approach, (2) that co-exists with other agents which may also be adaptively controlled, and (3) that does not have communication channels to the other agents. In this scheme the agent have to find a control policy of maximising its objective function under the existence of others, by only through sensory observation of the other machines. Our approach is to model the cumulative behaviour of the other agents as a low dimensional dynamical system. The model is used in conjunction with a machine learning method, which tries to find best policy under the existence of others. We discuss this by using non-linear time series prediction as the model and the Reinforcement learning as the learner. Wide-area optimisation for adaptive traffic signal controllers is introduced as a test problem.

In this paper, a rough genetic algorithm (RGA) is applied to the classification problem in an undetermined environment based on a fuzzy distance function by calculating attribute weights. The RGA, a genetic algorithm based on rough values, can complement the existing tools developed in rough computing. Computational experiments are conducted on benchmark problems downloaded from UCI machine learning databases. Experimental results, compared with the usual GA [1] and C4.5 algorithms, verify the efficiency of the developed algorithm. Furthermore, the weights acquired by the proposed learning method are applicable not only to fuzzy similarity functions but also to any similarity functions. As an application, a new distance metric called weighted discretized value difference metric (WDVDM) is proposed. Experimental results show that WDVDM is an improvement on the discretized value difference metric (DVDM).

Fundamental benefits are: a significant decreasing of learning time, a possible improvement of knowledge quality in case of noisy data, an increasing of knowledge legibility. In this paper we show analysis of a multidiscretizer which allows to apply a wide range of supervised discretization algorithms and which has very good abilities of tuning. Designed multidiscretizer allows to generate new supervised discretization algorithms and also variants similar to well known classic discretization algorithms such as e.g., ChiMerge. The multidiscretizer is based on top-down method and bottom-up one. It uses many measures which are mainly used in induction of decision trees and a few stop criterions. In this paper we study quality of the discretization generated by the multidiscretizer through evaluation of decision trees' accuracy. We focus on comparison of top-down method with bottom-up one and also the measures for the configuration presented below. For discretization research we use decision tree induction algorithms C4.5 and ID3.

The datasets are stored in a relational database and employed in the learning process through an SQL-style command that automatically executes the AQ20 rule learning program and generates user models. The models are in the form of attributional rulesets that are more expressive than conventional decision rules, and are easy to interpret and understand. Early experimental results from the testing of the LUS method gave highly encouraging results.

We have designed a flexible self-updating system that can work with new topics, new terms, and in different fields. Our system starts with little knowledge about the subjects according to which it should categorize the documents. For the first few documents we help the system to gain some knowledge to categorize them by adding some keywords to its database. For the next documents our help will be reduced to the point that we almost stop giving any at all. Our system can also add new topics and break old topics down into subtopics as the user defines them. It uses a part-of-speech tagger to identify proper nouns and proper noun phrases in addition to the nouns used in most other research in this area.

Experiments using simulated students can help clarify issues of instructional design, such as when a complex skill can be better learned by being broken into components. This paper describes two formative evaluations using simulated students that shed light on the potential benefits and limitations of mastery learning. Using an ACT-R based cognitive model (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998) we show that while mastery learning can contribute to success in some cases (Corbett & Anderson, 1995), it may actually impede learning in others. Mastery learning was crucial to learning success in an experiment comparing a traditional early algebra curriculum to a novel one presenting verbal problems first. However, in a second experiment, an instructional manipulation that contradicts mastery learning led to greater success than one consistent with it. In that experiment learning was better when more difficult problems were inserted earlier in the instructional sequence. Such problems are more difficult not because they have more components but because they cannot be successfully solved using shallow procedures that work on easier problems.

It is not realistic to assume that each new student has the same prior knowledge concerning the topic being taught, be it nothing or some "standard" prior knowledge. We introduce CLARISSE, which is a novel categorization method. We illustrate this tool with the identification of categories among students for QUANTI, an intelligent tutoring system for the teaching of quantum information processing. In order to classify a new learner, CLARISSE generates an adaptive pre-test that can identify with high accuracy the learner's category after very few questions.

A great deal of the discussion focuses on the use of reinforcement teaming techniques, specifically the ?-greedy and temporal difference TD(0) methods in deriving tutoring policies over a class of students. Future works will deal on incremental teaming and modification of learned policies while the tutor performs on-line in real-time, and extracting and teaming the way expert tutors execute their tutoring activities.

Thus, it may also be valid to explain group learning performance. However, teachers in both conventional classrooms and web learning systems are difficult to figure out what role a student played in a group and what relationship between existence of roles and group performance. In a web learning system, interactions among group members can be recorded in a database. Computer tools can be developed to do the tasks for teachers. In this paper we develop a tool to capture the roles that a student plays in her/his learning group. Then, tools using machine learning techniques are built to find the relationship between existence of roles and group performance. A tool then built to predict the group performance based on the relationship captured. Experiment result is shown that demonstrates that role theory is effective to predict group performance.

By indexing collected documents on topic path in taxonomy, taxonomy-based search engines can improve the search result qualities. However, the searches are limited to the locally compiled databases. In this paper we propose an adaptive web search method to improve the search result qualities enabling the users to search in many databases existing in the web space. The method has a characteristic that combines the taxonomy-based search engines and a machine learning technique. Afore specifically, we construct a rule-based classifier using pre-classified documents provided by a taxonomy-based search engine based on a selected context category on its taxonomy, and then use it to modify the user query. The resulting modified query will be sent to the crawler-based search engines and the returned results will be presented to the user. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by showing that the returned results from the modified query almost contain documents that will be categorized into the selected context category.

The problem is therefore noticed to the organization having in charge the maintenance, and it should be correctly and quickly dispatched to the right maintenance team. We propose to automatically classify incoming maintenance requests (also said tickets), routing them to specialized maintenance teams. The final goal is to develop a router, working around the clock, that, without human intervention, dispatches incoming tickets with the lowest mis-classification error, measured with respect to a given routing policy. 6000 maintenance tickets from a large, multi-site, software system, spanning about two years of system in-field operation, were used to compare and assess the accuracy of different classification approaches (i.e., Vector Space model, Bayesian model, support vectors, classification trees and k-nearest neighbor classification). The application and the tickets were divided into eight areas and pre-classified by human experts. Preliminary results were encouraging, up to 84% of the incoming tickets were correctly classified.

In order to further enhance recognition recall and precision, the authors propose an error correction approach for Chinese named entity recognition. In the error correction component, transformation-based machine learning is adopted because it is suitable to fix Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging errors and produce effective correcting rules automatically. The Chinese named entity recognition component utilizes Finite-State Cascades which are. automatically constructed by POS rules with semantic constraints. A prototype system, CNERS (Chinese Named Entity Recognition System), has been implemented. The experimental result shows that the recognition performance of most named entities have significantly been improved. On the other hand, the system is also fast and reliable.

The user is asked to imagine the scene and to draw inferences. We present a new approach to generate depictions of such scenes. Besides of drawing spatial inferences, this leads to the problem of solving a system of complicated numerical constraints. In contrast to qualitative spatial reasoning, we use a metric description where relations between pairs of objects are represented by parameterized homogenous transformation matrices with numerical (nonlinear) constraints. We employ methods of machine learning in combination with a new algorithm for generating depictions from text including spatial inference.

To determine which machine learning classifier learns best to interpret standard automated perimetry (SAP) and to compare the best of the machine classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC 2 and with experts in glaucoma. METHODS. Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), mixture of Gaussian (MoG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG) classifiers were trained and tested by cross validation on the numerical plot of absolute sensitivity plus age of 189 normal eves and 156 glaucomatous eves, designated as such by the appearance of the optic nerve. The authors compared performance of these classifiers with the global indices of STATPAC, using the area under the ROC curve. Two human experts were judged against the machine classifiers and the global indices by plotting their sensitivity specificity pairs. RESULTS. MoG had the greatest area under the ROC curve of the machine classifiers. Pattern SD (PSD) and corrected PSD (CPSD) had the largest areas under the curve of the global indices. MoG had significantly greater ROC area than PSD and CPSD. Human experts were not better at classifying visual fields than the machine classifiers or the global indices. CONCLUSIONS. MoG, using the entire visual field and age for input, interpreted SAP better than the global indices of STATPAC. Machine classifiers may augment the global indices of STATPAC.

In the present paper the essential differences between the conventional and the novel approach are summarized At the cost of the use of a simple dynamic model, a priori known, uniform, lucid, structure of reduced size, machine learning by a simple and short explicit algebraic procedure especially fit to real time applications considerable computational advantages can be achieved. The key element of the advantages approach the Modified Renormalization Transformation supported by the application of a simple linear transformation, and the use of a simple prediction technique. It is analyzed how the satisfactory conditions of the "Complete Stability" can be guaranteed, and the convergence properties can be improved by the ancillary methods. Simulation examples are presented for the control of a 3 DOF SCARA arm by the use of Partially Stretched orthogonal transformations.

The previous works in this area employed a large number of labeled training documents for supervised learning. The problem is that, it is difficult to create the labeled training documents. While it is easy to collect the unlabeled documents, it is not so easy to manually categorize them for creating training documents. Therefore, a new Machine learning algorithm Should be investigated to overcome these difficulties. Me proposed a new algorithm called Iterative Cross-Training (ICT). The paper also present a new feature set which is the hierarchical structure of headings appearing in the Web page to enhance the classification performance. We found that the hierarchical structure of headings has a high impact and could enhance the classification performance.

The stand-alone GPS based position estimation problem using GPS pseudo-range and Doppler shifts measurements are described. A model for position and velocity estimation are developed. The model is nonlinear and has variable measurement number for coping with an arbitrary number of satellites. Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. In this work the use of an alternative filter: the unscented kalman filter (UKF) is proposed. The first experimental results that comprise the comparison of estimation results obtained with a simple model using different filters are then presented. Future research directions are also discussed.

J	Nock, R				Nock, R			Inducing interpretable voting classifiers without trading accuracy for simplicity: Theoretical results, approximation algorithms, and experiments	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							RULES	Recent advances in the study of voting classification algorithms have brought empirical and theoretical results clearly showing the discrimination power of ensemble classifiers. It has been previously argued that the search of this classification power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need to obtain interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep classification strength is being rased in a growing number of machine learning or data mining papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theroetically and empirically the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into the hardness of the simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. then we provide an efficient "top-down and prune" induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is to our knowledge the first attempt to build a voting classifier as a base formula using the weak learning framework (the one which was previously highly successful for decision tree induction), and not the strong learning framework (as usual for such classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a well-known induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC also relies on recent or new results we give about particular cases of boosting known as partition boosting and ranking loss boosting.

However, in order for ILP to become practically useful, the efficiency of ILP systems must improve substantially. To this end, the notion of a query pack is introduced: it structures sets of similar queries. Furthermore, a mechanism is described for executing such query packs. A complexity analysis shows that considerable efficiency improvements can be achieved through the use of this query pack execution mechanism. This claim is supported by empirical results obtained by incorporating support for query pack execution in two existing learning systems.

J	Wolpert, DH; Tumer, K				Wolpert, DH; Tumer, K			Collective intelligence, data routing and Braess' paradox	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							NONCOOPERATIVE NETWORKS; CONGESTION; CAPACITY; TRAGEDY; COMMONS	We consider the problem of designing the the utility functions of the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) so that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing by placing agents on all the routers in the network. Conventional approaches to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA). We demonstrate that in many cases, due to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's performance, having agents use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route infinitesimally small amounts of traffic. The utility functions of the individual agents are not "aligned" with the global utility, intuitively speaking. As a particular example of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new links to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the agents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to "side-effects", in this case of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess' paradox.

J	Doniger, S; Hofmann, T; Yeh, J				Doniger, S; Hofmann, T; Yeh, J			Predicting CNS permeability of drug molecules: comparison of neural network and support vector machine algorithms	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						neural net; support vector machine; machine-learning algorithms; blood brain barrier; central nervous system; predictive methods; kernel methods	BRAIN-BARRIER PERMEATION; BLOOD; DESCRIPTORS	Two different machine-learning algorithms have been used to predict the blood-brain barrier permeability of different classes of molecules, to develop a method to predict the ability of drug compounds to penetrate the CNS. The first algorithm is based on a multilayer perceptron neural network and the second algorithm uses a support vector machine. Both algorithms are trained on an identical data set consisting of 179 CNS active molecules and 145 CNS inactive molecules. The training parameters include molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bonding, and other variables that govern the ability of a molecule to diffuse through a membrane. The results show that the support vector machine outperforms the neural network. Based on over 30 different validation sets, the SVM can predict up to 96% of the molecules correctly, averaging 81.5% over 30 test sets, which comprised of equal numbers of CNS positive and negative molecules. This is quite favorable when compared with the neural network's average performance of 75.7% with the same 30 test sets. The results of the SVM algorithm are very encouraging and suggest that a classification tool like this one will prove to be a valuable prediction approach.

J	Soibelman, L; Kim, H				Soibelman, L; Kim, H			Data preparation process for construction knowledge generation through knowledge discovery in databases	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						data processing; databases; neural networks; construction industry; data analysis	NEURAL NETWORKS	As the construction industry is adapting to new computer technologies in terms of hardware and software, computerized construction data are becoming increasingly available. The explosive growth of many business, government, and scientific databases has begun to far outpace our ability to interpret and digest the data. Such volumes of data clearly overwhelm the traditional methods of data analysis such as spreadsheets and ad-hoc queries. The traditional methods can create informative reports from data, but cannot analyze the contents of those reports, A significant need exists for a new generation of techniques and tools with the ability to automatically assist humans in analyzing the mountains of data for useful knowledge. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining (DM) are tools that allow identification of valid, useful, and previously unknown patterns so that the construction manager may analyze the large amount of construction project data. These technologies combine techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to automatically extract concepts, interrelationships, and patterns of interest from large databases. This paper presents the necessary steps such as (1) identification of problems, (2) data preparation, (3) data mining, (4) data analysis, and (5) refinement process required for the implementation of KDD. In order to test the feasibility of the proposed approach, a prototype of the KDD system was developed and tested with a construction management database, RMS (Resident Management System), provided by the U. S. Corps of Engineers. In this paper, the KDD process was applied to identify the cause(s) of construction activity delays. However, its possible applications can be extended to identify cause(s) of cost overrun and quality control/assurance among other construction problems. Predictable patterns may be revealed in construction data that were previously thought to be chaotic.

Machine Learning algorithms, which are extensively applied in many areas of the real world, are not still popular in the Bioinformatics community. We report on the successful application of four well known supervised Machine Learning methods (IB1, Naive-Bayes. C4.5 and CN2) to cancer class prediction problems in three DNA microarray datasets of huge dimensionality (Colon, Leukemia and NCI-60). The essential gene selection process in microarray domains is performed by a sequential search engine, evaluating the goodness of each gene subset by a wrapper approach which executes, by a leave-one-out process, the supervised algorithm to obtain its accuracy estimation. By the use of the gene selection procedure, the accuracy of supervised algorithms is significantly improved and the number of genes of the classification models is notably reduced for all datasets.

J	Gamberger, D; Lavrac, N; Krstacic, G				Gamberger, D; Lavrac, N; Krstacic, G			Confirmation rule induction and its applications to coronary heart disease diagnosis and risk group discovery	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article								The confirmation rule set concept, presented in this paper. provides a framework for reliable decision making. This framework enables flexible formation of a confirmation rule set. by incorporating rules induced by machine learning algorithms as well as human encoded expert rules. The only conditions for including a rule into the confirmation rule set are its high predictive accuracy and relative independence from other rules in the rule set. This paper introduces the concept of confirmation rule sets. together with an algorithm for selecting relatively independent rules from a set of acceptable confirmation rules. It presents also two approaches to confirmation rule induction: first. an exhaustive confirmation rule construction algorithm that was used to discover diagnostic rules in the coronary heart disease diagnosis problem. and second, a heuristic confirmation rule construction algorithm that was used for subgroup discovery in the coronary heart disease risk group detection problem.

A new learning algorithm is briefly presented, and then an experiment with a very large data set (performances of 13 Mozart piano sonatas) is described. The new learning algorithm succeeds in discovering some extremely simple and general principles of musical performance (at the level of individual notes), in the form of categorical prediction rules. These rules turn out to be very robust and general: when tested on performances by a different pianist and even on music of a different style (Chopin), they exhibit a surprisingly high degree of predictive accuracy.

Even if pricing theory represents a kernel domain of economic research the pricing problem related to automated information production processes could not be handled satisfactory. This stems from the combination of high fixed costs with negligible variable costs. Especially in airline industries this problem is addressed by heuristics in the so called "Yield Management" (YM) domain. The paper presented here, shows the transferability of these methods to the information production and services domain. Pricing a bundle of complementary resources can not be solved by the simple addition of value functions. Therefore we introduce Machine Learning (ML) techniques to master complexity. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used for the joint representation of the multidimensional value functions and Genetic Algorithms (GA) should help train them in a first effort. While this does not lead to outstanding results, we try Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a second approach. This ML method provides encouraging results for efficient adaptive pricing of resource attribution related to the multidimensional YM problem.

These networks often benefit from adaptations to their specific conditions by machine learning on operational data. The knowledge encoded in these adapted networks yields insights as to typical modes of operations, configurations, types of usage, etc. To utilize this knowledge for the revision and refinement of existing and future expert systems, we developed a context-sensitive machine learning process that uses a multitude of Bayesian networks as input for concept discovery. Our algorithms allow the identification of typical network fragments, their relations, and the context in which they are valid. With these results, we are able to substitute parts of existing networks that are not yet optimally adapted to their tasks and initiate a knowledge engineering process aiming at a precise network generation for future expert systems which accounts for previously unknown characteristics.

They can be extended with other features while the incremental extension process can keep higher accuracy of ML/DM than that of the immediate data mining. When the accuracy does not become higher, the above repetition stops and the feature subset at that time is taken as the input dataset of MUDM schemes. We have compared our new feature selection method with the following popular feature selection methods: filter method and wrapper method. We have done a case study, using fourteen datasets from UCI ML Repository. The case study has shown us that our method gets to or a beyond the level of two popular feature selection methods.

J	Fournier, D; Cremilleux, B				Fournier, D; Cremilleux, B			A quality index for decision tree pruning	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Engineering Intelligent Systems Conference	JUN, 2000	PAISLEY, SCOTLAND		UNIV PAISLEY	decision tree; quality; pruning; uncertain data		Decision tree is a divide and conquer classification method used in machine learning. Most pruning methods for decision trees minimize a classification error rate. In uncertain domains, some sub-trees that do not decrease the error rate can be relevant in pointing out some populations of specific interest or to give a representation of a large data file. A new pruning method (called DI pruning) is presented here. It takes into account the complexity of sub-trees and is able to keep sub-trees with leaves yielding to determine relevant decision rules, although they do not increase the classification efficiency. DI pruning allows to assess the quality of the data used for the knowledge discovery task. In practice, this method is implemented in the UnDeT software. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Throughout, the diagnosis is done using the mammographic microcalcifications. The aim of the work presented here is twofold. First, we introduce a back-end phase, based on machine learning techniques, in a previous computer aided diagnosis system. The two machine learning techniques incorporated are case-based reasoning and genetic algorithms. These algorithms look for improving the results obtained by human experts and the previous statistical model. On the other hand, we analyse the obtained results comparing them with the ones provided by other well-known machine learning techniques. The breast cancer dataset used in the experiments come from Girona Health Area. This database contains 216 images previously diagnosed by surgical biopsy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is has recently been found competitive with other state of the art machine learning techniques on benchmark data mining problems. For more general utility in this vein, however, issues are associated with the large numbers of classifiers produced by XCS; these issues concern both readability of the combined set of rules produced, and the overall processing time. The aim of this work is twofold, to produce reduced classifier sets which can more readily be understandable as rules, and to speedup processing via reduction of classifier set size during operation of XCS. A number of algorithmic modifications are presented, both in the operation of XCS itself and in the post-processing of the final set of classifiers. We describe a technique of qualifying classifiers for inclusion in action sets, which enables classifier sets to be generated prior to passing to a reduction algorithm, allowing reliable reductions to be performed with no performance penalty. The concepts of 'spoilers' and 'uncertainty' are introduced, which help to characterise some of the peculiarities of XCS in terms of operation and performance. A new reduction algorithm is described which we show to be similarly effective to Wilson's recent technique, but with considerably more favourable time complexity, and we therefore suggest that it may be preferable to Wilson's algorithm in many cases with particular requirements concerning the speed/performance tradeoff.

SMILES is a machine learning system that integrates many different features from other machine learning techniques and paradigms, and more importantly, it presents several innovations in almost all of these features, such as ensemble methods, cost-sensitive learning, and the generation of a comprehensible model from an ensemble. This paper contains a short description of the main features of the system as well as some experimental results.

This paper addresses the problem of fitting mixture densities to multivariate binned and truncated data. The EM approach proposed by McLachlan and Jones (Biometrics, 44: 2, 571-578, 1988) for the univariate case is generalized to multivariate measurements. The multivariate solution requires the evaluation of multidimensional integrals over each bin at each iteration of the EM procedure. Naive implementation of the procedure can lead to computationally inefficient results. To reduce the computational cost a number of straightforward numerical techniques are proposed. Results on simulated data indicate that the proposed methods can achieve significant computational gains with no loss in the accuracy of the final parameter estimates. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that with a sufficient number of bins and data points it is possible to estimate the true underlying density almost as well as if the data were not binned. The paper concludes with a brief description of an application of this approach to diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, in the context of binned and truncated bivariate measurements of volume and hemoglobin concentration from an individual's red blood cells.

J	Trafalis, TB; Malyscheff, AM				Trafalis, TB; Malyscheff, AM			An analytic center machine	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						support vector machines; analytic center; interior point methods		Support vector machines have recently attracted much attention in the machine learning and optimization communities for their remarkable generalization ability. The support vector machine solution corresponds to the center of the largest hypersphere inscribed in the version space. Recently, however, alternative approaches (Herbrich, Graepel, & Campbell, In Proceedings of ESANN 2000) have suggested that the generalization performance can be further enhanced by considering other possible centers of the version space like the center of gravity. However, efficient methods for calculating the center of gravity of a polyhedron are lacking. A center that can be computed efficiently using Newton's method is the analytic center of a convex polytope. We propose an algorithm, that finds the hypothesis that corresponds to the analytic center of the version space. We refer to this type of classifier as the analytic center machine (ACM). Preliminary experimental results are presented for which ACMs outperform support vector machines.

In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to modeling that combines machine learning methods with knowledge from a human domain expert. Specifically, we propose a system for automatically revising an initial model provided by an expert with an equation discovery program that is tightly constrained by domain knowledge. We apply our system to learning an improved model of a battery on the International Space Station from telemetry data. Our results suggest that this hybrid approach can reduce model development time and improve model quality.

While they usually significantly outperform domain experts (in terms of classification accuracy or otherwise), they are mostly not being used in practice. A plausible, reason for this is that it is difficult to obtain an unbiased estimation of a single classification's reliability. In the paper we propose a general transductive method for estimation of classification's reliability on single examples that is independent of the applied Machine Learning algorithm. We compare our method with existing approaches and discuss its advantages. We perform extensive testing on 14 domains and 6 Machine Learning algorithms and show that our approach can frequently yield more than 100% improvement in reliability estimation performance.

However, there has been relatively little theoretical analysis of the conditions under which the technique is effective. We analyze the robustness of collaborative recommendation: the ability to make recommendations despite (possibly intentional) noisy product ratings. We formalize robustness in machine learning terms, develop two theoretically justified models of robustness, and evaluate the models on real-world data. Our investigation is both practically relevant for enterprises wondering whether collaborative recommendation leaves their marketing operations open to attack, and theoretically interesting for the light it sheds on a comprehensive theory of collaborative recommendation.

One of the most efficient approaches to building models that axe sensitive to non-uniform costs of errors is to first estimate the class probabilities of the unseen instances and then to make the decision based on both the computed probabilities and the loss function. Although all classification algorithms can be converted into algorithms for learning models that compute class probabilities, in many cases the computed estimates have proven to be inaccurate. As a result, there is a large research effort to improve the accuracy of the estimates computed by different algorithms. This paper presents a novel approach to cost-sensitive learning that addresses the problem of minimizing the actual cost of the decisions rather than improving the overall quality of the probability estimates. The decision making step for our methods is based on the distribution of the individual scores computed by classifiers that axe built by different types of ensembles of decision trees. The new approach relies on statistics that measure the probability that the computed estimates axe on one side or the other of the decision boundary, rather than trying to improve the quality of the estimates. The experimental analysis of the new algorithms that were developed based on our approach gives new insight into cost-sensitive decision making and shows that for some tasks, the new algorithms outperform some of the best probability-based algorithms for cost-sensitive learning.

We investigate phase transitions in learning k-term DNF boolean formulae, a practically relevant class of concepts. We do not only show that, there exist phase transitions, but also characterize and locate these phase transitions using the parameters k, the number of positive and negative examples, and the number of boolean variables. Subsequently, we investigate stochastic local search (SLS) for k-term DNF learning. We compare several variants that first reduce k-term DNF to SAT and then apply well-known SLS algorithms, such as GSAT and WalkSAT. Our experiments indicate that WalkSAT is able to solve the largest fraction of hard problem instances.

Predictive clustering trees, as implemented in CLUS, allow for predicting multiple target variables. This approach makes sense especially if the target variables are not independent of each other. This is typically the case in ranking, where the (relative) performance of several approaches on the same task has to be predicted from a given description of the task. We propose to use predictive clustering trees for ranking. As compared to existing ranking approaches which are instance-based, our approach also allows for an explanation of the predicted rankings. We illustrate our approach on the task of ranking machine learning algorithms, where the (relative) performance of the learning algorithms on a dataset has to be predicted from a given dataset description.

Labeling large amount of data is a costly process which in many cases is prohibitive. In this paper we show how the use of a small number of labeled data together with a large number of unlabeled data can create high-accuracy classifiers. Our approach does not rely on any parametric assumptions about the data as it is usually the case with generative methods widely used in semi-supervised learning. We propose new discriminant algorithms handling both labeled and unlabeled data for training classification models and we analyze their performances on different information access problems ranging from text span classification for text summarization to e-mail spam detection and text classification.

In this framework the learner attempts to learn a single hidden function from a collection of examples, assumed to be drawn independently from some unknown probability distribution. However, in many cases - as in most natural language and visual processing situations - decisions depend on the outcomes of several different but mutually dependent classifiers. The classifiers' outcomes need to respect some constraints that could arise from the sequential nature of the data or other domain specific conditions, thus requiring a level of inference on top the predictions. We will describe research and present challenges related to Inference with Classifiers - a paradigm in which we address the problem of using the outcomes of several different classifiers in making coherent inferences those that respect constraints on the outcome of the classifiers. Examples will be given from the natural language domain.

This paper focuses on a machine learning approach to transfer-based MT, where data in the form of translations and lexical alignments are elicited from bilingual speakers, and a seeded version-space learning algorithm formulates and refines transfer rules. A rule-generalization lattice is defined based on LFG-style f-structures, permitting generalization operators in the search for the most general rules consistent with the elicited data. The paper presents these methods and illustrates examples.

We present a machine-learning approach to choosing between such mappings, using classifiers that, in effect, selectively expand the context for these mappings using features available in a linguistic representation of the source language input. We show that using these classifiers in our machine translation system significantly improves the quality of the translated output. Additionally, the set of distinguishing features selected by the classifiers provides insight into the relative importance of the various linguistic features in choosing the correct contextual translation.

In this paper, we present a machine vision inspection architecture, SMV(Smart Machine Vision). SMV decomposes a machine vision inspection problem into to two stages, Learning Inspection Features(LIF), and On-Line Inspection(OLI). The LIF is designed to learn visual inspection features from design data and/or from inspection products. During the OLI stage, the inspection system uses the knowledge learnt by the LIF component to inspect the visual features of products. In this paper we will present two machine vision inspection systems developed under the SW architecture for two different types of products, Printed Circuit Board(PCB) and Vacuum Florescent Displaying(VFD) boards. In the VFD board inspection system, the LIF component learns inspection features from a VFD board and its displaying patterns. In the PCB board inspection system, the LIF learns the inspection features from the CAD file of a PCB board. In both systems, the LIF component also incorporates interactive learning to make the inspection system more powerful and efficient. The VFD system has been deployed successfully in three different manufacturing companies and the PCB inspection system is the process of being deployed in an a manufacturing plant.

This paper presents new developments in the area of fault diagnosis based on intelligent software agents. The research objective was to design an agent capable of continuous real-time machine learning by using an artificial neural network known as the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC). An engine simulator that can model both normal and faulty engine operations was used to develop the learning system controller in a flexible and cost-efficient manner. This paper provides a description of the selected CMAC, a brief overview of the real-time engine simulator and its integration with the learning system as well as a few results.

Several attempts to use machine learning methods to create models of style have appeared in the literature. These models do not provide an intentional description of some musical theory but rather use statistical techniques to capture regularities that are typical of certain music experience. A standard procedure in this approach is to assume a particular model for the data sequence (such as Markov model). A major difficulty is that a choice of an appropriate model is not evident for music. In this paper, we present a universal prediction algorithm that can be applied to an arbitrary sequence regardless of its model. Operations such as improvisation or assistance to composition can be realised on the resulting representation.

The main reason for this success seems to be the synergy derived by the computational intelligent components, such as machine learning, fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms. Each of these methodologies provides hybrid systems with complementary reasoning and searching methods that allow the use of domain knowledge and empirical data to solve complex problems. In this paper, we briefly present most of those computational intelligent combinations focusing in the development of intelligent systems for the handling of problems in real-world applications. We emphasize the appropriateness of hybrid computational intelligence techniques for dealing with specific problems, we try to point particularly suitable areas of application for different combinations of intelligent techniques and we briefly state advantages and disadvantages of the "hybrid" idea, seen as the next theoretical step in the evolving impact and success of artificial intelligence tools and techniques.

Robot control code is typically full of "magic numbers" that must be painstakingly set for each environment that the robot must operate in. The idea of having a robot learn how to accomplish a task, rather than being told explicitly is an appealing one. It seems easier and much more intuitive for the programmer to specify what the robot should be doing, and to let it learn the fine details of how to do it. Ill this paper, we describe JAQL, a framework for efficient learning on mobile robots, and present the results of using it to learn control policies for some simple tasks.

Another weakness of the SVM is that it only estimates sign[p(x) - 1/2], while the probability p(x) is often of interest itself, where p(x) = P(Y = 1\X = x) is the conditional probability of a point being in class I given X = m. We propose a new approach for classification, called the import vector machine, which is built on kernel logistic regression (KLR). We show on some examples that the IVM performs as well as the SVM in binary classification. The IVM can naturally be generalized to the multi-class case. Furthermore, the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying class probabilities. Similar to the "support points" of the SVM, the IVM model uses only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions, typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM. This can give the IVM a computational advantage over the SVM, especially when the size of the training data set is large. We illustrate these techniques on some examples, and make connections with boosting, another popular machine-learning method for classification.

This paper presents a user-centred methodology for ontology construction based on the use of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. In our approach, the user selects a corpus of texts and sketches a preliminary ontology (or selects an existing one) for a domain with a preliminary vocabulary associated to the elements in the ontology (lexicalisations). Examples of sentences involving such lexicalisation (e.g. ISA relation) in the corpus are automatically retrieved by the system. Retrieved examples are validated by the user and used by an adaptive Information Extraction system to generate patterns that discover other lexicalisations of the same objects in the ontology, possibly identifying new concepts or relations. New instances are added to the existing ontology or used to tune it. This process is repeated until a satisfactory ontology is obtained. The methodology largely automates the ontology construction process and the output is an ontology with an associated trained leaner to be used for further ontology modifications.

Prognostic models based on pre-treatment characteristics, such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI), are currently used to predict outcome in DLBCL. However, clinical outcome models identify neither the molecular basis of clinical heterogeneity, nor specific therapeutic targets. We analyzed the expression of 6,817 genes in diagnostic tumor specimens from DLBCL patients who received cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy, and applied a supervised learning prediction method to identify cured versus fatal or refractory disease. The algorithm classified two categories of patients with very different five-year overall survival rates (70% versus 12%). The model also effectively delineated patients within specific IPI risk categories who were likely to be cured or to die of their disease. Genes implicated in DLBCL outcome included some that regulate responses to B-cell-receptor signaling, critical serine/threonine phosphorylation pathways and apoptosis. Our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in DLBCL and identify rational targets for intervention.

Despite of the absence of an unified theory on ensembles, there are many theoretical reasons for combining multiple learners, and an empirical evidence of the effectiveness of this approach. In this paper we present a brief overview of ensemble methods, explaining the main reasons why they are able to outperform any single classifier within the ensemble, and proposing a taxonomy based on the main ways base classifiers can be generated or combined together.

A hemiplegic participant was attached with a cuff electrode on the sural nerve connected to a telemetry controlled implanted neural amplifier, and a stimulation cuff electrode on the peroneal nerve connected to an implanted stimulator. An input domain was derived from the recorded electroneurogram (ENG) and fed to a detection algorithm based on an Adaptive Logic Network (ALN) for controlling the timing of the peroneal stimulation. The detection system was tested in real time over a period of 392 days, covering a variety of walking tasks, The detection system's ability to detect heel strike and foot lift without errors and to detect the difference between walking and standing proved to be stable for the duration of the study. We conclude that using ALNs and natural sensors provide a stable and accurate control signal for FES foot drop correction.

Many publications are focused on data driven approaches, i.e., the construction of such systems from data and applying them in areas like data mining, pattern recognition, prediction or control. In these applications, neuro-fuzzy system inevitably must be compared with other inductive methods, like neural networks, machine learning or statistical techniques. The most prominent feature that distinguishes neuro-fuzzy systems from many other techniques is their transparency and interpretability, which as assumed to be automatically "inherited" from linguistic fuzzy models. In the current literature, however, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the study of the interplay between interpretability and precision. These objectives are to a certain degree conflicting and attention must be paid to both of them. This paper addresses these issues in the context of parameter estimation in neuro-fuzzy systems identification. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

We show finite termination of a Newton method to the unique global solution starting from any point in R-n . If the function is well conditioned, then no stepsize is required from the start and if not, an Armijo stepsize is used. In either case, the algorithm finds the unique global minimum solution in a finite number of iterations.

This paper presents a parallel inductive programming (PILP) system and some recent research results in a new parallel machine learning approach that can expedite the drug design, cycle. This PILP system applies the concept of data partitioning on a loosely coupled collection of parallel inductive algorithms. One of the key design features of this system is its portability and the ease of parallelizing sequential ILP systems. The system has been tested on a Beowulf cluster and an IBM SP2 supercomputer to search for new pharmacophores for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs. A pharmacophore is the structure description of the parts of the molecules that are responsible for their biomolecular activities.

This paper reviews recent trends in the field, distinguishing four separate lines of activity: automatic scene analysis, model-based and statistical approaches to object classification, and adaptive learning from user feedback. It compares the strengths and weaknesses of model-based and adaptive techniques, and argues that further advances in the field are likely to involve the increasing use of techniques from the field of artificial intelligence.

To apply the "learning-from-data" paradigm to typhoon analysis, we built the collection of more than 34,000 well-framed typhoon images to be used for spatio-temporal data mining of typhoon cloud patterns with the aim of discovering hidden and unknown regularities contained in large image databases. In this paper, we deal with the problem of visualizing and classifying typhoon cloud patterns using kernel methods. We compare preliminary results with baseline algorithms, such as principal component analysis and a k-NN classifier, and discuss experimental results with the future direction of research.

A number of approaches have been proposed for face detection. Recently, a novel statistical machine learning method, support vector machine, has been employed. Generally, the current SVM-based methods can be divided into two categories: component-based and whole face-based. It is difficult for the component-based method to extract the small face due to no enough information for each component exists. On the other hand, the whole face-based method is too much computationally expensive to build an effective system. In this paper we present a fast system named wavelet-SVM method to extract a wide range scales of faces from grey-scale images or color images with a preprocessing using a TSL color model. The system is not only accurate and effective, but also largely speeds the system up by applying a TSL B-G color model and multiresolution wavelet decomposition.

The ontology relates the document with the database world and generates the items in the user interface, In both worlds, machine learning is applied. In the document world, a learning search engine adapts to user behavior by analysing the click-through-data. In the database world, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) bridges the gap between the fine granularity of relational databases and the coarse granularity of the ontology, KDD extracts knowledge from data and therefore allows the knowledge management system tu make good use of already existing company data. The EAMS system has been applied to customer relationship management in the insurance domain, Questions to be answered by the system concern customer acquisition (e.g., direct marketing), customer up and cross selling (e.g., which products sell well together), and customer retention (here: which customers are likely to leave the insurance company or ask for a return of a capital fife insurance). Documents about other insurance companies and demographic data published in the internet contribute to the anwers as do the results of data analysis of the company's contracts.

The goal of QSAR is to predict the bioactivities of molecules based on a set of descriptive features. QSAR problems are notoriously challenging for machine learning because a typical QSAR predictive data mining problem set is characterized by a large number of descriptive features (300-1000), often for a relatively small number of molecules (50-300). This paper introduces data strip mining for QSAR modeling.

The heuristic backpropagation learning algorithm using a divide-and-conquer method is developed to enhance learning quality in term of discovered knowledge, training error and prediction error. Simulations have shown that the fuzzy neural network tree is able to discover meaningful fuzzy rules with low training errors and low prediction errors. In the future, the fuzzy neural network tree will have more applications in large-scale data mining and data fusion, machine learning, and eBusiness.

In this work a new learning model for FNNs is proposed such that, in the linearly separable case, tends to obtain the same solution that SVMs. The key idea of the model is a weighting of the sum-of-squares error function, which is inspired in the AdaBoost algorithm. The model depends on a parameter that controls the hardness of the margin, as in SVMs, so that it can be used for the non-linearly separable case as well. In addition, it allows to deal with multiclass and multilabel problems in a natural way (as FNNs usually do), and it is not restricted to the use of kernel functions. Finally, it is independent of the concrete algorithm used to minimize tile error function. Both theoretic and experimental results are shown to confirm these ideas.

BARTMAP-S as previously described is trained in an on-line fashion, consistent with the original way intended for the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network architecture. Here we will propose an extension to BARTMAP-S for conducting off-line learning. Consequently, this alternate mode of learning will allow us to conduct structural risk minimization more directly. In this paper, we will describe the new architecture and present some empirical results to demonstrate the usefulness of structural risk minimization in learning with an ARTMAP-based neural network.

We present a novel approach, called lazy training, for reducing the overfit in multiple-layer networks. Lazy training consistently reduces generalization error of optimized neural networks by more than half on a large OCR dataset and on several real world problems from the UCI machine learning database repository. Here, lazy training is shown to be effective in a multi-layered adaptive learning system, reducing the error of an optimized backpropagation network in a speech recognition system by 50.0% on the TIDIGITS corpus.

We present a study of these architectures in the framework of structural risk minimization and computational learning theory. Fuzzy ARTMAP training uses on-line learning, has proven convergence results, and has relatively few parameters to deal with. Empirical risk minimization is employed by Fuzzy ARTMAP during its training phase. One weakness of Fuzzy ARTMAP concerns over-training on noisy training data sets or naturally overlapping training classes of data. Most of these proposed techniques attempt to address this issue, in different ways, either directly or indirectly. In this paper we will present a summary of how some of these architectures achieve success as learning algorithms.

Training of SVMs leads to either a quadratic programming (QP) problem, or a linear programming (LP) problem. This depends on the specific norm that is used when the distance between the convex hulls of two classes are computed. l(1) norm distance leads to a large scale linear programming problem in the case where the sample size is very large. We propose to apply the Benders Decomposition technique to the resulting LP for the regression case. Preliminary results show that this technique is much faster than the QP formulation.

While they often significantly outperform expert physicians (in terms of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), they are mostly not being used in practice. One reason for this is that it is difficult to obtain an unbiased estimation of diagnosis' reliability. We discuss how reliability of diagnoses is assessed in medical decision making and propose a general framework for reliability estimation in Machine Learning, based on transductive inference. We compare our approach with the usual Machine Learning probabilistic approach as well as with classical step-wise diagnostic process where the reliability of diagnosis is presented as its post-test probability The proposed transductive approach is evaluated in a practical problem of clinical diagnosis of the coronary artery disease. Significant improvements over existing techniques are achieved.

The blackboard control structure enables to explore more knowledge bases of the same syntax in parallel, the taxonomy, structures make fast zooming of attention possible and provide additional inference mechanism based on inheritance principles. In addition to these mechanisms, there is described a method utilizing machine learning approach in the process of development and refining a knowledge base. The applicability of the enhancing techniques and machine learning is documented by four case studies exploring the extended FEL-EXPERT shell in different tasks of medical decision-making. The authors consider these techniques as useful steps on the way from "classical" diagnostic expert systems towards more complex multi-agent decision tools.

We examine three potential problems with this reformulation, namely, skewed class distributions, the inclusion of "hard" training instances, and the loss of transitivity inherent in the original coreference relation. We show how these problems can be handled via intelligent sample selection and error-driven pruning of classification rule-sets. The resulting system achieves an F-measure of 69.5 and 63.4 on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference resolution data sets, respectively, surpassing the performance of the best MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference systems. In particular, the system outperforms the best-performing learning-based coreference system to date.

Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.

NB is based on the assumption of word independence in a text, which makes the computation of it far more efficient. SVMs, on the other hand, have the potential to handle large feature spaces, which makes it possible to produce better performance. The training data for SVMs are extracted using NB classifiers according to the category hierarchies, which makes it possible to reduce the amount of computation necessary for classification without sacrificing accuracy.

In particular, it is needed to determine if an earlier phase must be retried, or if the response "No Answer" must be offered. We look at an introspection task of performing a cursory evaluation of the search engine output in a QA system. We define this task as a concept-learning problem and evaluate two classifiers that use features based on score progression in the ranked list returned by the search engine and candidate answer types. Our experiments showed promising results, achieving 25% relative improvement over a majority class baseline on unseen data.

A case-based decision maker learns by storing already experienced decision problems, along with a rating of the results. Whenever a new problem needs to be solved, possible actions are assessed on the basis of experience from similar situations in which these actions have already been applied. In this paper, we consider case-based decision making within the context of instance-based learning, which is a special type of machine learning method. This consideration makes us suggest alternative case-based decision principles. These principles are motivated from a computational point of view and characterized axiomatically. Moreover, the possibility of applying case-based decision making in approximate reasoning is briefly touched on.

A major question in regards to learning fuzzy rule bases is how to handle interactions between rules of overlapping coverage. Structures, such as Yager's HPS (Hierarchical Prioritized Structure), have been proposed to answer this question. In this paper, we present our system of learning a hierarchical fuzzy rule base named FURL (for FUzzy Rule Learner). FURL takes advantage of the properties of HPS to learn hierarchical levels of fuzzy rules. FURL applies machine-learning techniques from theory revision such as credit assignment and repair to fuzzy rules. We also discuss the results of testing FURL on multiple benchmark datasets and finally discuss our results.

All these approaches were built in a very ad-hoc manner, and did not follow a systematic approach. However, we think that some kind of information system which helps in the study of how algorithms can combine to model systems in a fuzzy fashion should be very helpful. In this arcticle, we propose METALA (META-Learning Architecture), an architecture to study the typical processes of machine learning, to study the particular issue of fuzzy modeling.

The QBD system we describe learns a relation between descriptive text concerning a musical artist and their actual acoustic output, making such queries as "Play me something loud with an electronic beat" possible by merely analyzing the audio content of a database. We show a novel machine learning technique based on Regularized Least-Squares Classification (RLSC) that can quickly and efficiently learn the non-linear relation between descriptive language and audio features by treating the problem as a large number of possible output classes linked to the same set of input features. We show how the RLSC training can easily eliminate irrelevant labels.

One important step in construction of a decision tree is how to select appropriate attributes as nodes of the tree. There are many approaches to selection of attributes. In this paper, we present a new approach to selection of attributes for construction of decision tree based on rough set theory. Decision trees constructed by the presented approach tend to have simpler structure and higher classification accuracy from statistical point of view than entropy-based method under some conditions. Some data sets from UCI machine learning database repository are then used to test the two methods, which from application perspective instantiates the performance of rough set-based method. In the paper we also give an algorithm in a recursive form for construction of decision tree.

An important problem is how to reduction the complex environment in learning, so that the number of state is decreased. This paper briefly introduced Soccer Server. Then several methods of constructing the state space are analyzed. As the information received by each client has been added some noise, and the noise is increased with the increase of the correspond instance, this paper describes a new method of reduction of the state space. This method divides the environment around the client into some regions witch are not equal in size. And the state space is constructed with these regions.

Based on this consideration, a novel dada-mining method, an evolutionary strategy with immune selection and lifecycle, is designed for high level rule induction. In this novel algorithm, an immune selection operator and the crossover and mutation operators with lifecycle are employed, in which the former is used for resisting the degeneracy of original evolutionary strategy, and the latter is for adjusting the probabilities of the crossover and mutation operators more effectively. Simulations on a large database show that the above method has good validity and rationality on rule induction.

This has a long history (first described in the literature by Samuel for Checkers in 1959). More recently Sutton (1988) published the TD(lambda) algorithm which was followed by several attempts to apply it to game playing. In particular Tesauro (1992, 1994) achieved outstanding success from application to Backgammon, which resulted in world-championship class play. TD(lambda) is an algorithm that achieves computer learning of good weight sets for evaluation functions. It is based on the assumption, as for all Temporal Difference algorithms, that evaluations early in the game should predict later evaluations. Weight adjustments are made if they don't. For both Samuel's and Sutton's mechanisms, this has the undesirable effect that learning from play against an inferior opponent will distort the evaluation, and degrade play. This paper describes a way to avoid this problem, and presents results from a new Temporal Difference algorithm, TD(g), that attempts to distinguish between bad play and bad evaluations.

Annotated genomic data is also rapidly pouring into public databases. Our goal is to develop automated ways of combining these two sources of information to produce insight into the operation of cells under various conditions. Our approach is to use machine-learning techniques to identify characteristics of genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in a particular microarray experiment. We seek models that are (a) accurate, (b) easy to interpret, and (c) stable to small variations in the training data. This paper explores the effectiveness of two standard machine-learning algorithms for this task: Naive Bayes (based on probability) and PFOIL (based on building rules). Although we do not anticipate using our learned models to predict expression levels of genes, we cast the task in a predictive framework, and evaluate the quality of the models in terms of their predictive power on genes held out from the training. The paper reports on experiments using actual E. coli microarray data, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the two algorithms and demonstrating the trade-offs between accuracy, comprehensibility, and stability.

The goals of data mining methods are to achieve tasks such as data clustering, association, classification and so on. One specific task is classification rules discovery, which has drawn great attention in the data mining community during the past few years because it has been demonstrated that classification rules can contribute a lot to many real-life businesses and engineering cases. Quite a few algorithms have been proposed for finding classification rules so far, and yet most of them require multiple database scans, which increase both the I/O cost and the time consumed. To improve from the drawbacks of those methods, an efficient classification rules mining method, the weighted incidence matrix, is presented in this paper that will reduce both the number of database scans and the rules extracting time.

This paper is inspired by the observation that one can in fact achieve a 1 + epsilon ratio against the best static object in hindsight for a wide range of data structure problems via "weighted experts" techniques from Machine Learning, if computational decision-making costs are not considered. In this paper, we give two results. First, we show that for the case of lists, we can achieve a 1 + epsilon ratio with respect to the best static list in hindsight, by a simple efficient algorithm. This algorithm can then be combined with existing results to simultaneously achieve good static and dynamic bounds. Second, for trees, we show a (computationally inefficient) algorithm that achieves what we call "dynamic search optimality": dynamic optimality if we allow the online algorithm to make free rotations after each request. We hope this to be a step towards solving the longstanding open problem of achieving true dynamic optimality for trees.

It uses the XCS classifier system with a feedback function that considers area requirements and signal delays. Current results are presented and a modification of the classifier system is presented that improves its performance. The most important advantage is that the mapper discovers on its own the optimal mapping policy for the target FPGA device. The mapper has been tested on Xilinx XC4000 devices, but it can use any device given an architecture specification and a proper feedback are provided. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

The need to monitor the continuing impact of the fire on the local environment has led to the application of a number of advanced remote sensing technologies. During and after the fire, remote-sensing data was acquired from a variety of aircraft- and satellite-based sensors, including Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). We now report on the application of a machine learning technique to the automated classification of land cover using multispectral imagery. We apply a hybrid genetic programming/supervised classification technique to evolve automatic feature extraction algorithms. We use a software package we have developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, called GENIE, to carry out this evolution. We use multispectral imagery from the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument from before and after the wildfire. Using an existing land cover classification based on a Landsat 5 TM scene for our training data, we evolve algorithms that distinguish a range of land cover categories, along with clouds and cloud shadows. The details of our evolved classification are compared to the manually produced land-cover classification.

In the present paper the essential differences between the conventional and the novel approach are summarized. At the cost of the use of a simple dynamic model, a priori known, uniform, lucid, structure of reduced size, machine learning by a simple and short explicit algebraic procedure especially fit to real time applications considerable computational advantages can be achieved. The key element of the approach the Modified Renormalization Transformation supported by the application of a simple linear transformation, and the use of a simple prediction technique. It is analyzed how the satisfactory conditions of the "Complete Stability" can be guaranteed, and the convergence properties can be improved by the ancillary methods. Simulation examples are presented for the control of a 3 DOF SCARA arm by the use of Partially Stretched orthogonal transformations.

Historically, rough neurocomputing has three main threads: training set production, calculus of granules, and interval analysis. This form of neurocomputing gains its inspiration from the work of Pawlak on rough set philosophy as a basis for machine learning and from work on data mining and pattern recognition by Swiniarski and others in the early 1990s. This work has led to a variety of new rough neurocomputing computational models that are briefly presented in this article. The contribution of this article is a survey of representative approaches to rough neurocomputing.

The original data sources were small datasets and, therefore, traditional machine learning techniques were the most common tools for this tasks. As the volume of data grows these traditional methods were reviewed and extended with the knowledge from experts working on the field of data management and databases. Today problems are even bigger than before and, once again, a new discipline allows the researchers to scale up to these data. This new discipline is distributed and parallel processing. In order to use parallel processing techniques, specific factors about the mining algorithms and the data should be considered. Nowadays, there are several new parallel algorithms, that in most of the cases are extensions of a traditional centralized algorithm. Many of these algorithms have common core parts and only differ on distribution schema, parallel coordination or load/task balancing methods. We call these groups algorithm families. On this paper we introduce a methodology to implement algorithm families. This methodology is founded on the MOIRAE distributed control architecture.

Intelligent Web agents offer a potential solution to meet such challenges. A Web agent collects information, discovers knowledge through Web mining and users' behavior analysis, and applies the discovered knowledge to give dynamically recommendations to Website users, to update Web pages, and to provide suggestions to Website designers. The basic functionalities and components of an intelligent Web agent are discussed. A prototype system, called PagePrompter, is described. The knowledge of the system is extracted based on a combination of Web usage mining and machine learning.

The schema's structure and the way classifiers on a higher level are synthesized from those on lower levels are subject to an adaptive iterative process that allows to learn from the input training data. Detailed algorithms and classifiers based on similarity and dissimilarity measures are presented.

The paper describes a method for improving accuracy of rules generated by inductive machine learning algorithm by generating the ensemble of classifiers. It generates multiple classifiers using the CLIP4 algorithm and combines them using a voting scheme. The generation of a set of different classifiers is performed by injecting controlled randomness into the learning algorithm, but without modifying the training data set. Our method is based on the characteristic properties of the CLIP4 algorithm. The case study of the SPECT heart image analysis system is used as an example where improving accuracy is very important. Benchmarking results on other well-known machine teaming datasets, and comparison with an algorithm that uses boosting technique to improve its accuracy are also presented. The proposed method always improves the accuracy of the results when compared with the accuracy of a single classifier generated by the CLIP4 algorithm, as opposed to using boosting. The obtained results are comparable with other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

In contrast to existing algorithms that claim to be incremental, INC-DT uses only a fixed amount of memory during the whole learning process. It bases its hypotheses exclusively on the last one computed, its assessment, and a fixed number of seen examples. So, it is able to deal with initial knowledge and concept drift, e.g.	Tech Univ Darmstadt, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany	Grieser, G (reprint author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Alexanderstr 10, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.							0	0	0	I O S PRESS	AMSTERDAM	NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0922-6389	1-58603-259-3	FR ART INT			2002	78						105	106				2	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BV48D	WOS:000179109100013

The difficulty of this task depends on characteristics of the particular language. One of the characteristics of the Slovenian language is that lexical stress can be located almost arbitrarily on every syllable in the word, which makes the pronunciation very difficult. Some pronunciation rules exist, but their precision is not sufficient for efficient speech synthesis. Therefore a machine-learning technique (decision trees) was applied in order to achieve better results. The MULTEXT-East Slovene Lexicon was used for data sets, which was supplemented with lexical stress marks. The accuracy achieved by decision trees significantly outperforms all previous results. However, the sizes of the trees indicate that the accentuation in the Slovenian language is a very complex problem and a simple solution in the form of relatively simple rules is not possible.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to learn models that will assign images to classes, but most machine learning algorithms cannot work with images directly. Therefore, we need to introduce a representation of images that typical learning algorithms can use. We propose two image representation methods based on texture segmentation. In the region clustering approach, segmentation is applied to all images in the training set. The descriptions of the resulting regions are then clustered, and images are represented by sparse vectors where each component indicates whether, and to what extent, regions from a particular cluster are present in the image. Algorithms such as Support Vector Machines can then be used to train on the resulting vectors. Alternatively, a similarity measure between segmented images may be taken as a starting point and converted into a generalized kernel for use with Support Vector Machines.

This approach is particularly effective when creating content for the new generation of autostereoscopic displays that require multiple stereo images. The dominant technique for such content conversion is to develop a depth map for each frame of 2D material. The use of a depth map as part of the 2D to 3D conversion process has a number of desirable characteristics: 1. The resolution of the depth map may be lower than that of the associated 2D image; 2. It can be highly compressed; 3. 2D compatibility is maintained; and 4. Real time generation of stereo, or multiple stereo pairs, is possible. The main disadvantage has been the laborious nature of the manual conversion techniques used to create depth maps from existing 2D images, which results in a slow and costly process. An alternative, highly productive technique has been developed based upon the use of Machine Leaning Algorithms (MLAs). This paper describes the application of MLAs to the generation of depth maps and presents the results of the commercial application of this approach.

Over the last decade this theory played a crucial role in the construction of probabilistically checkable proofs and the derivation of hardness of approximation results. Applications in areas like computer vision, machine learning, and self-correcting programs were also established. In the self-testing problem one is interested in determining (maybe probabilistically) whether a function to which one has oracle access satisfies a given property. We consider the problem of testing algebraic functions and survey over a decade of research in the area. Special emphasis is given to illustrate the scenario where the problem takes place and to the main techniques used in the analysis of tests. A novel aspect of this work is the separation it advocates between the mathematical and algorithmic issues that arise in the theory of self-testing.

Such inconsistencies can be the result of modeling errors or recent modifications of the system. Despite such discrepancies we can still attempt to perform automatic verification. In fact, as we show, we can sometimes exploit the verification results to assist in automatically learning the required updates to the model. In a related previous work, we have suggested the idea of black box checking, where verification starts without any model, and the model is obtained while repeated verification attempts are performed. Under the current assumptions, an existing inaccurate (but not completely obsolete) model is used to expedite the updates. We use techniques from black box testing and machine learning. We present an implementation of the proposed methodology called AMC (for Adaptive Model Checking). We discuss some experimental results, comparing various tactics of updating a model while trying to perform model checking.

These approaches are increasingly being applied to traffic and transportation problems formerly reserved for formal statistical approaches such as discrete choice models. Part of the reason for this has to do with research trends, but there are some potential advantages associated with such techniques, including the ability to model nonlinear systems; the ease with which symbolic, nominal, or categorical variables can be included; and the ability of these methods to deal with noisy data. The use of two modeling techniques, the nested logit model and the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, was investigated in terms of their applicability to the household vehicle choice problem. Both methods generated strong results, although the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network yielded better predictive potential.

The revolution in DNA microarray technologies and the imminent emergence of its analogue for proteins, along with machine learning algorithms, promise rapid acceleration in the identification of potential drug targets, and in high-throughput screens for subpopulation-specific toxicity. Similarly, advances in structural genomics in conjunction with in vitro and in silico evolutionary methods will rapidly accelerate the number of lead drug candidates and substantially augment their target specificity. Taken collectively, these advances will usher in an era of predictive medicine, which will move medical practice from reactive therapy after disease onset, to proactive prevention.

However, for a given data set, it is often not clear beforehand which machine learning method will yield the best prediction performance. This study compares the variable selection and prediction performance of four machine-learning methods of different complexity: logistic regression, decision tree, multivariate adaptive regression splines and neural network. The methods are applied to the task of predicting the exceedance of the European PM10 daily average objective of 50 mug m(-3) for a station in Helsinki, Finland. Our study shows that some predictors were selected by all models but that the different models also picked different variables. The performance of three of the four methods investigated was very similar, however, performance of the decision tree method was significantly inferior. Performance was sensitive to the learning sample size and time period used.

This paper presents the design and evaluation of an adaptive version of TOOT, a spoken dialogue system for retrieving online train schedules. Based on rules learned from a set of training dialogues, adaptive TOOT constructs a user model representing whether the user is having speech recognition problems as a particular dialogue progresses. Adaptive TOOT then automatically adapts its dialogue strategies based on this dynamically changing user model. An empirical evaluation of the system demonstrates the utility of the approach.

Here we report on the development of SkyDOT (Sky Database for Objects in the Time domain), a new Virtual Observatory, which is dedicated to the study of sky variability. The site will confederate a number of massive variability surveys and enable exploration of the time domain in astronomy. We discuss the architecture of the database and the functionality of the user interface. An important aspect of SkyDOT is that it is continuously updated in near real time so that users can access new observations in a timely manner. The site will also utilize high level machine learning tools that will allow sophisticated mining of the archive.

A population of trees is evolved by employing the genetic operators and every individual is evaluated by using a fitness function based on the J-measure. The method is able to deal with large data sets since it uses a parallel implementation of genetic programming through the grid model. Experiments on data sets from the UCI machine learning repository show better results with respect to C5. Furthermore, performance results show a nearly linear speedup.

IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ				Adaptive systems are systems whose function evolves while adapting to current environmental conditions. Due to the real-time adaptation, newly learned data have a significant impact on system behavior When online adaptation is included in system control, anomalies could cause abrupt loss of system functionality and possibly result in a failure. In this paper we present a framework for reasoning about the online adaptation problem. We describe a machine learning tool that sniffs data and detects anomalies before they are passed to the adaptive components for learning. Anomaly detection is based on distance computation. An algorithm for framework evaluation as well as sample implementation and empirical results are discussed The method we propose is simple and reasonably effective, thus it can be easily adopted for testing.

Machine learning algorithms have proven to be of great practical value in a variety of application domains. Not surprisingly, the field of software engineering turns out to be a fertile ground where many software development and maintenance tasks could be formulated as learning problems and approached in terms of learning algorithms. This paper deals with the subject of applying machine learning methods to software engineering. In the paper, we first provide the characteristics and applicability of some frequently utilized machine learning algorithms. We then summarize and analyze the existing work and discuss some general issues in this niche area. Finally we offer some guidelines on applying machine learning methods to software engineering tasks.

In the 21st century, the problem no longer lies in writing the learner, but in choosing which learners to run on a given data set. In this paper, we argue that the final choice of learners should not be exclusive; in fact, there are distinct advantages in running data sets through multiple learners. To illustrate our point, we perform a case study on a reuse data set using three different styles of learners: association rule, decision tree induction, and treatment Software reuse is a topic of avid debate in the professional and academic arena; it has proven that it can be both a blessing and a curse. Although there is much debate over where and when reuse should be instituted into a project, our learners found some procedures which should significantly improve the odds of a reuse program succeeding.

IEEE Comp Soc, Informat Technol Res Inst, Wright State Univ				We address the problem of automatic maintenance of Web wrappers used in data integration systems to encapsulate an access to Web information providers. The maintenance of Web wrappers is critical as providers often changes the page format and/or structure making wrappers inoperable. The solution we propose extends the conventional wrapper architecture with a novel component of automatic maintenance and recovery. We consider the automatic recovery as special type of the classification problem and use ensemble methods of machine learning to build alternative views of provider pages. We combine extraction rules of conventional wrappers with content features of extracted information to accurate recovery from three types of format changes, namely, content, context and structural changes.

We describe a way of selecting all combinations of relevant, irredundant features of training examples, and possible ways to identify a relevant, irredundant features combination of the target concept. We also propose a new example selection method which is based on the filtering of the so called pattern frequency domain and which resembles frequency domain filtering in signal and image processing. The empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed selection methods for relevant features and examples.

The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of hand-printed Arabic characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over the large degree of variation between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example. The system was tested on a sample of handwritten characters from several individuals whose writing ranged from acceptable to poor in quality and the correct average recognition rate obtained using cross-validation was 87.23%.

Researchers have used ANOVA to determine if the results from such analysis are statistically significant. Yet, in the medical decision making community, the prevailing method is LABMRMC. Although this latter method uses ANOVA, before doing so, it applies the Jackknife method to account for case-sample variance. To determine whether these two tests make the same decisions regarding statistical significance, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation using several problems derived from Gaussian distributions, three machine-learning algorithms, ROC analysis, ANOVA, and LABMRMC. Results suggest that the decisions these tests make are not the same, even for simple problems. Furthermore, the larger issue is that since ANOVA does not account for case-sample variance, one cannot generalize experimental results to the population from which the data were drawn.

By taking advantage of the plethora in unlabeled data found in image databases in addition to some available labeled examples, we overcome the expensive task of annotating the whole set of training data and the performance of the character segmentation learner is increased. Apart ftom this approach, which has not previously used for this task, we have experimented with two well-known machine learning methods (Learning Vector Quantization and a simplified version of the Transformation-Based Learning theory). We argue that a classifier generated from BBN and SVM is well suited for learning to identify the correct segment boundaries. Empirical results will support this claim. Performance has been methodically evaluated using both English and Modern Greek corpora in order to determine the unbiased behavior of the trained models. Limited training data are proved to endow with satisfactory results. We have been able to achieve precision exceeding 87.5%.

Data cleaning problems are frequently encountered in many research areas, such as knowledge discovery in databases, data warehousing, system integration and e-services. The process of identifying the record pairs that represent the same entity (duplicate records), commonly known as record linkage, is one of the essential elements of data cleaning. In this paper, we address the record linkage problem by adopting a machine learning approach. Three models are proposed and are analyzed empirically. Since no existing model, including those proposed in this paper, has been proved to be superior, we have developed an interactive Record Linkage Toolbox named TAILOR. Users of TAILOR can build their own record linkage models by tuning system parameters and by plugging in in-house developed and public domain tools. The? proposed toolbox serves as a framework for the record linkage process, and is designed in an extensible way to interface with existing and future record linkage model! We have conducted an extensive experimental study to evaluate our proposed models using not only synthetic but also real data. Results show that the proposed machine learning record linkage models outperform the existing ones both in accuracy, and in performance.

We describe SORCER, a second-order table compression learning system and compares its results with those obtained from a well-established decision tree learner, C4.5. On the average of ten 10-fold cross validations, SORCER obtained a slightly lower error rate than C4.5. We discuss the implication of these results.

The ultimate task, being undertaken in the context of a Chinese-English machine translation project, will be to develop a language-neutral method to discover similar documents from multilingual text collections. Using a variation of automatic clustering techniques, which apply a neural net approach namely the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), we have conducted several experiments to uncover associated documents based on Chinese-English bilingual parallel corpora, and a hybrid Chinese-English corpus. The experiments show some interesting results and a couple of potential ways for future work towards the field of multilingual information discovery. Besides, for exploring the impacts on linguistics issues with the machine learning approach to mining sensible linguistics elements from multilingual texts, we have examined the resulting term associations and text associations from the view of cross-lingual text similarity. To evaluate semantic relatedness of the mined bilingual texts, we applied a measure technique of semantic similarity in the resulting bilingual document clusters and word clusters. This paper presents algorithms that enable multilingual text mining based on the serf-organizing map (SCM) for automatically grouping similar multilingual texts (i.e. Chinese and English texts), along with a means in measuring their semantic similarity to resolve the difficulties of syntactic and semantic ambiguity in multilingual information access.

However, HTRP has some limitations: the sentences must be broken into verb-noun pairs to be presented to the network. This makes it impossible for the system to deal with instances in which constraints are operative not only between the verb and one of its arguments (nouns), but also between two arguments of the same verb. Another possible drawback is training with negative examples (semantically unsound sentences). Although many researchers point out that negative inputs are necessary for a system to learn a grammar, several authors believe that, under certain circumstances, a network is able to learn in absence of negative examples. From a psycholinguistic standpoint, especially regarding language acquisition, explicit negative evidence is hardly to be expected as part of the cognitive environment. In this paper, new versions of HTRP are proposed (HTRP 11) to account for the whole sentence as input with no negative examples provided during training.

However, despite its wide acceptance and recognition [6], biasing has never been studied as a separate research issue, except in [4] where an attempt is made to shed light on the relationship between the quality of bias and learning trials. So far, the general view held in biasing a learning system is to look for a bias that maximally collapse the search space [6, 8]. It is well known, however, that reckless reduction of the search space often leads to a sub-optimal learning [2]. Regardless of the final level of optimality, the paper challenges this broadily accepted biasing scheme from the point of view of accelerating the learning process itself. Is a large search space a definitive indication of slow learning? We will give a non-affirmative answer to this dogma by presenting a typical robot learning scenario. Experiments clearly indicate a bias that is derived from the unique characterstic of the task shows, inspite of its large search space, a better learning behavior than a bias that reduces the search space aggressively.

The algorithm works by finding the best performing quantization complexity of the feature vectors, and this makes it necessary to discretize all continuous valued features. Therefore, results are given by showing the initial quantization of the continuous valued features that yields best performance. Further, the Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm is also compared to a conventional linear classifier, which does not discretize any feature values. In general, the Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm outperforms the linear classifier by obtaining a lower probability of error, as averaged over all thirty data sets.

In this paper, we propose an approach combining statistical and rule-based techniques. The proposed approach discovers candidates from Chinese texts based upon the probability of a character being a part of a Chinese place name; and confirms or eliminates the candidates by applying rules obtained by human summarization and transformation-based machine learning. In this approach, we employ a statistical measure: weight of likelihood (WOL), to estimate the likelihood of a character being a part of a Chinese place name in real corpora. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that the proposed measure WOL is used to capture the capability of a character forming Chinese places names in real corpora. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real data set and the recall and precision are 97% and 90.92% respectively.

A small scale experiment is conducted leading to the compilation of an evaluation corpus for the Greek language. Two models of sentence extraction are then described, along the lines of shallow linguistic analysis, feature combination and machine learning. Both models are based on term extraction and statistical filtering. After extracting the individual features of the text, we apply them to two neural networks that classify each sentence depending on its feature vector, the term weight being the feature with the best discriminant capacity. A three-layer feedforward network trained with the highly popular backpropagation algorithm and a competitive learning self-organizing reap characterized by the formation of a topographic map, both trained on a small manually annotated corpus of summaries, perform the sentence extraction task. Both methods could be used for rapid light information retrieval-oriented summarization.

Here we present a multi-strategy signal pattern classifier MSPC that can differentiate among large numbers of signal pattern classes with low classification cost. MSPC combines decision tree concepts, fuzzy rules, genetic algorithms and neural networks to achieve its goal. This combination provides powerful classification capabilities with great tuning flexibility for either performance or cost-efficiency. Fuzzy rules measure similarities between signal patterns. A genetic algorithm finds the best fuzzy classification rule. Neural networks are used in the final classification step and in noise elimination. Machine learning concepts are applied to set the overall algorithm parameters.

A NP that also controls the elbow joint movements. could benefit even more to some hemiplegic subjects. NP users require effective automatic control and a practical command interface. The control that we developed was based on the following hypotheses: once the task-and preferred strategy for movement are selected, them by using mal the voluntary (natural) control that drives the proximal (shoulder joint), the synergistic (artificial) control segment drives distal segment (elbow joint). Literature suggests, and we confirmed in experiments that reproducible synergies between the shoulder and - elbow joint movement exist. Here, we describe a method for determining synergies between joints' movement while reaching by applying inductive learning (IL) technique. This method relies on the hierarchical mutual information classifier algorithm [1]. The synergy is a map obtained by IL between the flexion/extension (FIE) angular velocities at the shoulder and elbow-joints. Two other shoulder joint rotations (abduction/adduction and humeral rotation) are independent from the FIE synergy; thus, the results of this study are applicable to the general three-dimensional (3D) movement. The IL uses for learning data collected from able-bodied subjects. The correlation coefficient (K) and the timing-error (t(er)) between the learned and recorded-trajectories were the measures of the generalization; the boundaries for deciding that learning was accomplished were selected at K > 99 percent and t(er) = 0.

These trees can be seen as an extension to the machine learning decision trees concept, where the predicates here can be complex expressions rather than just simple attribute-value comparisons. In order to improve the search ability and to produce meaningful results, type-constraints are applied to the genetic programming procedure, expressed in a BNF grammar. The model is tested in two well-known domains. In the Balance-Scale data, the system achieves in revealing the data creation rule. In the E-Coli Protein Localization Sites data, the system realizes a competitive to the literature classification score, retaining the solution comprehensibility. The training procedure is guided by an adaptive fitness measure. The overall performance of this system denotes its competitiveness to standard computational intelligent procedures.

Within a Text-to-Speech (TTS) application this task has to be handled while adapting a system to a new language or a new speaker. In this paper a parameterized data-driven weight decay [1] is presented and applied in order to systematically analyze phonetic and linguistic input features of a neural network (NN). The NN models an acoustic prosody generation module of our TTS system Papageno. The original NN is enhanced by an additional preprocessing unit. The input features are propagated by a diagonal matrix to a preprocessing cluster. This diagonal matrix is the only one which utilizes the weight decay technique. So the elements of this matrix describe a weighing of the input features. The application resulted in an evaluation of input parameters and a strong reduction of input features without performance loss. Within our f0-contour generation module the squared error of the NN is remarkably reduced.

The basic idea is to replace uncertain words in the transcriptions with a phoneme recognition result that is post-processed using a phoneme-to-grapheme converter. This converter turns phoneme strings into grapheme strings and is trained using machine learning techniques. Recently, the system was enhanced by adding a spelling checker to it. Experiments show that, even when the grapheme strings are not fully correct, the resulting transcriptions are more easily readable than the original ones.

The method combines concepts from Markovian dynamics, large margin classifiers and reproducing kernels for robust sequence detection by learning inter-data dependencies, A MAP (maximum a posteriori) sequence estimator is obtained by regressing transition probabilities between symbols as a function of received data. The training procedure involves maximizing a lower bound of a regularized cross-entropy on the posterior probabilities, which simplifies into direct estimation of transition probabilities using kernel logistic regression. Applied to channel equalization, forward decoding kernel machines outperform support vector machines and other techniques by about 5dB in SNR for given BER, within I dB of theoretical limits.

In this paper we argue that pruning should be reduced to a minimum and that the availability of a large rule base may improve the precision of the classifier without affecting its performance. In L(3) (Live and Let Live), a new algorithm for associative classification, a lazy pruning technique iteratively discards all rules that only yield wrong case classifications. Classification is performed in two steps. Initially, rules which have already correctly classified at least one training case, sorted by confidence, are considered. If the case is still unclassified, the remaining rules (unused during the training phase) are considered, again sorted by confidence. Extensive experiments on 26 databases from the UCI machine learning database repository show that L(3) improves the classification precision with respect to previous approaches.

Typical machine learning algorithms for this problem require two classes of data for training: positive and negative training examples. However, in application to Web page classification, gathering an unbiased sample of negative examples appears to be difficult. We propose a heterogeneous learning framework for classifying Web pages, which (1) eliminates the need for negative training data, and (2) increases classification accuracy by using two heterogeneous learners. Our framework uses two heterogeneous learners - a decision list and a linear separator which complement each other - to eliminate the need for negative training data in the training phase and to increase the accuracy in the testing phase. Our results show that our heterogeneous framework achieves high accuracy without requiring negative training data; it enhances the accuracy of linear separators by reducing the errors on "low-margin data". That is, it classifies more accurately while requiring less human efforts in training.

This paper proposes the ESRS algorithm, based on extended similarity-based rough set theory, which selects a reasonable number of the representative cases while maintaining satisfactory classification accuracy. It also can handle noise and inconsistent data. Experimental results on synthetic and real sets of cases showed that its predictive accuracy is similar to that of well-known machine learning systems on standard data sets, while it has the advantage of being applicable to any data set where a similarity function can be defined.

Two different approaches have been used to solve this problem: conceptual clustering in machine learning and clustering visualization in statistics and graphics. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the benefits of combining clustering visualization and conceptual clustering to obtain better cluster interpretations. In our research we have combined concept trees for conceptual clustering with shaded similarity matrices for visualization. Experimentation shows that the two interpretation approaches can complement each other to help us understand data better.

They have been applied successfully to a wide range of problem domains, from protein structure prediction to satellite fault diagnosis. However their execution can be computationally demanding. We introduce a scalable FPGA-based architecture for executing inductive logic programs, such that the execution speed largely increases linearly with respect to the number of processors. The architecture contains multiple processors derived from Warren's Abstract Machine, which has been optimised for hardware implementation using techniques such as instruction grouping and speculative assignment. The effectiveness of the architecture is demonstrated using the mutagenesis data set containing 12000 facts of chemical compounds.

In this system the entire control task is shared between the autonomous module and the human operator. the robot itself maintains local balancing, while the operator is responsible for the global navigation. The autonomous module consists of two unique and essential behaviors: lateral balancing and fall recovery. These behaviors are modeled by a machine learning algorithm. We developed a method enabling the system to make a reasonable decision in shared control, and addressed the implementation issues in this paper. Experiments demonstrated that this shared control scheme provides an efficient way to control a dynamically stable system, such as Gyrover.

Specifying the low-level mapping from sensors to actuators is prone to programmer misconceptions, and debugging such a mapping can be tedious. The idea of having a robot learn how to accomplish a task, rather than being told explicitly is an appealing one. It seems easier and much more intuitive for the programmer to specify what the robot should be doing, and to let it learn the fine details of how to do it. In this paper, we introduce a framework for reinforcement learning on mobile robots and describe our experiments using it to learn simple tasks.

In this work we Propose for the first time the use of support vector machine (SVM) learning for automated detection of MCs in digitized mammograms. In the proposed framework, MC detection is formulated as a supervised-learning problem and the method of SVM is employed to develop the detection algorithm. The proposed method is developed and evaluated using a database of 76 mammograms containing 1120 MCs. To evaluate detection performance, free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves are used. Experimental results demonstrate that, when compared to several other existing methods, the proposed SVM framework offers the best performance.

Multifunction microprocessor-based protection relays and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) have created new opportunities for the measurement of power system signals and their diagnosis. The quantity and complexities of the information has been enhanced to the extent that it is well beyond what is required for the immediate operational issues. A significant amount of data is now continually available and during a serious operational incident or fault, it may become excessive and impossible for a substation operator to handle. A technique used to extract concise information from the data received from microprocessor-based relays will be described in this paper. The data analysis technique is based on Rough Set Theory, which has already been used in many areas of artificial intelligence including machine learning and knowledge-based system. A 33/11kV distribution network was modeled under different types of fault scenarios using EMTDC. The resulting event database was uploaded into the Rough Set Data Analysis Module (RSDAM), which eliminates superfluous data whilst keeping all the essential information.

However, in practice, databases are rarely complete. This affects their real world data mining applications. This paper investigates the methods for learning four types well-known Bayesian network classifiers from incomplete databases. These four types BN classifiers are Naive-Bayes, Tree augmented Naive-Bayes, BN augmented Naive-Bayes, and general BN, where the latter two are learned using dependency analysis based algorithms that work only on the Database Completeness assumption. In order to enable this kind algorithims to handle with missing data, this paper introduces a novel deterministic method to estimate the (Conditional) Mutual Information from incomplete databases, which can be used to do CI tests, a fundamental step in the dependency analysis based algorithms.

This paper shows the structure and design of the whole platform, the specific implementation of basic modules on the educational platform. The platform is divided into three parts: low-level module, libraries, and program scheme. Students should work in the program scheme part, build the basic skill and top-level strategy layer. This paper describes the main theory of the basic skills such as dribble, kick, and shoot, including the distributed planning in realizing these skills. The top-level strategy part analyzes realization of several basic strategies and machine learning's impact on the game. We also provide the method and framework about implementing the basic skills and top-level strategy referred to the qsinghuAeolus program. At the end of this paper, we show the educational value of the platform in RoboCup simulation games.

In this paper, we present a multisplitting algorithm, RCAT, for continuous attributes based on statistic information. When calculating information gain for a continuous attribute, it splits the value range of the attribute into some initial intervals at first; secondly it computes the probability estimation of every class at each interval, and finds the best threshold in the probability space; thirdly this threshold separates the initial intervals into two sets, combines adjacent intervals in the same set, then optimizes the boundary of every combined interval, and gets the information gain of the continuous attribute in the end. We also provide a pruning method to simplify the decision trees; empirical results show that RCAT algorithm can get decision trees with much higher intelligibility than C4.5 while retaining their accuracy.

At first, the Learning Vector Quantization is used to build several classifiers based on the low-level features, such as color histogram, region shape, texture and etc., which are extracted from the images. The best classifier performs a recognition ratio of 81.3%, so the Adaboost learning method is applied to combine these classifiers to form a stronger one, and the final classification achieves 9 result of 86.0% on the test set. Adaboost's ability in multi-feature analysis is emphasized, and the proposed algorithm is important both for the blue-picture-filter in the www and for the semantic image indexing in the Content-based Image Retrieval. In the experiments, the groundtruth is made of 1,200 images; meanwhile the test set is independent from the train set.

In conventional machine learning, a lot of research has been focused on a specific method for a specific environment in which models are selected and built generally by using ad hoc methods, "trial and error" or solely on "expert" knowledge or intuition. As a result, the effectiveness of the models is limited and the research results often do not contribute to the fundamental understanding of the field nor lend themselves to the broader problem domain. This paper aims to provide theoretical foundations as well as useful tools to guide model building and to explain and evaluate model performance by using several information-theoretic measures, namely, entropy, conditional entropy, relative entropy, information gain, and information cost. These measures can characterize the regularity of data set and thus contribute to the data modeling.

The key of this kind of system is machine learning that fits system for specific user. In this paper, an effective approach of machine learning of Chinese Pinyin-to-character conversion for small-memory application is presented. The approach is based on iterative new word identification and word frequency increasing that results in more accurate segmentation of Chinese character gradually and satisfy the need of user finally. Applying proposed machine learning to Chinese character input system through keyboard improves accuracy of Pinyin-to-character conversion from 90% up to 98%. Such a system can run in very small memory (limited in 120K) and satisfy the need of small-memory platform. With rapid development of digital appliances such as PDA, mobile telephone, intelligent refrigerator and etc., and with development of embedded operating system, Pinyin-to-character conversion presented in this paper has found its new application.

This paper presents a multilingual NLIDB model based on case, which is motivated by the idea of case-based reasoning in machine learning.. The model avoids the. difficulties of constructing parsers for all intended supporting natural languages by storing every query pattern and its solution as a case into a casebase. Query sentence inputted by user is, syntactically compared to cases in the casebase and the solution of the most similar case is reused to query the database. Each case,is represented as a XML document fragment and the casebase is a valid XML document. All the facilities provided by XML greatly enhanced the maintainability and scalability of the model. The model has been implemented in a multilingual NLIDB for a stock market information retrieval system.

Viewed from computation, AIS is powerful at learning and recognition; hence, a novel paradigm for machine learning and pattern recognition forms. Engineering creative design can be viewed as constraint satisfaction problems, which is NP-hard in essence, thereby it is generally hard for classical methods to solve. Since AIS has great potentials in solving hard and complex problems, it motivates the authors to explore the field of creative mechanism pattern synthesis, one of the most challenging fields in engineering creative design, with AIS. Specially, an engineering framework of AIS based pattern classification and matching is proposed, and the preliminary experiment results show the validity of the proposed method.

Fuzzy decision tree is popular in dealing with the ambiguity and vagueness associated with human thinking. The generalization capability of decision tree, which is also called the predictive capability, is one of the most important indexes to judge whether a decision tree generation algorithm is good. The stronger the generalization is, the higher the prediction accuracy is. In practical applications, the generalization capability of decision tree algorithm directly affects the accuracy of decision-making. However, so far, nobody gives a comparison study between the generalization capabilities of fuzzy and crisp decision tree algorithms. This paper makes an attempt to compare the generalization capability of fuzzy and crisp decision trees in three aspects. It aims to provide some useful guidelines for selecting either a crisp or a fuzzy algorithm while decision tree induction is applicable to real problems.

Because Chinese is not a segmented language, the words, in a sentence must be segmented before they are processed by consequent Chinese named entity recognition component. Similarly, POS tagging is also an important, fundamental task for Chinese named entity recognition. In order to enhance the quality of word segmentation and POS tagging, it is necessary to explore different approaches for improving the performance. One of the approaches is to repair errors as much as possible, if word segmentation and POS tagging tool is available on hand. This paper aims at introducing an effective error repairer using transformation based error-driven machine, learning technique. It deals with detecting error positions,, producing error repairing rules, selecting higher-score rules, ordering rules and distinguishing rule usage conditions, etc.. The experimental results show that word segmentation and POS tagging errors are significantly reduced and the performance has been improved. The average recall for word segmentation and POS tagging has gone up, by 4.01% and 11.98% respectively; while the average precision for word segmentation and POS tagging has gone up by 6.07% and 13.02% respectively. At the same time, another experimental result has also shown that, the average F-measure for the recognition of six Chinese named entities has also increased by 14.04%([8]).

While there seems to be a race for accuracy, very little has been done to understand and solve the issues related to atypical data. In this paper, coverage-performance (CP) curves are introduced to help a better understanding of atypical data. The concept of CP curves is based on the idea of separating atypical data and visualizing performance of classification as a function of coverage (the fraction of data participating in training or evaluation). To generate CP curves, two schemes are compared in this paper. The first scheme is based on SVMs alone and the second one is a hybrid of a PNN and a SVM. Two generated datasets with overlapping features are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of CP curves obtained by each scheme. Calculated theoretical limits on the generated data show that the hybrid scheme is a very effective way of producing CP curves. It is also shown that by separating atypical data, although we lose some data, the performance of the classification increases significantly.

The common theine among the proposed techniques is a selection mechanism that chooses a prediction from among several component predictors. We make the observation that singling out one particular component predictor ignores the information of the non-selected components. We propose Branch Prediction Fusion, originally, inspired by work in the machine learning field, which combines or fuses the information from all of the components to arrive at a final prediction. Our 32KB predictor achieves the same overall prediction accuracy as the 188KB versions of the previous best performing predictors (the Multi-Hybrid and the global-local perceptron).

Support Vector Machine (SVM) as one of the methods in machine learning to make use of kernel is first discussed with the intention of applying it to handwriting recognition. SVM work by mapping training data for a classification task into a higher dimensional feature space using kernel function and then find a maximal margin hyper plane, which separates the mapped data. Finding the solution hyper plane involves using quadratic programming which is computationally intensive. The algorithms for practical implementation like Sequential Minimization Optimization (SMO) and its improvements are discussed. A few simpler methods similar to SVM but requires simpler computation are also mentioned for comparison. Usage of SVM for handwriting recognition is then proposed.

In all cases the evolved strategies result in more numerous resource locations than a pure, non-adaptive peer-to-peer protocol such as the Gnutella protocol. The resulting evolved strategies are described, and empirical validation of the Gnutella protocol is given via both its creation through machine-learning techniques, and through the analysis of real-world constants used in the protocol.

These methods are applied to discover meaningful knowledge from large databases, which shows they, are useful. However since there has been no formal approach proposed to treat these methods, efficiency, of each method is only, compared empirically. In this paper, we introduce matroid theory, and rough sets to construct a common framework for empirical machine learning methods which induce the combination of attribute-value pairs from databases. Combination of the concepts of rough sets and matroid theory gives us an excellent set-theoretical framework and enables its to understand the differences and the similarities between these methods from the viewpoint of partitions of the universe.

We cast the problem of learning the contexts for the linguistic operations as classification tasks, and apply straightforward machine learning techniques, such as decision tree learning. The training data consist of linguistic features extracted from syntactic and semantic representations produced by a linguistic analysis system. The target features are extracted from links to surface syntax trees. Our evidence consists of four examples from the German sentence realization system code-named Amalgam: case assignment, assignment of verb position features, extraposition, and syntactic aggregation.

Bilingual Bootstrapping makes use of, in learning, a small number of classified data and a large number of unclassified data in the source and the target languages in translation. It constructs classifiers in the two languages in parallel and repeatedly boosts the performances of the classifiers by further classifying data in each of the two languages and by exchanging between the two languages information regarding the classified data. Experimental results indicate that word translation disambiguation based on Bilingual Bootstrapping consistently and significantly outperforms the existing methods based on 'Monolingual Bootstrapping'.

Through the HMM, our system is able to apply and integrate four types of internal and external evidences: 1) simple deterministic internal feature of the words, such as capitalization and digitalization; 2) internal semantic feature of important triggers; 3) internal gazetteer feature; 4) external macro context feature. In this way, the NER problem can be resolved effectively. Evaluation of our system on MUC-6 and MUC-7 English NE tasks achieves F-measures of 96.6% and 94.1% respectively. It shows that the performance is significantly better than reported by any other machine-learning system. Moreover, the performance is even consistently better than those based on handcrafted rules.

The mixed case NER can be used to tag some unlabeled mixed case text, which are then used as additional training material for the upper case NER. We show that this approach reduces the performance gap between the mixed case NER and the upper case NER substantially, by 39% for MUC-6 and 22% for MUC-7 named entity test data. Our method is thus useful in improving the accuracy of NERs on upper case text, such as transcribed text from automatic speech recognizers where case information is missing.

Based on the analysis of two characteristic methodologies in this area, this paper outlines the need for objective methods to evaluate cause-and-effect relations.

Here the inclusion of morphological features of endocardial electrograms can improve the performance. In this study, we present a coupled signal-adapted wavelet-support vector machine (SVM) arrhythmia detection scheme. Within the scope of an electrophysiological examination, data segments were recorded during normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Consecutive beats were selected as morphological activation patterns of NSR and VT. These patterns were represented by their multilevel concentrations. For this, a signal-adapted and highly efficient lattice structure based wavelet decomposition technique was employed which maximizes the class separability and takes the final classification of NSR and VT by hard margin SVMs with radial compactly supported kernels into account. In an automated analysis of an independent test-set, our hybrid scheme outperformed other methods and classified all patterns correctly without overlap.

It is an attractive application for machine learning. The core of this problem is to learn extraction rules from given input. This paper extends a pattern discovery approach called IEPAD to the rapid generation of information extractors that can extract structured data from semi-structured Web documents. IEPAD is proposed to automate wrapper generation from a multiple-record Web page without user-labeled examples. In this paper, we consider another situation when multiple Web pages axe available but each input Web page contains only one record (called singular page). To solve this problem, a hierarchical multiple string alignment approached is proposed to generate the extraction rules from multiple singular pages. In addition, the same method can be applied to IEPAD for finer feature extraction.

In this paper we study specifically datasets with examples that have overlapping feature values for different classes. In these circumstances there is a bound on the classification performance. While there seems to be a race for accuracy, very little has been done to understand and solve the issues related to ambiguous data where the possible classification performance is limited. We discuss the use of SVMs in a proposed scheme to handle classification in such problem domains. A new approach is offered that tries to separate ambiguous data from the data that are much simpler to classify in order to prevent their influence on the classification process. We demonstrate that by separating the ambiguous data, although we lose some data, the performance of the classification increases significantly. In contrast to previous findings with some other classifiers, our experimental results show that the performance of SVM classifiers on cleaned data is not affected significantly when there are some atypical points in the training data.

These catalogs provide valuable and easily accessible information about stellar and galactic spectra, morphological characteristics of galaxies, light curves of variable stars, parallaxes and proper motions of nearby stars, and other data. However, it is not uncommon for them to contain errors. In this work we present an automated technique based on machine learning that enables us to find catalog entries that have a high probability of being erroneous, which can then be subjected to careful analysis an expert. We present experimental results showing the application of the method to a commonly used catalog of spectral indices and stellar atmosphere parameters. The method correctly finds several erroneous entries in the catalog.

Several algorithms based on machine learning have been proposed for this task, providing results that are comparable to those obtained by human experts. However, these algorithms normally require a large set of manually labeled data or training; if the available training set is small, performance is usually poor. In this work we present an approach to automated astronomical classification that performs well in cases where the training set is small by taking advantage of the information contained in the test set, which is usually large. We have applied our method to the problem of predicting stellar atmospheric parameters from spectral information. Experimental results show that our method provides an error reduction of up to 25%.

First, the learning task shall find all valid and non-redundant rules (rule learning). Second, the datasets for learning are very large. When learning from very large databases, the reduction of complexity is of highest importance. We highlight the advantages of combining attribute value discretization with rough set theory to find a subset of attributes that lets the. KDD process discover more useful patterns. We present the evaluation of such approach by providing results from the application of a classification algorithm to various public domain datasets.

These media metadata are often symbolic rather than continuous-valued, and pose significant difficulty to subsequent tasks such as classification and dimensionality reduction which traditionally deal with continuous-valued data. Algorithms commonly employed for these tasks, such as Neural Networks and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), assume a Euclidean distance metric, and they can be applied to symbolic domains only after representing the symbolic labels as integers or real values. Such a data transformation is artificial and the original feature space may not reflect the continuity and neighborhood imposed by the integer/real representation. This paper proposes a novel mechanism that extends tasks traditionally limited to continuous-valued feature spaces, such as (a) dimensionality reduction, (b) de-noising, and (c) clustering, to domains with symbolic features. To this end, we introduce new kernels based on well-known distance metrics, and prove Mercer validity of these kernels for analyzing symbolic feature spaces. We demonstrate their usefulness within the context of kernel-space methods such as Kernel PCA and SVMs, in classifying machine learning datasets from the UCI repository and in temporal clustering and tracking of videotext in multimedia. We show that the generalized kernels help capture information from symbolic feature spaces, visualize symbolic data, and aid tasks such as classification and clustering, and therefore useful in multimodal analysis of multimedia.

This research starts a new direction called Driving by Pattern Matching combined with a Reinforcement Learning algorithm. In specific, this research focuses on the requirement to steer an autonomous car along a curvy and hilly road course with no intersections and no other vehicles respectively obstacles on the road but with the strict requirement to self-improve driving behaviour based on delayed, self-created rewards or punishments. A single connected camera is being used as the basis to quickly (real-time-requirement) build an abstract complete situation description (ACSD) of the situation the vehicle is currently in. Such conversion process is a reduction process and in addition to the requirement of the reduction to the relevant value-containing information, the calculation of such ACSD's has to be very quick. Therefore, this part combines traditional edge finding operators with a new technique of Bayes prediction for each part of the video image. Those ACSD's are being stored together with the steering commands issued at that time and serve as the pattern database of possible driving behaviour which are being retrieved using an Approximate Nearest Neighbour Pattern Matching Algorithm with a O(n log m) characteristic compared to O(n a m) for the conventional nearest neighbour calculation. In addition to this, any feedback on the quality or appropriateness of the driving behaviour has to be self-created (e.g. time measurement for a whole road section) and is therefore delayed and unspecific in relation to single issued steering commands. Consequently, a machine learning algorithm coping with those conditions is being implemented based on Reinforcement Learning.

Among these, a version of the classifier system XCSI achieved performance comparable to the best published results (Wilson 2000). This paper describes some modifications to the XCSI algorithm and to the parameter settings of XCSI that improved its performance noticeably on that problem. The modifications are robust in the presence of noise and appear to reduce the algorithm's tendency to overtrain. This piper describes some of the experiments carried out in the course of the work, and characterizes those changes that seem to have made the greatest impact on the change in performance of the classifier system.

Machine learning is concerned with programs that improve with experience. Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to a number of real world problems, such as data mining, game playing, medical diagnosis, speech recognition and automated control. Reinforcement learning provides an approach in which an agent interacts with the environment and learns by trial and error rather than from direct training examples. In other words, the learning task is specified by rewards and penalties that indirectly tell the agent what it is supposed to do instead of telling it how to accomplish the task. In this article we outline a framework for applying reinforcement learning to optimize the performance of conventional garbage collectors. In this project we have researched an adaptive decision process that makes decisions regarding which garbage collector technique should be invoked and how it should be applied. The decision is based on information about the memory allocation behavior of currently running applications. The system learns through trial and error to take the optimal actions in an initially unknown environment.

It is based on a set of several little neural networks, each one discriminating only two classes. The principles used to perform the decision of classification are : a branch quality index and a selection by elimination. A significant gain in the global classification rate can be obtained by using a GNN. This is illustrated by tests on databases from the UCl machine learning database repository. The experimental results show that a GNN can achieve an improved performance in classification.

This paper introduces an approach for computing the implications of fuzzy rules that consist of multiple input variables. Input variables are partitioned on the basis of information gain, and multiple secondary input attributes are computed by the Choquet fuzzy integral. The proposed model is computationally efficient in both capturing and aggregating attributes at detailed levels.

This paper analyzes data distributions automatic identification using developed new combined structure mode via self-organizing map and support vector machines. First, the paper sets up data distributions identification training sets, which are based on summary statistics including kurtosis, skewness, quantile and cumulative probability. And then, different data distributions are clustered using self-organizing map. Furthermore, the clusters are learned and classified respectively using support vector machines. Finally, random data distribution time series are testing identified in combined structure mode. The results indicate that the approach of the paper is feasible and efficient for automatic identifying data distributions in comparison with other methods.

While standard SVMs solutions involve solving quadratic or linear programming problems, the least squares version of SVMs corresponds to solving a set of linear equations, due to equality instead of inequality constraints in the problem formulation. In LS-SVMs, Mercer condition is still applicable. Hence several types of kernels such as polynomial, RBF's and MLP's can be used. Here we use LS-SVMs to time series prediction compared with radial basis function neural networks. We consider a noisy (Gaussian and uniform noise) Mackey-Glass time series. The results show that least squares support vector machines is excellent for time series prediction even with high noise.

J	Kiang, MY				Kiang, MY			Extending the Kohonen self-organizing map networks for clustering analysis	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Kohenen SOM networks; clustering analysis; artificial intelligence; decision support systems	NEURAL NETWORKS; GROUP TECHNOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; STATE	The self-organizing map (SOM) network was originally designed for solving problems that involve tasks such as clustering, visualization, and abstraction. While Kohonen's SOM networks have been successfully applied as a classification tool to various problem domains, their potential as a robust substitute fur clustering and visualization analysis remains relatively unresearched. We believe the inadequacy of attention in the research and application of using SOM networks as a clustering method is due to its lack of procedures to generate groupings from the SOM output. In this paper, we extend the original Kohonen SOM network to include a contiguity-constrained clustering method to perform clustering based on the output map generated by the network. We compare the result with that of the other clustering tools using a classic problem from the domain of group technology. The result shows that the combination of SOM and the contiguity-constrained clustering method produce clustering results that are comparable with that of the other clustering methods, We further test the applicability of the method with two widely referenced machine-learning cases and compare the results with that of several popular statistical clustering methods.

Data mining is a fast growing application area in business. Machine learning techniques are used for data analysis and pattern discovery and thus can play a key role in the development of data mining applications. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in the context of business is useful in selecting an appropriate method for a specific application. The paper, therefore, provides an overview of machine learning techniques and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in the context of mining business data, A survey of data mining applications in business is provided to investigate the use of learning techniques. Rule induction (RI) was found to be most popular, followed by neural networks (NNs) and case-based reasoning (CBR). Most applications were found in financial areas, where prediction of the future was a dominant task category. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Burgess, CJ; Lefley, M				Burgess, CJ; Lefley, M			Can genetic programming improve software effort estimation? A comparative evaluation	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						case-based reasoning; genetic programming; machine learning; neural networks; software effort estimation	PREDICTION MODELS; NEURAL NETWORKS; VALIDATION; DESIGN; COST	Accurate software effort estimation is an important part of the software process. Originally, estimation was performed using only human expertise, but more recently, attention has turned to a variety of machine learning (ML) methods. This paper attempts to evaluate critically the potential of genetic programming (GP) in software effort estimation when compared with previously published approaches, in terms of accuracy and ease of use. The comparison is based on the well-known Desharnais data set of 81 software projects derived from a Canadian software house in the late 1980s. The input variables are restricted to those available from the specification stage and significant effort is put into the GP and all of the other solution strategies to offer a realistic and fair comparison. There is evidence that GP can offer significant improvements in accuracy but this depends on the measure and interpretation of accuracy used. GP has the potential to be a valid additional tool for software effort estimation but set up and running effort is high and interpretation difficult, as it is for any complex meta-heuristic technique.

The main advantage of a Software Project Simulator (SPS) is the possibility of experimenting with different decisions to be taken at no cost. In this paper, we present a new approach based on the combination of an SPS and Evolutionary Computation. The purpose is to provide accurate decision rules in order to help the project manager to take decisions at any time in the development. The SPS generates a database from the software project, which is provided as input to the evolutionary algorithm for producing the set of management rules. These rules will help the project manager to keep the project within the cost, quality and duration targets. The set of alternatives within the decision-making framework is therefore reduced to a quality set of decisions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The authors performed this study to assess the performance of a computer-based classification system that uses gaze locations of observers to define the subspace for machine learning. Materials and Methods. Thirty-two dental radiographs were classified by an expert viewer into four categories of disease of the periapical region: no disease (normal tooth), mild disease (widened periodontal ligament space), moderate disease (destruction of the lamina dura), and severe disease (resorption of bone in the periapical area). There were eight images in each category. Six observers independently viewed the images while their eye gaze position was recorded. They then classified the images into one of the four categories. A sample of image space was used as input to a machine learning routine to develop a machine classifier. Sample space was determined with three techniques: visual gaze, random selection, and constrained random selection. kappa analyses were used to compare classification accuracies with the three sampling techniques. Results. With use of the expert classification as a standard of reference, observers classified images with 57% accuracy, and the machine classified images with 84% accuracy by using the same gaze-selected features and image space. Results Of kappa analyses revealed mean values of 0.78 for gaze-selected sampling, 0.69 for random sampling, 0.68 for constrained random selection, and 0.44 for observers. The use of sample space selected with the visual gaze technique was superior to that selected with both random-selection techniques and by the observers. Conclusion. Machine classification of dental images improves the accuracy of individual observers using gaze-selected image space.

J	Tomlinson, A; Bull, L				Tomlinson, A; Bull, L			Symbiogenesis in learning classifier systems	ARTIFICIAL LIFE			English	Article						animat; cooperation; evolution; genetic linkage; symbiosis		Symbiosis is the phenomenon in which organisms of different species live together in close association, resulting in a raised level of fitness for one or more of the organisms. Symbiogenesis is the name given to the process by which symbiotic partners combine and unify, that is, become genetically linked, giving rise to new morphologies and physiologies evolutionarily more advanced than their constituents. The importance of this process in the evolution of complexity is now well established. Learning classifier systems are a machine learning technique that uses both evolutionary computing techniques and reinforcement learning to develop a population of cooperative rules to solve a given task. In this article we examine the use of symbiogenesis within the classifier system rule base to improve their performance. Results show that incorporating simple rule linkage does not give any benefits. The concept of (temporal) encapsulation is then added to the symbiotic rules and shown to improve performance in ambiguous/non-Markov environments.

J	Soon, WM; Ng, HT; Lim, DCY				Soon, WM; Ng, HT; Lim, DCY			A machine learning approach to coreference resolution of noun phrases	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article								In this paper, we present a learning approach to coreference resolution of noun phrases in unrestricted text. The approach learns from a small, annotated corpus and the task includes resolving not just a certain type of noun phrase (e. g., pronouns) but rather general noun phrases. It also does not restrict the entity types of the noun phrases; that is, coreference is assigned whether they are of "organization," "person," or other types. We evaluate our approach on common data sets (namely, the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference corpora) and obtain encouraging results, indicating that on the general noun phrase coreference task, the learning approach holds promise and achieves accuracy comparable to that of nonlearning approaches. Our system is the first learning-based system that offers performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art nonlearning systems on these data sets.

In a benchmark test, the SVM is compared to several machine learning techniques currently used in the field. The classification task involves predicting the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by pyrimidines, using data obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. Three artificial neural networks, a radial basis function network, and a C5.0 decision tree are all outperformed by the SVM. The SVM is significantly better than all of these, bar a manually capacity-controlled neural network, which takes considerably longer to train. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates the use of topological information to circumvent problems encountered during previous experiments, namely (1) matching of non-structurally related secondary structures and (2) scaling problems. Cross-validation tests were carried out for 20 folds. The overall estimated accuracy is 73.37 +/-0.35%. The new representation allows us to process the complete set of examples, while previously it was necessary to sample the negative examples. Topological information is used in approximately 90% of the rules presented here. Information about the topology of a sheet is present in 63% of the rules. This set of rules presents characteristics of the overall architecture of the fold. In contrast. 26% of the rules contain topological information which is limited to the packing of a restricted number of secondary structures, as such, the later set resembles those found in our previous studies.

The original process equation was developed to model phytoplankton abundance based on measured limnological and climate variables. A genetic algorithm is shown to be capable of calibrating the constants of the process model, based on the data describing a lake environment. The resulting process model has a significantly improved performance based on unseen test data. A symbolic genetic algorithm is then applied to the process model to evolve new expressions for the grazing term of the equation. The results indicate that this approach can be used to explore new process formulations and to improve the generalisation and predictive response of process models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Patterns in chemical and physical parameters of the lake and corresponding presence or absence of highly abundant blue-green algae species such as Microcystis spp, Oscillatoria spp and Phormidium spp are discovered by the machine learning algorithm. Learnt patterns are represented explicitly as classification rules, which allow their underlying hypothesis to be examined. Models are developed for the filamentous blue-green algae Oscillatoria spp and Phormidium spp, and the colonial blue-green algae Microcystis spp. Hypothesized environmental conditions which favour blooms of the three species are contrasted and examined. The models are evaluated on independent test data to demonstrate that models can be evolved which differentiate algae species on the basis of the environmental attributes provided.

The models can thus be inspected, modified, used and verified by human experts and have the potential to become part of the knowledge in the respective application domain. Applications of symbolic machine learning methods to ecological modelling problems are numerous and varied, ranging from modelling algal growth in lagoons and lakes (e.g. in the Venice lagoon) to predicting biodegradation rates for chemicals. This paper gives an overview of machine learning applications to ecological modelling, focussing on applications of symbolic machine learning and giving more detailed accounts of several such applications.

This work describes the application of an evolutionary computation framework for the discovery of predictive equations and rules for phytoplankton abundance in freshwater lakes from time series data. The suggested framework evolves several different equations and rules, based on limnological and climate variables. The results demonstrate that non-linear processes in natural systems may be successfully modelled through the use of evolutionary computation techniques. Further, it shows that a grammar based genetic programming system may be used as a tool for exploring the driving processes underlying freshwater system dynamics. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Artificial neural networks were demonstrated to be very useful for nonlinear ordination and visualization of ecological data by Kohonen networks, and ecological time-series modelling by recurrent networks. Genetic algorithms proved to be very innovative for hybridizing deductive models, and evolving predictive rules, process equations and parameters. Newly emerging adaptive agents provide a novel framework for the discovery and forecasting of emergent ecosystem structures and behaviours in response to environmental changes.

J	Sette, S; Boullart, L				Sette, S; Boullart, L			Genetic programming: principles and applications	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						genetic programming; genetic algorithms; textiles fibre-to-yarn; production process	NEURAL NETS	Genetic algorithms (GA) has given rise to two new fields of research where (global) optimisation is of crucial importance: 'genetic based machine learning' (GBML) and 'genetic programming' (GP). An introduction by the authors to GA and GBML was given in two previous papers (Eng. Appl. Artif. Intell. 9 (6) (1996) 681: Eng. Appl. Artif. Intell. 13(4) (2000) 381). In this paper. the last domain (GP) will be introduced. thereby making up a trilogy which gives a general overview of the whole field. In this third part, an overview will be given of the basic concepts of GP as defined by Koza. A first (educational) example of GP is given by solving a simple symbolic regression of a sinus function. Finally. a more complex application is presented in which GP is used to construct the mathematical equations for an industrial process. To this end. the case study 'fibre-to-yarn production process' is introduced. The goal of this study is the automatic development of mathematical equations for the prediction of spinnability and (possible) resulting yarn strength. It is shown that (relatively) simple equations can be obtained which describe accurately 90% of the fibre-to-yarn database. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Geurts, P; Olaru, C; Wehenkel, L				Geurts, P; Olaru, C; Wehenkel, L			Improving the bias/variance tradeoff of decision trees: towards soft tree induction	ENGINEERING INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Brazilian Conference on Neural Networks	2001	RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL			decision trees; variance; threshold softening		One of the main difficulties with standard top down induction of decision trees comes from the high variance of these methods. High variance means that, for a given problem and sample size, the resulting tree is strongly dependent on the random nature of the particular sample used for training. Consequently, these algorithms tend to be suboptimal in terms of accuracy and interpretability. This paper analyses this problem in depth and proposes a new method, relying on threshold softening, able to significantly improve the bias/variance tradeoff of decision trees. The algorithm is validated on a number of benchmark problems and its relationship with fuzzy decision tree induction is discussed. This sheds some light on the success of fuzzy decision tree induction and improves our understanding of machine learning, in general.

The combining of standard signal processing techniques and machine learning methods (in this case, a neural network) has been essential to obtaining good performance.

J	Sivanandam, SN; Shanmugam, A; Sumathi, S; Usha, K				Sivanandam, SN; Shanmugam, A; Sumathi, S; Usha, K			Development of soft computing models for data mining	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND MATERIALS SCIENCES			English	Article							DECISION TREES; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	The increasing amount and complexity of today's data available in science, business, industry and many other areas creates an urgent need to accelerate discovery of knowledge in large databases. Such data cart provide a rich resource for knowledge discovery and decision support, To understand, analyze and eventually use this data, a multidisciplinary approach called data mining has been proposed. Technically, data mining is the process of finding correlation or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational databases. Pattern classification is one particular category of data mining, which enables the discovery of knowledge from very large databases (VLDB). In this paper, mining the database through pattern classification has been done by utilizing two important mining tools called K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm and Decision trees. The K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) is the popularly used conventional statistical approach for data mining. K-NN is a technique that classifies each record in a data set based on a combination of the classes of K-records most similar to it in a historical data set. The fuzzy version of K-NN, crisp and fuzzy versions of nearest prototype classifiers have also been proposed. Decision tree is one of the best machine learning approaches for data mining. A decision tree is a predictive model that as its name implies, can be viewed as a tree. Briefly, decision trees are tree shaped structures that represent sets of decisions. These decisions generate rules for classification of a data set. Classification and Regression Tree (CART), ID3 are the two decision tree methods used in this paper. The classification rules have been extracted in the form of IF THEN rules. The performance analysis of K-NN methods and tree-based classifiers has been done. The proposed methods have been tested on three applications such as land sat imagery, letter image recognition and optical recognition of hand written digits data. The simulation algorithms have been implemented using C++ under UNIX platform.

J	Tejada, S; Knoblock, CA; Minton, S				Tejada, S; Knoblock, CA; Minton, S			Learning object identification rules for information integration	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						information integration; machine learning; data cleaning; record linkage; object identification; active learning	RECORD-LINKAGE; SYSTEMS	When integrating information from multiple websites, the same data objects can exist in inconsistent text formats across sites, making it difficult to identify matching objects using exact text match. We have developed an object identification system called Active Atlas, which compares the objects' shared attributes in order to identify matching objects. Certain attributes are more important for deciding if a mapping should exist between two objects. Previous methods of object identification have required manual construction of object identification rules or mapping rules for determining the mappings between objects. This manual process is time consuming and error-prone. In our approach. Active Atlas learns to tailor mapping rules, through limited user input, to a specific application domain. The experimental results demonstrate that we achieve higher accuracy and require less user involvement than previous methods across various application domains. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Reliable prognostic models that are based on survival analysis techniques have been recently applied to a variety of domains, with varying degrees of success. In this article, we review some methods commonly used to model time-oriented data, such as Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards, and logistic regression, and discuss their applications in medical prognosis. Nonlinear, nonparametric models such as neural networks have increasingly been used for building prognostic models. We review their use in several medical domains and discuss different implementation strategies. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are outlined, as well as pointers to pertinent literature. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).

We focus our discussion on the ability to discriminate between authors for the case of both aggregated e-mail topics as well as across different email topics. An extended set of e-mail document features including structural characteristics and linguistic patterns were derived and, together with a Support Vector Machine learning algorithm, were used for mining the e-mail content. Experiments using a number of e-mail documents generated by different authors on a set of topics gave promising results for both aggregated and multi-topic author categorisation.

J	Rahm, E; Bernstein, PA				Rahm, E; Bernstein, PA			A survey of approaches to automatic schema matching	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article						schema matching; schema integration; graph matching; model management; machine learning	HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES; SYSTEM	Schema matching is a basic problem in many database application domains, such as data integration, E-business, data warehousing, and semantic query processing. In current implementations, schema matching is typically performed manually, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, previous research papers have proposed many techniques to achieve a partial automation of the match operation for specific application domains. We present a taxonomy that covers many of these existing approaches, and we describe the approaches in some detail. In particular, we distinguish between schema-level and instance-level, element-level and structure-level, and language-based and constraint-based matchers. Based on our classification we review some previous match implementations thereby indicating which part of the solution space they cover. We intend our taxonomy and review of past work to be useful when comparing different approaches to schema matching, when developing a new match algorithm, and when implementing a schema matching component.

J	Mundt, JC; Ferber, KL; Rizzo, M; Greist, JH				Mundt, JC; Ferber, KL; Rizzo, M; Greist, JH			Computer-automated dementia screening using a touch-tone telephone	ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article							OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEMS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INTERVIEW; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Background: This study investigated the sensitivity and specificity of a computer-automated telephone system to evaluate cognitive impairment in elderly callers to identify signs of early dementia. Methods: The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale was used to assess 155 subjects aged 56 to 93 years (n=74, 27, 42, and 12, with a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively). These subjects performed a battery of tests administered by an interactive voice response system using standard Touch-Tone telephones. Seventy-four collateral informants also completed an interactive voice response version of the Symptoms of Dementia Screener. Results: Sixteen cognitively impaired subjects were unable to complete the telephone call, Performances on 6 of 8 tasks were significantly influenced by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale status. The mean (SD) call length was 12 minutes 27 seconds (2 minutes 32 seconds). A subsample (n=116) was analyzed using machine-learning methods, producing a scoring algorithm that combined performances across 4 tasks. Results indicated a potential sensitivity of 82.0% and specificity of 85.5%. The scoring model generalized to a validation subsample (n=39), producing 85.0% sensitivity and 78.9% specificity. The kappa agreement between predicted and actual group membership was 0.64 (P<.001). Of the 16 subjects unable to complete the call, 11 provided sufficient information to permit us to classify them as impaired, Standard scoring of the interactive voice response-administered Symptoms of Dementia Screener (completed by informants) produced a screening sensitivity of 63.5% and 100% specificity. A lower criterion found a 90.4% sensitivity, without lowering specificity. Conclusions: Computer-automated telephone screening for early dementia using either informant or direct assessment is feasible. Such systems could provide wide-scale, cost-effective screening, education, and referral services to patients and caregivers.

J	Guimaraes, G; Peter, JH; Penzel, T; Ultsch, A				Guimaraes, G; Peter, JH; Penzel, T; Ultsch, A			A method for automated temporal knowledge acquisition applied to sleep-related breathing disorders	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						temporal-abstraction; machine learning; grammatical inference; self-organizing neural networks; sleep-related breathing disorders	RECOGNITION; NETWORKS	This paper presents a method for the discovery of temporal patterns in multivariate time series and their conversion into a linguistic knowledge representation applied to sleep-related breathing disorders. The main idea ties in introducing several abstraction levels that allow a step-wise identification of temporal patterns. Self-organizing neural networks are used to discover elementary patterns in the time series. Machine learning (NIL) algorithms use the results of the neural networks to automatically generate a rule-based description. At the next levels, temporal grammatical rules are inferred. This method covers one of the main "bottlenecks" in the design of knowledge-based systems, namely, the knowledge acquisition problem. An evaluation of the rules lead to an overall sensitivity of 0.762, and a specificity of 0.758. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, XH; Cercone, N				Hu, XH; Cercone, N			Discovering maximal generalized decision rules through horizontal and vertical data reduction	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						knowledge acquisition and machine learning; knowledge base technology; intelligent database; Al algorithms; data mining		We present a method to learn maximal generalized decision rules from databases by integrating discretization, generalization and rough set feature selection. Our method reduces the data horizontally and vertically, In the first phase, discretization and generalization are integrated and the numeric attributes are discretized into a few intervals. The primitive values of symbolic attributes are replaced by high level concepts and some obvious superfluous or irrelevant symbolic attributes are also eliminated. Horizontal reduction is accomplished by merging identical tuples after the substitution of an attribute value by its higher level value in a pre-defined concept hierarchy for symbolic attributes, or the discretization of continuous (or numeric) attributes. This phase greatly decreases the number of tuples in the database. In the second phase, a novel context-sensitive feature merit measure is used to rank the features, a subset of relevant attributes is chosen based on rough set theory and the merit values of the features. A reduced table is obtained by removing those attributes which are not in the relevant attributes subset and the data set is further reduced vertically without destroying the interdependence relationships between classes and the attributes. Then rough set-based value reduction is further performed on the reduced table and all redundant condition values are dropped. Finally, tuples in the reduced table are transformed into a set of maximal generalized decision rules. The experimental results on UCI data sets and a real market database demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the feature space and improve learning accuracy.

J	Castro, JL; Castro-Sanchez, JJ; Zurita, JM				Castro, JL; Castro-Sanchez, JJ; Zurita, JM			Use of a fuzzy machine learning technique in the knowledge acquisition process	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge acquisition; machine learning; genetic algorithms	EXPERT-SYSTEMS; RULES	Acquiring the knowledge to support an expert system is one of the key activities in knowledge engineering. Knowledge acquisition (KA) is closely related to research in the machine learning field. Any machine learning acquires some knowledge, but not enough knowledge for building expert systems. The aim of this article is to present a new approach to machine learning which helps to acquire knowledge when building expert systems. This technique will acquire the more general knowledge that should be used for extending, updating and improving an incomplete and partially incorrect knowledge base (KB). The main claim of our approach is that the system will start with poor knowledge, provided by the expert or the organization to which he belongs. A machine learning technique will evolve it to an incomplete KB, which may be used for further interactions with the expert, that will incrementally extend and improve it until obtaining a complete KB (i.e., with complete inferential capabilities).

Unfortunately, despite extensive research over more than 30 years, this remains a significant problem for many practitioners. A major obstacle is the absence of reliable and systematic historic data, yet this is a sine qua non for almost all proposed methods: statistical, machine learning or calibration of existing models. In this paper, we describe our sparse data method (SDM) based upon a pairwise comparison technique and Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Our minimum data requirement is a single known point. The technique is supported by a software tool known as DataSalvage. We show, for data from two companies, how our approach-based upon expert judgement-adds value to expert judgement by producing significantly more accurate and less biased results. A sensitivity analysis shows that our approach is robust to pairwise comparison errors. We then describe the results of a small usability trial with a practicing project manager. From this empirical work, we conclude that the technique is promising and may help overcome some of the present barriers to effective project prediction.

J	Shepperd, M; Kadoda, G				Shepperd, M; Kadoda, G			Comparing software prediction techniques using simulation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Software Metrics Symposium	APR 04-06, 2001	LONDON, ENGLAND	IEEE		prediction system; simulation; machine learning; data set characteristic		The need for accurate software prediction systems increases as software becomes much larger and more complex. A variety of techniques have been proposed; however, none has proven consistently accurate and there is still much uncertainty as to what technique suits which type of prediction problem. We believe that the underlying characteristics-size, number of features, type of distribution, etc-of the data set influence the choice of the prediction system to be used. For this reason, we would like to control the characteristics of such data sets in order to systematically explore the relationship between accuracy, choice of prediction system, and data set characteristic. Also, in previous work, it has proven difficult to obtain significant results over small data sets. Consequently, it would be useful to have a large validation data set. Our solution is to simulate data allowing both control and the possibility of large (1,000) validation cases. In this paper, we compared four prediction techniques: regression, rule induction, nearest neighbor (a form of case-based reasoning), and neural nets. The results suggest that there are significant differences depending upon the characteristics of the data set. Consequently, researchers should consider prediction context when evaluating competing prediction systems. We also observed that the more "messy" the data and the more complex the relationship with the dependent variable, the more variability in the results. In the more complex cases, we observed significantly different results depending upon the particular training set that has been sampled from the underlying data set. This suggests that researchers will need to exercise caution when comparing different approaches and utilize procedures such as bootstrapping in order to generate multiple samples for training purposes. However, our most important result is that it is more fruitful to ask which is the best prediction system in a particular context rather than which is the "best" prediction system.

This control is also exerted on the purA and purR genes. A consensus sequence for the binding of PurR, named the PurBox, has been suggested (M. Kilstrup, S.G. Jessing, S.B. Wichmand-Jorgensen, M. Madsen, and D. Nilsson, J. Bacteriol. 180:3900-3906, 1998). To determine whether the expression of other genes might be regulated by PurR, we performed a search for PurBox sequences in the B. subtilis genome sequence and found several candidate PurBoxes. By the use of transcriptional lacZ fusions, five selected genes or operons (glyA, yumD, yebB, xpt-pbuX, and yqhZ-folD), all having a putative PurBox in their upstream regulatory regions, were found to be regulated by PurR. Using a machine-learning algorithm developed for sequence pattern finding, we found that all of the genes identified as being PurR regulated have two PurBoxes in their upstream control regions. The two boxes are divergently oriented, forming a palindromic sequence with the inverted repeats separated by 16 or 17 nucleotides. A computerized search revealed one additional PurR-regulated gene, ytiP. The significance of the tandem PurBox motifs was demonstrated in vivo by deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the two PurBox sequences located upstream of glyA. All six genes or operons encode enzymes or transporters playing a role in purine nucleotide metabolism. Functional analysis showed that yebB encodes the previously characterized hypoxanthine-guanine permease PbuG and that ytiP encodes another guanine-hypoxanthine permease and is now named pbuO. yumD encodes a GMP reductase and is now named guaC.

The completeness of the algorithms for Pawlak reduct and the uniqueness for a given order of the attributes are proved. Since a discernibility matrix requires the size of the memory of \U \ (2), U is a universe of objects, it would be impossible to apply these algorithms directly to a massive object set. In order to solve the problem, a so-called quasi-discernibility matrix and two reduction algorithms are proposed. Although the proposed algorithms are incomplete for Pawlak reduct, their optimal paradigms ensure the completeness as long as they satisfy some conditions. Finally, we consider the problem on the reduction of distributive object sets.

Likelihood measures from the feature identification process are shown to provide a well behaved measure of signal interpretation confidence. We demonstrate that complex, transient signals, from one of 6 classes, can reliably be identified at signal to noise ratios of 2 and that identification does not fail until the signal to noise ratio has reached 1. Results show that the loss in identification performance resulting from the use of a heuristic, rather than an exhaustive, search strategy is minimal.

Here we describe the use of large-scale RNA profiling and supervised machine learning algorithms to construct a first-generation molecular classification scheme for carcinomas of the prostate, breast, lung, ovary, colorectum, kidney, liver, pancreas, bladder/ureter, and gastroesophagus, which collectively account for similar to 70% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States. The classification scheme was based on identifying gene subsets whose expression typifies each cancer class, and we quantified the extent to which these genes are characteristic of a specific tumor type by accurately and confidently predicting the anatomical site of tumor origin for 90% of 175 carcinomas, including 9 of 12 metastatic lesions. The predictor gene subsets include those whose expression is typical of specific types of normal epithelial differentiation, as well as other genes whose expression is elevated in cancer. This study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting the tissue origin of a carcinoma in the context of multiple cancer classes.

Study design: Prospective study. Methods: Activation of alarms on BP was regulated with a protocol. Sounding alarms were either inactivated when patient's haemodynamic status was stable (group 1), or activated when it was unstable (group 2). The frequency of BP measurement was one every 15 min. For all mean BP value recorded, the following criteria were analyzed : 1) normality of the value compared to ranges 65 -115 mmHg in group 1 or compared to alarm thresholds in group 2; 2) consequences on the care and therapeutic; 3) delay when an abnormal value was detected and managed after more than 15 min. Results: 1,674 hours of monitoring from 42 patients, allowed the analysis of 6,695 measurements of mean BP, 3,092 in group 1 and 3,603 in group 2. In group 1, 2,822 measurements were considered as normal and 3,094 measures in group 2. Eight measurements had consequences on therapeutic in group 1, with only one with delay in care giving. 287 measurements had consequences on therapeutic in group 2, 8 with delay in care giving. Six per cent of abnormal measurements in group 2 were managed with delay. This protocol reduced by 52% the production of sounding alarms on BP, without noxious effects for the patients. Conclusion: Selective activation of sounding alarms on BP, according to the patient haemodynamic status, reduced noise pollution and could be one solution to improve monitoring efficiency in intensive care unit.

J	Niimi, A; Tazaki, E				Niimi, A; Tazaki, E			Combined method of genetic programming and association rule algorithm	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Genetic programming (GP) usually has a wide search space and a high flexibility. Therefore, GP may search for global optimum solution. But, in general, GPs learning speed is not so fast. An apriori algorithm is one of association rule algorithms. It can be applied to a large database. But it is difficult to define its parameters without experience. We propose a rule generation technique from a database using GP combined with an association rule algorithm. It takes rules generated by the association rule algorithm as initial individual of GP. The learning speed of GP is improved by the combined algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the decision tree construction problem from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine-learning repository, and rule disco very problem from the occurrence of the hypertension database. We compare the results of the proposed method with prior ones.

Nowadays, some programs are better than human players in most classical games. Their results highlight the efficiency of Al methods that are now quite standard. Such methods are very useful to Go programs, but they do not enable a strong Go program to be built. The problems related to Computer Go require new AI problem solving methods. Given the great number of problems and the diversity of possible solutions, Computer Go is an attractive research domain for Al. Prospective methods of programming the game of Go will probably be of interest in other domains as well. The goal of this paper is to present Computer Go by showing the links between existing studies on Computer Go and different AI related domains: evaluation function, heuristic search, machine learning, automatic knowledge generation, mathematical morphology and cognitive science. In addition, this paper describes both the practical aspects of Go programming, such as program optimization, and various theoretical aspects such as combinatorial game theory, mathematical morphology, and Monte Carlo methods.

We use a six-step knowledge discovery process. A database consisting of 267 cleaned patient SPECT images (about 3000 2D images), accompanied by clinical information and physician interpretation was created first. Then, a new user-friendly algorithm for computerizing the diagnostic process was designed and implemented. SPECT images were processed to extract a set of features, and then explicit rules were generated, using inductive machine learning and heuristic approaches to mimic cardiologist's diagnosis. The system is able to provide a set of computer diagnoses for cardiac SPECT studies, and can be used as a diagnostic tool by a cardiologist. The achieved results are encouraging because of the high correctness of diagnoses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the light of our medical staff's experience, the consequences of TIPS are not homogeneous for all the patients and a subgroup dies in the first 6 months after TIPS placement. Actually, there is no risk indicator to identify this subgroup of patients before treatment. An investigation for predicting the survival of cirrhotic patients treated with TIPS is carried out using a clinical database with 107 cases and 77 attributes. Four supervised machine learning classifiers are applied to discriminate between both subgroups of patients. The application of several feature subset selection (FSS) techniques has significantly improved the predictive accuracy of these classifiers and considerably reduced the amount of attributes in the classification models. Among FSS techniques, FSS-TREE, a new randomized algorithm inspired on the new EDA (estimation of distribution algorithm) paradigm has obtained the best average accuracy results for each classifier.

The important task of the proposed new kind of intelligent control is to respond autonomously and problem-equivalent to complex or unknown situations. This includes learning capabilities and a well organized dynamic memory. The contribution introduces into the developed Situation-Operator model as the texturing theoretical background, into the complete concept, and classifies the known control approaches in the developed system-theoretic view of control and interaction, with or without autonomy.

J	Bryson, N; Joseph, A				Bryson, N; Joseph, A			Optimal techniques for class-dependent attribute discretization	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						data mining; attribute discretization; decision trees; machine learning; entropy; parametric linear programming	SELECTION	Preprocessing of raw data has been shown to improve performance of knowledge discovery processes. Discretization of quantitative attributes is a key component of preprocessing and has the potential to greatly impact the efficiency of the process and the quality of its outcomes. In attribute discretization, the value domain of an attribute is partitioned into a finite set of intervals so that the attribute can be described using a small number of discrete representations. Discretization therefore involves two decisions, on the number of intervals and the placement of interval boundaries. Previous approaches for quantitative attribute discretization have used heuristic algorithms to identify partitions of the attribute value domain. Therefore, these approaches cannot be guaranteed to provide the optimal solution for the given discretization criterion and number of intervals. In this paper, we use linear programming (LP) methods to formulate the attribute discretization problem. The LP formulation allows the discretization criterion and the number of intervals to be integral considerations of the problem. We conduct experiments and identify optimal solutions for various discretization criteria and numbers of intervals.

J	Breiman, L				Breiman, L			Random forests	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						classification; regression; ensemble		Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.

J	Brodie, M; DeJong, G				Brodie, M; DeJong, G			Iterated phantom induction: A knowledge-based approach to learning control	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						control learning; explanation-based learning; reinforcement learning; prior knowledge; phantom points		We advance a knowledge-based learning method that allows prior domain knowledge to be effectively utilized by machine learning systems. The domain knowledge is incorporated not into the learning algorithm itself but instead affects only the training data. The domain knowledge is used to explain and then transform the actual training examples into a more informative set of imaginary, or "phantom" examples. These phantom examples are added to the training set; the experienced examples are discarded. A new control policy is induced from the phantom training set. This policy is then exercised, yielding additional training points, and the process repeats. We investigate the performance of this method in a stylized air-hockey domain which demands a difficult nonlinear control policy. Our experiments show that, surprisingly, an accurate policy can be learned even if the domain theory is only imprecise and approximate. We advance an interpretation which indicates that the information available from a plausible qualitative domain theory is sufficient for robust successful learning. This interpretation is used to make a number of predictions which are tested in subsequent experiments. The outcomes confirm the interpretation and the robustness of the approach.

J	Carter, RJ; Dubchak, I; Holbrook, SR				Carter, RJ; Dubchak, I; Holbrook, SR			A computational approach to identify genes for functional RNAs in genomic sequences	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI GENOME; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; GNRA TETRALOOPS; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; OLIGONUCLEOTIDES; EXPRESSION; SELECTION; REPAIR; MOTIFS	Currently there is no successful computational approach for identification of genes encoding novel functional RNAs (fRNAs) in genomic sequences. We have developed a machine learning approach using neural networks and support vector machines to extract common features among known RNAs for prediction of new RNA genes in the unannotated regions of prokaryotic and archaeal genomes. The Escherichia coli genome was used for development, but we have applied this method to several other bacterial and archaeal genomes. Networks based on nucleotide composition were 80-90% accurate in jackknife testing experiments for bacteria and 90-99% for hyperthermophilic archaea. We also achieved a significant improvement in accuracy by combining these predictions with those obtained using a second set of parameters consisting of known RNA sequence motifs and the calculated free energy of folding. Several known fRNAs not included in the training datasets were identified as well as several hundred predicted novel RNAs. These studies indicate that there are many unidentified RNAs in simple genomes that can be predicted computationally as a precursor to experimental study.

J	Lawrence, RL; Wright, A				Lawrence, RL; Wright, A			Rule-based classification systems using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; NEURAL-NETWORK; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; ANCILLARY DATA; GIS DATA; INTEGRATION	Incorporating ancillary data into image classification can increase classification accuracy and precision. Rule-based classification systems using expert systems or machine learning are a particularly useful means of incorporating ancillary data, but have been difficult to implement. We developed a means for creating a rule-based classification using classification and regression tree analysis (CART), a commonly available statistical method. The CART Classification does not require expert knowledge, automatically selects useful spectral and ancillary data from data supplied by the analyst, and can be used with continuous and categorical ancillary data. We demonstrated the use of the CART classification at three increasingly detailed classification levels for a portion of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Overall accuracies ranged from 96 percent at level 1, to 79 percent at level 2, and 65 percent at level 3.

J	Czerminski, R; Yasri, A; Hartsough, D				Czerminski, R; Yasri, A; Hartsough, D			Use of Support Vector Machine in pattern classification: Application to QSAR studies	QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS			English	Article						SVM; QSAR; ANN; classification; cross-validation	NEURAL NETWORKS; TUTORIAL; DESIGN	The Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach for classification and regression problems was originally developed by Vapnik and co-workers [1]. For the last few years it has been gaining acceptance in the machine learning community [2]. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate SVM performance in the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) domain for classification applications and to compare the performance of one particular implementation of an SVM [3] to one particular implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) [4]. For this purpose, we used artificial data simulating various response surfaces, and biological data derived from the literature covering various pharmacological domains. The results obtained on biological data are also compared to previous work using other modeling techniques. We also discuss the usage of SVM in building QSAR models for biological activity of drugs.

Machine Learning algorithms can help us to: (a) extract operative human knowledge from a set of examples; (b) conclude interpretable rules for classifying samples regardless of the non-linearity of the human behaviour or process; and (c) help us to ascertain the degree of influence of each objective attribute of the assessed food on the final decision of an expert. We illustrate these topics with an example of how it is possible to clone the behaviour of bovine carcass classifiers, leading to possible further industrial applications.

J	Guillaume, S; Charnomordic, B				Guillaume, S; Charnomordic, B			Knowledge discovery for control purposes in food industry databases	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy logic; genetic algorithm; machine learning; knowledge discovery; process control; food industry; cheesemaking		Sets of experimental data describing a product at various processing steps are widely available in food industry. Decisions taken by the human operator all through the process are implicitly contained in such a database, as well as the recorded consequences on the product. The aim of this work is knowledge discovery. This knowledge must be expressed in a way that allows cooperation with the expert's knowledge. The system is implemented as a self-learning fuzzy controller, with the rule conclusions being optimized by a genetic algorithm. The role of the fuzzy controller architecture is to provide a learning framework, the database being used for rule validation, thus acquiring hidden knowledge. In order to make inferred knowledge easy to understand, a rule and variable selection methodology has been developed. Data from a cheesemaking process were used to test our approach.

J	V'yugin, VV				V'yugin, VV			Most sequences are stochastic	INFORMATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article								The central problem in machine learning (and statistics) is the problem of predicting future events x(n)+1 based on past observations x(1)x(2)...x(n), where n = 1,2.... The main goal is to find a method of prediction that minimizes the total loss suffered on a sequence x(1)x(2)... x(n+1) for n = 1, 2.... we say that a data sequence is stochastic if there exists a simply described prediction algorithm whose performance is close to the best possible one. This optimal performance is defined in terms of Vovk's predictive complexity, which is a generalization of the notion of Kolmogorov complexity. Predictive complexity gives a limit on the predictive performance of simply described prediction algorithms. In this paper we argue that data sequences normally occurring in the real world are stochastic; more formally, we prove that Levin's a priori semimeasure of nonstochastic sequences is small.

Although the two fields have a long-standing tradition and can be considered technologically mature, past research in applying ML techniques to CV problems has been limited. After a short introduction in the fields of computer vision and machine learning, we highlight some important issues in the intersection of the two areas and sketch both current achievements and future research directions. Our goal is to help the reader put the six contributions of this special issue into the proper context.

J	Song, A; Ciesielski, V; Rogers, P				Song, A; Ciesielski, V; Rogers, P			Vision system development by machine learning: Mashing assessment in brewing	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	This article describes the development of a machine vision application for automatic process assessment by image analysis and machine learning. The system is required to differentiate between the various stages of a mashing process and determine the termination point. A large number of histograms, Haralick and Gabor features (835) were extracted from 275 training images. Three feature selection algorithms-wrapper, consistency filter, and correlation filter-were then applied to the training data, resulting in feature sets of size 29, 15, and 11, respectively. A number of decision tree, rule induction, and nearest neighbor classification algorithms were then applied to the reduced data set. For discriminating seven stages of the mashing process, the highest accuracy obtained was 71.6%. For the binary problem of differentiating the finished state from all of the other states the accuracy was 92.0%. This accuracy is good enough for deployment. The results indicate that using a large library of features and machine-learning methods for removing redundant features can significantly reduce development times for vision systems by eliminating the time-consuming manual search for the best discriminating features.

J	Siermala, M; Juhola, M; Vihinen, M				Siermala, M; Juhola, M; Vihinen, M			On preprocessing of protein sequences for neural network prediction of polyproline type II secondary structures	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						neural networks; proteins; prediction of polyproline type II secondary structures; polyproline type II structure; PPII	TYROSINE KINASES; RECOGNITION; DNA	Polyproline type II stretches are somewhat rare on proteins. The backbone of this secondary structural element folds to a triangular form instead of the normal alpha -helix with 3.6 residues per turn. It is a very challenging task to try to detect them computationally from protein sequence. Here, we have studied the preprocessing phase in particular, which is important for any machine learning method. Preprocessing included selection of relevant data from the Protein Data Bank and investigation of learnability properties. These properties show whether the material is suitable for neural network computing. The complexity of algorithms in connection with preprocessing was briefly considered. We found that feedforward perceptron neural networks were appropriate for the prediction of polyproline type II and also relatively efficient in this task. The problem is very difficult because of the great similarity of the two classes present in the classification. Nevertheless, neural networks were able to recognize and predict about 75% of secondary structures. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

These approaches yield global or class-specific measures of map quality by comparing classification results with independent ground-truth data. In most maps, considerable spatial variation is present in the accuracy of land cover labels that is not captured by these statistics. To date, this issue has rarely been addressed in the land cover remote sensing literature. We present a method to estimate pixel-scale land cover classification confidence using nonparametric machine learning methods. The method is based on recent theoretical developments from the domains of statistics and machine learning that explain the machine learning technique known as "boosting" as being equivalent to additive logistic regression. As a result, results from classification algorithms that use boosting can be assigned classification confidences based on probability estimates assigned to them using this theory. We test this approach using three different data sets. Our results demonstrate that classification errors tend to have low classification confidence while correctly classified pixels tend to have higher confidence. Thus, the method described in this paper may be used as a basis for providing spatially explicit maps of classification quality. This type of information will provide substantial additional information regarding map quality relative to more conventional quality measures and should be useful to end-users of map products derived from remote sensing.

J	Cochinwala, M; Kurien, V; Lalk, G; Shasha, D				Cochinwala, M; Kurien, V; Lalk, G; Shasha, D			Efficient data reconciliation	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article								Data reconciliation is the process of matching records across different databases. Data reconciliation requires "joining" on fields that have traditionally been non-key fields. Generally, the operational databases are of sufficient quality for the purposes for which they were initially designed but since the data in the different databases do not have a canonical structure and may have errors, approximate matching algorithms are required. Approximate matching algorithms can have many different parameter settings. The number of parameters will affect the complexity of the algorithm due to the number of comparisons needed to identify matching records across different datasets. For large datasets that are prevalent in data warehouses, the increased complexity may result in impractical solutions. In this paper, we describe an efficient method for data reconciliation. Our main contribution is the incorporation of machine learning and statistical techniques to reduce the complexity of the matching algorithms via identification and elimination of redundant or useless parameters. We have conducted experiments on actual data that demonstrate the validity of our techniques. In our experiments, the techniques reduced complexity by 50% while significantly increasing matching accuracy. (C) 2001 Telcordia Technologies Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Ware, M; Frank, E; Holmes, G; Hall, M; Witten, IH				Ware, M; Frank, E; Holmes, G; Hall, M; Witten, IH			Interactive machine learning: letting users build classifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						interactive learning; classification; decision trees; visualization		According to standard procedure, building a classifier using machine learning is a fully automated process that follows the preparation of training data by a domain expert. In contrast, interactive machine learning engages users in actually generating the classifier themselves. This offers a natural way of integrating background knowledge into the modelling stage-as long as interactive tools can be designed that support efficient and effective communication. This paper shows that appropriate techniques can empower users to create models that compete with classifiers built by state-of-the-art learning algorithms. It demonstrates that users-even users who are not domain experts-can often construct good classifiers, without any help from a learning algorithm, using a simple two-dimensional visual interface. Experiments on real data demonstrate that, not surprisingly, success hinges on the domain: if a few attributes can support good predictions, users generate accurate classifiers, whereas domains with many high-order attribute interactions favour standard machine learning techniques. We also present an artificial example where domain knowledge allows an "expert user" to create a much more accurate model than automatic learning algorithms. These results indicate that our system has the potential to produce highly accurate classifiers in the hands of a domain expert who has a strong interest in the domain and therefore some insights into how to partition the data. Moreover, small expert-defined models offer the additional advantage that they will generally be more intelligible than those generated by automatic techniques. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Such decision may be supported by utilizing models that predict the patient's outcome. The study described in this paper investigates the possibility to construct patient outcome prediction models from retrospective patient's data at the end of initial damage control surgery by using feature mining and machine learning techniques. As the data used comprises rather excessive number of features, special attention was paid to the problem of selecting only the most relevant features. We show that a small subset of features may carry enough information to construct reasonably accurate prognostic models. Furthermore, the techniques used in our study identified two factors, namely the pH value when admitted to ICU and the worst partial active thromboplastin time, to be of highest importance for prediction. This finding is pathophysiologically reasonable and represents two of three major problems with severe trauma patients, metabolic acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy.

J	Parmanto, B; Deneault, LG; Denault, AY				Parmanto, B; Deneault, LG; Denault, AY			Detection of hemodynamic changes in clinical monitoring by time-delay neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						clinical monitoring; decision support system; machine learning; neural networks; time series	RECOGNITION	Small changes that occur in a patient's physiology over long periods of time are difficult to detect, yet they can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Detecting such changes is even more difficult in intensive care unit (ICU) environments where clinicians are bombarded by a barrage of complex monitoring signals from various devices. Early detection accompanied by appropriate intervention can lead to improvement in patient care. Neural networks can be used as the basis for an intelligent early warning system. We developed time-delay neural networks (TDNN) for classifying and detecting hemodynamic changes. A matrix of physiological parameters were extracted from raw signals collected during cardiovascular experiments in mongrel dogs. These matrices represented several episodes of stable, decreasing, and increasing cardiac filling in normal, exerted, and heart failure conditions. The TDNN were trained with these matrices and subsequently tested to predict unseen cases. The TDNN perform remarkably not only in identifying all hemodynamic conditions, but also in quickly detecting their changes. On average, the networks were able to detect the hemodynamic changes in less than 1 s after the onset. Based on the results of this pilot investigation, the use of this form of TDNN to successfully predict hemodynamic conditions appears to be promising. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

SC provides an attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty); Fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and evolutionary computation (EC) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL. NN, and EC should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary instead. SC has been theoretically developed for the past decade, since L A. Zadeh proposed the concept in the early 1990s. Soft computing is causing a paradigm shift (breakthrough) in engineering and science fields since it can solve problems that have not been able to be solved by traditional analytic methods [tractability (TR)]. In addition, SC yields rich knowledge representation (symbol and pattern), flexible knowledge acquisition (by machine learning from data and by interviewing experts), and flexible knowledge processing (inference by interfacing between symbolic and pattern knowledge), which enable intelligent systems to be constructed at low cost [high machine intelligence quotient (HMIQ)]. This paper reviews applications of SC in several industrial fields to show the various innovations by TR, HMIQ, and low cost in industries that have been made possible by the use of SC. Our paper intends to remove the gap between theory and practice and attempts to learn how to apply soft computing practically to industrial systems from examples/analogy reviewing many application papers.

The proposed process involves an iterative mechanism where type traits are successively defined and computationally represented using knowledge engineering methodologies, scored by a set of trained human experts and finally, analysed by means of four reputed machine learning algorithms. The results thus achieved serve as feed back to the next iteration in order to improve the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed assessment system. A sample of 260 conformation records of the Asturiana de los Valles beef cattle breed is shown to illustrate the methodology. Three sources of inconsistency were detected: (a) the existence of different interpretations of the trait's definition, increasing the subjectivity of the assessment; (b) the narrow range of variation of some of the anatomical traits assessed; (c) the inclusion of some complex traits in the assessment system. In this sense, the reopening of the evaluated Asturiana de los Valles assessment system is recommended. In spite of the difficulty of collecting data from live animals, further implications of the artificial intelligence systems on morphological assessment are pointed out.

The test data consists of 98 Raman spectra of temperate softwoods and hardwoods, and Brazilian and Honduran tropical woods. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to extract features (i.e., line intensities at specific wavelengths) characteristic of the Raman profile of each wood-type. The spectral features identified by the pattern recognition GA allow the wood samples to cluster by type in a plot of the two largest principal components of the data. Because principal components maximize variance, the bulk of the information encoded by these spectral features is about differences between wood types. The predictive ability of the descriptors identified by the pattern recognition GA and the principal component map associated with them is validated using an external prediction set consisting of tropical woods and temperate hard and softwoods.

J	Kononenko, I				Kononenko, I			Machine learning for medical diagnosis: history, state of the art and perspective	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						machine learning; medical diagnosis; reliability of prediction; kirlian camera	NEURAL NETWORKS; DISEASE; SYSTEMS	The paper provides an overview of the development of intelligent data analysis in medicine from a machine learning perspective: a historical view, a state-of-the-art view, and a view on some future trends in this subfield of applied artificial intelligence. The paper is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview but rather describes some subareas and directions which from my personal point of view seem to be important for applying machine learning in medical diagnosis. In the historical overview, I emphasize the naive Bayesian classifier, neural networks and decision trees. I present a comparison of some state-of-the-art systems, representatives from each branch of machine learning, when applied to several medical diagnostic tasks. The future trends are illustrated by two case studies. The first describes a recently developed method for dealing with reliability of decisions of classifiers, which seems to be promising for intelligent data analysis in medicine. The second describes an approach to using machine learning in order to verify some unexplained phenomena from complementary medicine, which is not (yet) approved by the orthodox medical community but could in the future play an important role in overall medical diagnosis and treatment.

J	An, AJ; Cercone, N				An, AJ; Cercone, N			Rule quality measures for rule induction systems: Description and evaluation	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						rule quality measures; rule induction; meta-learning		A rule quality measure is important to a rule induction system for determining when to stop generalization or specialization. Such measures are also important to a rule-based classification procedure for resolving conflicts among rules. We describe a number of statistical and empirical rule quality formulas and present an experimental comparison of these formulas on a number of standard machine learning datasets. We also present a meta-learning method for generating a set of formula-behavior rules from the experimental results which show the relationships between a formula's performance and the characteristics of a dataset. These formula-behavior rules arc combined into formula-selection rules that can be used in a rule induction system to select a rule quality formula before rule induction. We will report the experimental results showing the effects of formula-selection on the predictive performance of a rule induction system.

J	Liu, CN; Zhong, N				Liu, CN; Zhong, N			Rough problem settings for ILP dealing with imperfect data	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						ILP (Inductive Logic Programming); KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases); rough sets; imperfect data	SETS	This paper applies rough set theory to Inductive Logic Programming (I LP, a relatively new method in machine learning) to deal with imperfect data occurring in large real-world applications. We investigate various kinds of imperfect data in ILP and propose rough problem settings to deal with incomplete background knowledge (where essential predicates/clauses are missing), indiscernible data (where some examples belong to both sets of positive and negative training examples), missing classification (where some examples arc unclassified) and too strong declarative bias (hence the failure in searching for solutions). The rough problem settings relax the strict requirements in the standard normal problem setting for ILP, so that rough but useful hypotheses can be induced from imperfect data. We give simple measures of learning quality for the rough problem settings. For other kinds of imperfect data (noise data, too sparse data, missing values, real-valued data, etc.), while referring to their traditional handling techniques, we also point out the possibility of new methods based on rough set theory.

The generic Rough Set Inductive Logic Programming (gRS-ILP) model provides a framework for ILP when the setting is imprecise and any induced logic program will not be able to distinguish between certain positive and negative examples. The gRS-ILP model is extended in this paper to the VPRSILP model by including features of the VPRS model. The VPRSILP model is applied to strings and an illustrative experiment on transmembrane domains in amino acid sequences is presented.

J	Ziarko, W				Ziarko, W			Probabilistic decision tables in the variable precision rough set model	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						rough sets; variable precision rough set model; decision tables; data mining; machine learning		The Variable Precision Rough Set Model (VPRS) is an extension of the original rough set model. This extension is directed towards deriving decision table-based predictive models from data with parametrically adjustable degrees of accuracy. The imprecise nature of such models leads to quite significant modification of the classical notion of decision table. This is accomplished by introducing the idea of approximation region-based, or probabilistic decision table which is a tabular specification of three, in general uncertain, disjunctive decision rules corresponding to rough approximation regions: positive, boundary and negative regions. The focus of the paper is on the extraction of such decision tables from data, their relationship to conjunctive rules and probabilistic assessment of decision confidence with such rules.

J	Wani, MA				Wani, MA			SAFARI: A structured approach for automatic rule induction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						machine learning; pattern classification; rule induction; system identification	ALGORITHM; GENERATION	This paper describes a new algorithm for obtaining rules automatically from training examples. The algorithm is applicable to examples involving both objects with discrete and continuous-valued attributes. The paper explains a new quantization procedure for continuous-valued attributes and shows how appropriate ranges of values of various attributes are obtained. The algorithm uses a decision-tree-based approach for obtaining rules, but unlike other tree-based algorithms such as ID3, it allows more than one attribute at a node which greatly improves its performance. The ability of the algorithm to obtain a measure of partial match further enhances its generalization characteristic. The algorithm produces the same rules irrespective of the order of presentation of training examples. The algorithm has been demonstrated on classification problems. The results have compared favorably with those obtained by existing inductive learning algorithms.

The purpose of fault diagnosis is the isolation of faults on defective systems, a task requiring a high skill set. This has driven the need for automated diagnostic tools. Over the last two decades, automated diagnosis has been an active research area, but the industrial acceptance of these techniques, particularly in cost-sensitive areas, has not been high. This paper reviews this research, primarily covering rule-based, model-based, and case-based approaches and applications. Future research directions are finally examined, with a concentration on issues, which may lead to a greater acceptance of automated diagnosis.

One difficulty in the handling of high-dimensional problems by fuzzy rule-based systems is the exponential increase in the number of fuzzy rules with the number of input variables. Another difficulty is the deterioration in the comprehensibility of fuzzy rules when they involve many antecedent conditions. Our task is to design comprehensible fuzzy rule-based systems with high classification ability. This task is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem with three objectives: to maximize the number of correctly classified training patterns, to minimize the number of fuzzy rules, and to minimize the total number of antecedent conditions. We show two genetic-algorithm-based approaches. One is rule selection where a small number of linguistically interpretable fuzzy rules are selected from a large number of prespecified candidate rules. The other is fuzzy genetics-based machine learning where rule sets are evolved by genetic operations. These two approaches search for non-dominated rule sets with respect to the three objectives.

In this paper we focus on those particular situations where the dataset has incomplete entries, as most real-life datasets have. We present a new approach to tackle this problem. The basic idea is to initially estimate a set of probability intervals that will be used to complete the missing values. Then, these values are used to obtain new bounds of the expected number of entries in the dataset, The probability intervals are narrowed iteratively until convergence, We have shown that the same processes can be used to estimate both, probability intervals and probability distributions, and give conditions that guarantee that the estimator is the correct one.

TC has been an application for many learning approaches. which proved effective. Nevertheless, TC provides many challenges to machine learning. In this paper. we suggest, for text categorization, the integration of external WordNet lexical information to supplement training data for a semi-supervised clustering algorithm which (i) uses a finite design set of labeled data to (ii) help agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms (AHC) partition a finite set of unlabeled data and then (iii) terminates without the capacity to classify other objects. This algorithm is the "semi-supervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm" (ssAHC). Our experiments use Reuters 21578 database and consist of binary classifications for categories selected from the 89 TOPICS classes of the Reuters collection. Using the vector space model (VSM), each document is represented by its original feature vector augmented with external feature vector generated using WordNet. We verify experimentally that the integration of WordNet helps ssAHC improve its performance, effectively addresses the classification of documents into categories with few training documents. and does not interfere with the use of training data.

J	Liu, HF; Lussier, YA; Friedman, C				Liu, HF; Lussier, YA; Friedman, C			Disambiguating ambiguous biomedical terms in biomedical narrative text: An unsupervised method	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						natural language processing; word sense disambiguation; corpus-based machine learning; MedLEE; UMLS; MEDLINE	SPECIAL ISSUE; LANGUAGE	With the growing use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for information extraction and concept indexing in the biomedical domain, a method that quickly and efficiently assigns the correct sense of an ambiguous biomedical term in a given context is needed concurrently. The current status of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in the biomedical domain is that handcrafted rules are used based on contextual material. The disadvantages of this approach are (i) generating WSD rules manually is a time-consuming and tedious task, (ii) maintenance of rule sets becomes increasingly difficult over time, and (iii) handcrafted rules are often incomplete and perform poorly in new domains comprised of specialized vocabularies and different genres of text. This paper presents a two-phase unsupervised method to build a WSD classifier for an ambiguous biomedical term W The first phase automatically creates a sense-tagged corpus for W, and the second phase derives a classifier for W using the derived sense-tagged corpus as a training set. A formative experiment was performed, which demonstrated that classifiers trained on the derived sense-tagged corpora achieved an overall accuracy of about 97%, with greater than 90% accuracy for each individual ambiguous term.

J	Zhong, N; Dong, J; Ohsuga, S				Zhong, N; Dong, J; Ohsuga, S			Using rough sets with heuristics for feature selection	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						feature selection; rough sets; heuristics; inductive learning; knowledge discovery in databases		Practical machine learning algorithms are known to degrade in performance (prediction accuracy) when faced with many features (sometimes attribute is used instead of feature) that are not necessary for rule discovery. To cope with this problem, many methods for selecting a subset of features have been proposed. Among such methods, the filter approach that selects a feature subset using a preprocessing step, and the wrapper approach that selects an optimal feature subset from the space of possible subsets of features using the induction algorithm itself as a part of the evaluation function, are two typical ones. Although the filter approach is a faster one, it has some blindness and the performance of induction is not considered. On the other hand, the optimal feature subsets can be obtained by using the wrapper approach, but it is not easy to use because of the complexity of time and space. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which is using rough set theory with greedy heuristics for feature selection. Selecting features is similar to the filter approach, but the evaluation criterion is related to the performance of induction. That is, we select the features that do not damage the performance of induction.

J	Barber, B; Hamilton, HJ				Barber, B; Hamilton, HJ			Parametric algorithms for mining share frequent itemsets	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge discovery; data mining; itemsets; association rule mining; share based measures		Itemset share, the fraction of some numerical total contributed by items when they occur in itemsets, has been proposed as a measure of the importance of itemsets in association rule mining. The IAB and CAC algorithms are able to find share frequent itemsets that have infrequent subsets. These algorithms perform well, but they do not always find all possible share frequent itemsets. In this paper, we describe the incorporation of a threshold factor into these algorithms. The threshold factor can be used to increase the number of frequent itemsets found at a cost of an increase in the number of infrequent itemsets examined. The modified algorithms are tested on a large commercial database. Their behavior is examined using principles of classifier evaluation from machine learning.

Noise in the training instances will, however, confuse a learning mechanism. Two main steps are adopted here to solve this problem. The first step is to appropriately arrange the training order of the instances. It is well known from Psychology that different orders of presentation of the same set of training instances to a human may cause different learning results. This idea is used here for machine learning and an order arrangement scheme is proposed. The second step is to modify a conventional noise-free learning algorithm, thus making it suitable for noisy environment. The generalized version space learning algorithm is then adopted to process the training instances for deriving good concepts. Finally, experiments on the Iris Flower problem show that the new scheme can produce a good training order, allowing the generalized version space algorithm to have a satisfactory learning result.

The key factor of this supporting tool development was the two-phase methodology used to acquire and fix the knowledge into the knowledge base. Both phases of the methodology are presented in the paper; the first consists of literature reviews and Bite interviews with domain experts, while the second is based on machine learning tools and is subdivided into four steps: data handling, classification, interpretation, and codification. The aim of this two-phase methodology is meant to ease the knowledge acquisition process. The main objective is to find the relevant issues and then reduce the space of search according to the target facility. Also, this methodology allowed the user to explore the data space to discover, if any exist, new pieces of knowledge. This methodology can be generalized to acquire specific knowledge from any (bio)chemical process, improving the development process and the efficiency of the supervisory knowledge-based system.

J	Stambuk, N; Konjevoda, P				Stambuk, N; Konjevoda, P			New computational algorithm for the prediction of protein folding types	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY			English	Article						protein folding; secondary structure prediction; genetic code; error-correcting; Gray code	SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; GENETIC-CODE; MINIMIZATION; SEQUENCES; HISTORY; MODEL	We present a new computational algorithm for the prediction of a secondary protein structure. The method enables the evaluation of alpha- and beta -protein folding types from the nucleotide sequences. The procedure is based on the reflected Gray code algorithm of nucleotide-amino acid relationships, and represents the extension of Swanson's procedure in Ref. [4]. It is shown that six-digit binary notation of each codon enables the prediction of alpha- and beta -protein folds by means of the error-correcting linear block triple-check code. We tested the validity of the method on the test set of 140 proteins (70 alpha- and 70 beta -folds). The test set consisted of standard alpha- and B-protein classes from Jpred and SCOP databases, with nucleotide sequence available in the GenBank database. 100% accurate classification of alpha- and beta -protein folds, based on 39 dipeptide addresses derived by the error-correcting coding procedure was obtained by means of the logistic regression analysis (p < 0.00000001). Classification tree and machine learning sequential minimal optimization (SMO) classifier confirmed the results by means 97.1% and 90% accurate classification, respectively. Protein fold prediction quality tested by means of leave-one-out cross-Validation was a satisfactory 82.1% for the logistic regression and 81.4% for the SMO classifier. The presented procedure of computational analysis can be helpful in detecting the type of protein folding from the newly sequenced exon regions. The method enables quick, simple, and accurate prediction of alpha- and beta -protein folds from the nucleotide sequence on a personal computer. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Recently Eiter and Mannila have proposed a new measure which is computable in polynomial time. However, it is not a distance function in the mathematical sense because it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. We introduce a new measure which is a metric while being computable in polynomial time. We also present a variant which computes a normalised metric and a variant which can associate different weights with the points in the set.

We start with S-CART, a tree induction algorithm, and study various ways of transforming it into a learner for ordinal classification tasks. These algorithm variants are compared on a number of benchmark data sets to verify the relative strengths and weaknesses of the strategies and to study the trade-off between optimal categorical classification accuracy (hit rate) and minimum distance-based error. Preliminary results indicate that this is a promising avenue towards algorithms that combine aspects of classification and regression.

J	Elomaa, T; Rousu, J				Elomaa, T; Rousu, J			On the computational complexity of optimal multisplitting	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS)	OCT 11-14, 2000	CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA			machine learning; splitting criteria; optimal multisplits; computational complexity	ATTRIBUTES; ALGORITHM	The need to partition or discretize numeric value ranges arises in machine learning and data mining algorithms. This subtask is a potential time.-consumption bottleneck, since the number of candidate partitions is exponential in the number of possible cut points in the range. Thus, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for this task. Recently, the efficiency of optimal multisplitting has improved dramatically, due to the introduction of linear-time algorithms for training error minimization and quadratic-time generic algorithms. Whether these efficient algorithms are the best obtainable, is not yet known. In this paper, we probe the inherent complexity of the multisplitting problem. We reflect results obtained for similar problems in computational geometry and string matching to the multisplitting task, Subquadratic optimization algorithms in computational geometry rely on the monotonicity of the optimized function. We show by counterexamples that the widely used evaluation functions Training Set Error and Average Class Entropy do not satisfy the kind of monotonicity that facilitates subquadratic-time optimization. However, we also show that the Training Set Error function can be decomposed into monotonic subproblems, one per class, which explains its linear time optimization. Finally, we review recently developed techniques for speeding up optimal multisplitting.

J	Puuronen, S; Tsymbal, A				Puuronen, S; Tsymbal, A			Local feature selection with dynamic integration of classifiers	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS)	OCT 11-14, 2000	CHARLOTTE, NC			feature selection; ensemble of classifiers; dynamic integration; data mining; machine learning	ALGORITHMS	Multidimensional data is often feature space heterogeneous so that individual features have unequal importance in different sub areas of the feature space. This motivates to search for a technique that provides a strategic splitting of the instance space being able to identify the best subset of features for each instance to be classified. Our technique applies the wrapper approach where a classification algorithm is used as an evaluation function to differentiate between different feature subsets. In order to make the feature selection local, we apply the recent technique for dynamic integration of classifiers. This allows to determine which classifier and which feature subset should be used for each new instance. Decision trees are used to help to restrict the number of feature combinations analyzed. For each new instance we consider only those feature combinations that include the features present in the path taken by the new instance in the decision tree built on the whole feature set. We evaluate our technique on data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. In our experiments, we use the C4.5 algorithm as the learning algorithm for base classifiers and for the decision trees that guide the local feature selection. The experiments show some advantages of the local feature selection with dynamic integration of classifiers in comparison with the selection of one feature subset for the whole space.

Equally importantly, if these alternative approaches perform better, why? And how do they stack up relative to each other? The answers to these questions are significant for predictive modeling in the financial arena, and in general for problem domains characterized by significant nonlinearities. In this paper, we compare the four above-mentioned nonlinear methods along a number of criteria. The genetic algorithm turns out to have some advantages in finding multiple "small disjunct" patterns that can be accurate and collectively capable of making predictions more often than its competitors. We use some of the nonlinearities we discovered about the problem domain to explain these results.

J	Dibike, YB; Velickov, S; Solomatine, D; Abbott, MB				Dibike, YB; Velickov, S; Solomatine, D; Abbott, MB			Model induction with support vector machines: Introduction and applications	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The rapid advance in information processing systems in recent decades had directed engineering research towards the development of intelligent systems that can evolve models of natural phenomena automatically-"by themselves," so to speak. In this respect, a wide range of machine learning techniques like decision trees, artificial neural networks (ANNs), Bayesian methods, fuzzy-rule based systems, and evolutionary algorithms have been successfully applied to model different civil engineering systems. In this study, the possibility of using yet another machine learning paradigm that is firmly based on the theory of statistical learning, namely that of the support vector machine (SVM), is investigated. An interesting property of this approach is that it is an approximate implementation of a structural risk minimization (SRM) induction principle that aims at minimizing a bound on the generalization error of a model, rather than minimizing only the mean square error over the data set. In this paper, the basic ideas underlying statistical learning theory and SVM are reviewed, and the potential of the SVM for feature classification and multiple regression (modeling) problems is demonstrated by applying the method to two different cases of model induction from empirical data. The relative performance of the SVM is then analyzed by comparing its results with that of ANNs on the same data sets.

J	Surmann, H; Maniadakis, M				Surmann, H; Maniadakis, M			Learning feed-forward and recurrent fuzzy systems: A genetic approach	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						fuzzy logic controller; recurrent fuzzy systems; genetic algorithm; entropy of fuzzy rule; machine learning; dynamic processes	MOBILE ROBOT; ALGORITHM; IDENTIFICATION; CONTROLLERS	In this paper, we present a new learning method for rule-based feed-forward and recurrent fuzzy systems. Recurrent fuzzy systems have hidden fuzzy variables and can approximate the temporal relation embedded in dynamic processes of unknown order. The learning method is universal i.e., it selects optimal width and position of Gaussian like membership functions and it selects a minimal set of fuzzy rules as well as the structure of the rules. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to estimate the fuzzy systems which capture low complexity and minimal rule base. Optimization of the "entropy" of a fuzzy rule base leads to a minimal number of rules, of membership functions and of subpremises together with an optimal input/output (I/O) behavior. Most of the resulting fuzzy systems are comparable to systems designed by an expert but offers a better performance. The approach is compared to others by a standard benchmark (a system identification process). Different results for feed-forward and first-order recurrent fuzzy systems with symmetric and non-symmetric membership functions are presented, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fisekovic, N; Popovic, DB				Fisekovic, N; Popovic, DB			New controller for functional electrical stimulation systems	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						controller; electronic stimulator; walking; rule-based control	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; GAIT; MUSCLE; LOCOMOTION; FES	A novel, self-contained controller for functional electrical stimulation systems has been designed. The development was motivated P by the need to have a general purpose, easy to use controller capable of stimulating many muscle groups, thus restoring complex motor functions (e.g. standing, walking, reaching, and grasping). The designed controller can regulate the frequency, pulse duration, and charge balance on up to 16 channels, and execute pre-programmed and sensory-driven control operations. The controller supports up to eight analog and six digital sensors, and comprises a memory block for including history of the sensory data (time series). Five independent timers provide the basis for the multi-modal and multi-level control of movement. The PC compatible interface is realised via an IR serial communication channel. The PC based software is user friendly and fully menu driven. This paper also presents a case study where the controller was implemented to restore walking in a paraplegic subject. The assistive system comprised the novel controller, the power and output stages of an eight-channel FES system (IEEE Trans Rehabil Eng, TRE-2 (1994) 234), ankle-foot orthoses, and a rolling walker. Stimulation was applied with surface electrodes positioned over the motoneurons that innervate muscles responsible for the hip and knee flexion and extension. The sensory system included goniometers at knee and hip joints, force-sensing resistors built in the shoe insoles, and digital accelerometers at the hips. A rule-based control algorithm was generated following a two-step procedure: (1) simulation and (2) machine learning as described in earlier studies (IEEE Trans Rehab Eng, TRE-7 (1999) 69). The paraplegic subject walked faster, and with less physiological effort, when automatic control was applied as compared to hand-control. This case study, as well as a previous one for assisting grasping (The design and testing of a new programmable electronic stimulator. N. Fisekovic, MS thesis. University of Belgrade, Belgrade, 2000) indicate that the novel control unit is effectively applicable to FES systems. (C) 2001 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current sources may be modeled as dipoles. The properties of the current dipole sources may be studied by solving either the forward or in verse problems. The forward problem utilizes a volume conductor model for the head, in which the potentials on the conductor surface are computed based on an assumed current dipole at an arbitrary location, orientation, and strength. In the inverse problem, on the other hand, a current dipole, or a group of dipoles, is identified based on the observed EEG. Both the forward and inverse problems are typically solved by numerical procedures, such as a boundary element method and an optimization algorithm. These approaches are highly time-consuming and unsuitable for the rapid evaluation of brain function. in this paper we present a different approach to these problems based on machine learning. We solve both problems using artificial neural networks which are trained off-line using back-propagation techniques to learn the complex source-potential relationships of head volume conduction. Once trained, these networks are able to generalize their knowledge to localize functional activity within the brain in a computationally efficient manner.

For each protein this includes information about cloning, expression, purification, biophysical characterization and structure determination via NMR spectroscopy or X-ray crystallography. It will be essential to develop specifications and ontologies for standardizing this information to make it amenable to retrospective analysis. To this end we created the SPINE database and analysis system for the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. SPINE, which is available at bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/nesg or nesg.org, is specifically designed to enable distributed scientific collaboration via the Internet. It was designed not just as an information repository but as an active vehicle to standardize proteomics data in a form that would enable systematic data mining. The system features an intuitive user interface for interactive retrieval and modification of expression construct data, query forms designed to track global project progress and external links to many other resources. Currently the database contains experimental data on 985 constructs, of which 740 are drawn from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, 123 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 93 from Caenorhabditis elegans and the remainder from other organisms. We developed a comprehensive set of data mining features for each protein, including several related to experimental progress (e.g. expression level, solubility and crystallization) and 42 based on the underlying protein sequence (e.g. amino acid composition, secondary structure and occurrence of low complexity regions). We demonstrate in detail the application of a particular machine learning approach, decision trees, to the tasks of predicting a protein's solubility and propensity to crystallize based on sequence features. We are able to extract a number of key rules from our trees, in particular that soluble proteins tend to have significantly more acidic residues and fewer hydrophobic stretches than insoluble ones. One of the characteristics of proteomics data sets, currently and in the foreseeable future, is their intermediate size (similar to 500-5000 data points). This creates a number of issues in relation to error estimation. Initially we estimate the overall error in our trees based on standard cross-validation. However, this leaves out a significant fraction of the data in model construction and does not give error estimates on individual rules. Therefore, we present alternative methods to estimate the error in particular rules.

J	Lavine, BK; Brzozowski, D; Moores, AJ; Davidson, CE; Mayfield, HT				Lavine, BK; Brzozowski, D; Moores, AJ; Davidson, CE; Mayfield, HT			Genetic algorithm for fuel spill identification	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						fuel spill identification; genetic algorithm; pattern recognition analysis; feature selection; machine learning; fingerprint data	PATTERN-RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES; SPEED GAS CHROMATOGRAMS	Gas chromatography is frequently used to fingerprint fuel spills, with the gas chromatograms of the spill sample and the different candidate fuels compared visually in order to seek a best match. However, visual analysis of gas chromatograms is subjective and is not always persuasive in a court of law. Pattern recognition methods offer a better approach to the problem of matching gas chromatograms of weathered fuels. Pattern recognition methods involve less subjectivity in the interpretation of the data and are capable of identifying fingerprint patterns within gas chromatographic (GC) data characteristic of fuel-type, even if the fuel samples comprising the training set have been subjected to a variety of conditions. In this paper, We report on the development of a genetic algorithm (GA) for pattern recognition analysis of GC fuel spill data. The pattern recognition GA incorporates aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computations to yield a "smart" one-pass procedure for feature selection. Its efficacy is demonstrated by way of two studies recently completed in our laboratory on fuel spill identification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Carse, B; Oreland, J				Carse, B; Oreland, J			Evolution and learning in neural networks: Dynamic correlation, relearning and thresholding	ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR			English	Article						genetic algorithm; machine learning; neural networks		This contribution revisits an earlier discovered observation that the average performance of a population of neural networks that are evolved to solve one task is improved by lifetime learning on a different task. Two extant, and very different, explanations of this phenomenon are examined dynamic correlation, and relearning. Experimental results are presented which suggest that neither of these hypotheses can fully explain the phenomenon. A new explanation of the effect is proposed and empirically justified. This explanation is based on the fact that in these, and many other related studies, real-valued neural network outputs are thresholded to provide discrete actions. The effect of such thresholding produces a particular type of fitness landscape in which lifetime learning can reduce the deleterious effects of mutation, and therefore increase mean population fitness.

J	Potter, S; Darlington, MJ; Culley, SJ; Chawdhry, PK				Potter, S; Darlington, MJ; Culley, SJ; Chawdhry, PK			Design synthesis knowledge and inductive machine learning	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						conceptual design; design synthesis; inductive machine learning; heuristic knowledge	SPECIAL-ISSUE	A crucial early stage in the engineering design process is the conceptual design phase, during which an initial solution design is generated. The quality of this initial design has a great bearing on the quality and success of the produced artefact. Typically, the knowledge required to perform this task is only acquired through many years of experience, and so is often at a premium. This has led to a number of attempts to automate this phase using intelligent computer systems. However, the knowledge of how to generate designs has proved difficult to acquire directly from human experts, and as a result, is often unsatisfactory in these systems. The application of inductive machine learning techniques to the acquisition of this sort of knowledge has been advocated as one approach to overcoming the difficulties surrounding its capture. Rather than acquiring the knowledge from human experts, the knowledge would be inferred automatically from a set of examples of the design process. This paper describes the authors' investigations into the general viability of this approach in the context of one particular conceptual design task, that of the design of fluid power circuits. The analysis of a series of experiments highlights a number of issues that would seem to arise regardless of the working domain or particular machine learning algorithm used. These issues, presented and discussed here, cast serious doubts upon the practicality of such an approach to knowledge acquisition, given the current state of the art.

The problem of this method is that the performance of these rules depends on the state the system is in at each moment, and no single rule exists that is better than the rest in all the possible states: that the system may be in. It would therefore be interesting to use the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment. To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach which uses machine learning can be used. Analyzing the previous performance of the system (training examples) by means of this technique, knowledge is obtained that can be used to decide which is the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment in time. In this paper, a review of the main machine learning-based scheduling approaches described in the literature is presented.

A case study using intensive care unit patients data	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						supervised classification; machine learning; stacked generalization; Bayesian networks; genetic algorithms; 10-fold cross-validation	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; COMBINATION; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Combining the predictions of a set of classifiers has shown to be an effective way to create composite classifiers that are more accurate than any of the component classifiers. There are many methods for combining the predictions given by component classifiers. We introduce a new method that combine a number of component classifiers using a Bayesian network as a classifier system given the component classifiers predictions. Component classifiers are standard machine learning classification algorithms, and the Bayesian network structure is learned using a generic algorithm that searches for the structure that maximises the classification accuracy given the predictions of the component classifiers. Experimental results have been obtained on a datafile of cases containing information about ICU patients at Canary Islands University Hospital. The accuracy obtained using the presented new approach statistically improve those obtained using standard machine learning methods. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We do this by means of experiments involving the task of morphosyntactic word class tagging, on the basis of three different tagged corpora, Four well-known tagger generators (hidden Markov model, memory-based, transformation rules, and maximum entropy) are trained on the same corpus data. After comparison, their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second-stage classifiers. All combination taggers outperform their best component. The reduction in error rate varies with the material in question, but can be as high as 24.3% with the LOB corpus.

J	Sumathi, S; Sivanandam, SN; Balachandar				Sumathi, S; Sivanandam, SN; Balachandar			Design and development of self-organised neural network schemes as a data mining tool	ENGINEERING INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Adaptive Resonance Theory1 (ART1); ART2; fuzzy ART; pruning; rule extraction; rule validation	ARTMAP; CLASSIFICATION	Information and energy are at the core of everything around us. Our entire existence is a process of gathering, analyzing, understanding and acting on the information. For many applications dealing with large amount of data, Pattern classification is a key element in arriving at the solution. Engineering applications like SONAR, RADAR, SEISMIC and medical diagnosis require the ability to accurately classify the recorded data for controlling, tracking and decision making respectively. Although modern technologies enable storage of large streams of data, we do not yet have a technology to help us to understand, analyze, or even visualize the hidden information in the data. Data Mining is now the emerging field attracting all research communities. Pattern classification is one particular category of Data Mining, which enables the Discovery of Knowledge from Very Large Databases (VLDB). Modern developments in hardware and software technologies have paved way for developing the software for analyzing and visualizing the data. This development is based on the application of data mining concept. Artificial Neural Networks are used to mine the data base which has better noise immunity and lesser training time. The paper aims mainly at classification accuracy with reduction in learning time using self-organizing neural networks. The newness in the concept of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) makes this as the best and efficient approach for classification. In the first phase, the ART1 network was constructed. The pruning phase aims at removing redundant links and units without increasing the classification error rate of the network. The final phase extracts the classification rules from the final weights of the pruned network in the form of IF-THEN rules. Finally the extracted rules have been validated for its correctness. The rule extraction process of ART network is simple compared to BPN rule extraction process. Moreover the rules extracted from this network is also very simple compared tp BPN approach. This approach is most widely used in the Medical industry for correct prediction of patients when the database is so large. The performance evaluation all the networks namely, ART1, ART2 and Fuzzy ART have been done and compared with conventional methods. Simulation is carried out using the medical data bases taken from the UCI repository of machine learning data bases.

J	Castillo, L; Gonzalez, A; Perez, R				Castillo, L; Gonzalez, A; Perez, R			Including a simplicity criterion in the selection of the best rule in a genetic fuzzy learning algorithm	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; fuzzy rules; genetic algorithms	LOGIC-CONTROLLER; CLASSIFICATION	Learning algorithms can obtain very useful descriptions of several problems. Many different alternative descriptions can be generated. In many cases, a simple description is preferable since it has a higher possibility of being valid in unseen cases and also it is usually easier to understand by a human expert. Thus, the main idea of this paper is to propose simplicity criteria and to include them in a learning algorithm. In this case, the learning algorithm will reward the simplest descriptions. We study simplicity criteria in the selection of fuzzy rules in the genetic fuzzy learning algorithm called SLAVE. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gonzalez, A; Perez, R				Gonzalez, A; Perez, R			Selection of relevant features in a fuzzy genetic learning algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						feature selection; fuzzy rules; genetic algorithms (GAs); machine learning	EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS; LOGIC-CONTROLLER; CLASSIFICATION; EXAMPLES; SYSTEMS	Genetic algorithms offer a powerful search method for a variety of learning tasks, and there are different approaches in which they have been applied to learning processes. Structural learning algorithm on vague environment (SLAVE) is a genetic learning algorithm that uses the iterative approach to learn fuzzy rules. SLAVE can select the relevant features of the domain, but when working with large databases the search space is too large and the running time can sometimes be excessive. We propose to improve SLAVE by including a feature selection model in which the genetic algorithm works with individuals (representing individual rules) composed of two structures: one structure representing the relevance status of the involved variables in the rule, the other one representing the assignments variable/value. For this general representation, we study two alternatives depending on the information coded in the first structure. When compared with the initial algorithm, this neu approach of SLAVE reduces the number of rules, simplifies the structure of the rules and improves the total accuracy.

The work presented here builds upon previous work on artificial immune systems (AIS) for data analysis. A population control mechanism, inspired by the natural immune system, has been introduced to control population growth and allow termination of the learning algorithm. The new algorithm is presented, along with the immunological metaphors used as inspiration. Results are presented for Fisher Iris data set, where very successful results are obtained in identifying clusters within the data set. It is argued that this new resource-based mechanism is a large step forward in making AISs a viable contender for effective unsupervised machine learning and allows for not just a one shot learning mechanism, but a continual learning model to be developed.

J	Shigaki, I; Narazaki, H				Shigaki, I; Narazaki, H			An approximate summarization method of process data for acquiring knowledge to improve product quality	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL			English	Article						machine learning; knowledge acquisition; ID3 method		This paper describes a machine learning approach for a manufacturing database. The method is presented in the Nb-Ti superconducting wire domain. A Nb-Ti superconducting wire is produced by iterating the drawing and heat treatment operations. The purpose is to obtain approximate summarization of process data that describes how a production schedule can be improved for better product quality. The method consists of the following steps: First, der ne a ranking function for a production schedule. Then, generate `positive' and `negative' instances for improving a production schedule by comparing a pair of schedules and their ranking values in the database. Using a machine learning technique, called `ID3', a `modification patterns' are obtained that generalize the data for better production quality. The final step is to extract approximate information from the induced patterns, which is both desirable for easier understanding by human experts and necessary to avoid being too much influenced by excessive details or disturbances. Two criteria are proposed, correctness and applicability indices, for this approximation.

A key bottleneck in building such systems has been the laborious manual construction of semantic mappings between the source schemas and the mediated schema. We describe LSD, a system that employs and extends current machine-learning techniques to semi-automatically find such mappings. LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings together with the sources to train a set of learners. Each learner exploits a different type of information either in the source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been trained, LSD finds semantic mappings for a new data source by applying the learners, then combining their predictions using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accuracy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD can incorporate domain constraints as:an additional source of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the structural information in XML documents. Our approach thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to additional learners that may exploit new kinds of information. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains, and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings with a high degree of accuracy.

J	Shiu, SCK; Yeung, DS; Sun, CH; Wang, XZ				Shiu, SCK; Yeung, DS; Sun, CH; Wang, XZ			Transferring case knowledge to adaptation knowledge: An approach for case-base maintenance	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						case-base maintenance; knowledge containers; fuzzy decision trees	FUZZY	In this article we propose a case-base maintenance methodology based on the idea of transferring knowledge between knowledge containers in a case-based reasoning (CBR) system. A machine-learning technique, fuzzy decision-tree induction, is used to transform the case knowledge to adaptation knowledge. By learning the more sophisticated fuzzy adaptation knowledge, many of the redundant cases can be removed. This approach is particularly useful when the case base consists of a large number of redundant cases and the retrieval efficiency becomes a real concern of the user. The method of maintaining a case base from scratch, as proposed in this article, consists of four steps. First, an approach to learning feature weights automatically is used to evaluate the importance of different features in a given case base. Second, clustering of cases is carried out to identify different concepts in the case base using the acquired feature-weights knowledge. Third, adaptation rules are mined for each concept using fuzzy decision trees. Fourth, a selection strategy based on the concepts of case coverage and reachability is used to select representative cases. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach as well as to examine the relationship between compactness and performance of a CBR system, experimental testing is carried out using the Traveling and the Rice Taste data sets. The results show that the testing case bases can be reduced by 36 and 39 percent, respectively, if we complement the remaining cases by the adaptation rules discovered using our approach. The overall accuracies of the two smaller case bases are 94 and 90 percent, respectively, of the originals.

We estimated a concordance of 57% between the overall rodent carcinogenicity classifications from both sources. This value did not improve substantially when additional biologic information (species, sex, strain, target organs) was considered. These results indicate that rodent carcinogenicity assays are much less reproducible than previously expected, an effect that should be considered in the development of structure-activity relationship models and the risk assessment process.

J	Birney, E				Birney, E			Hidden Markov models in biological sequence analysis	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							PROTEIN; PREDICTION	The vast increase of data in biology has meant that many aspects of computational science have been drawn into the field. Two areas of crucial importance are large-scale data management and machine learning. The field between computational science and biology is varyingly described as "computational biology" or "bioinformatics." This paper reviews machine learning techniques based on the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for investigating biomolecular sequences. The approach is illustrated with brief descriptions of gene-prediction HMMs and protein family HMMs.	European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England	Birney, E (reprint author), European Bioinformat Inst, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England.

J	Liu, JNK; Li, BNL; Dillon, TS				Liu, JNK; Li, BNL; Dillon, TS			An improved Naive Bayesian classifier technique coupled with a novel input solution method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						data mining; genetic algorithm (GA); improved Naive Bayes classification (INCB); rainfall prediction	FUZZY	Data mining is the study of how to determine underlying patterns in the data to help make optimal decisions on computers when the database involved is voluminous, hard to characterize accurately, and constantly changing. It deploys techniques based on machine learning, alongside the conventional methods. More importantly, these techniques can generate decision or prediction models, based on the actual historical data. Therefore, they represent true evidence-based decision support. Rainfall prediction is a good problem to solve by these data mining techniques. This paper proposes an improved Naive Bayes classifier (INCB) technique and explores the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) for selection of a subset of input features in classification problems. It then carries out a comparison with several other techniques. It sets a comparison of the following algorithms, namely: 1) genetic algorithm with average classification or general classification (GA-AC, GA-C), 2) C4.5 with pruning, and 3) INBC with relative frequency or initial probability density (INBC-RF, INBC-IPD) on the real meteorological data in Hong Kong. Two simple schemes are proposed to construct a suitable data set for improving the performance. Scheme I uses all basic input parameters for rainfall prediction. Scheme II uses the optimal subset of input variables which are selected by a GA. The results show that among the methods we compared, INBC achieved about 90% accuracy rate on the rain/no-rain (Rain) classification problems. This method also attained reasonable performance on rainfall prediction with three-level depth (Depth3) and five-level depth (Depth5), which are around 65%-70%.

J	Becker, H				Becker, H			Computing with words and machine learning in medical diagnostics	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article							FUZZY	The paper deals with the mathematical simulation of empirical learning in medical diagnostics. Such a simulation essentially amounts to solving both the problem of how to acquire, represent, and objectify the smallest typical units of diagnostic knowledge and the problem of how to identify the subject-specific situations in which diagnostic learning may take place at all. A solution to the first question will be provided by using so called fuzzy probabilities as a model. The second problem is solved by adequately formalizing that kind of knowledge as it is found in standard sources like textbooks for instance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Draghici, S				Draghici, S			The constraint based decomposition (CBD) training architecture	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article							FEEDFORWARD NEURAL-NETWORKS; CASCADE-CORRELATION ALGORITHM; CONSTRUCTIVE ALGORITHMS; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; INITIALIZATION; PERCEPTRONS	The Constraint Based Decomposition (CBD) is a constructive neural network technique that builds a three or four layer network, has guaranteed convergence and can deal with binary, n-ary, class labeled and real-value problems. CBD is shown to be able to solve complicated problems in a simple, fast and reliable manner. The technique is further enhanced by two modifications (locking detection and redundancy elimination) which address the training speed and the efficiency of the internal representation built by the network. The redundancy elimination aims at building more compact architectures while the locking detection aims at improving the training speed. The computational cost of the redundancy elimination is negligible and this enhancement can be used for any problem. However, the computational cost of the locking detection is exponential in the number of dimensions and should only be used in low dimensional spaces. The experimental results show the performance of the algorithm presented in a series of classical benchmark problems including the a-spiral problem and the Iris, Wine, Glass, Lenses, Ionosphere, Lung cancer, Pima Indians, Bupa, TicTacToe, Balance and Zoo data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. CBD's generalization accuracy is compared with that of C4.5, C4.5 with rules, incremental decision trees, oblique classifiers, linear machine decision trees. CN2, learning vector quantization (LVQ), backpropagation, nearest neighbor, Q* and radial basis functions (RBFs). CBD provides the second best average accuracy on the problems tested as well as the best reliability (the lowest standard deviation). (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Hua, SJ; Sun, ZR				Hua, SJ; Sun, ZR			A novel method of protein secondary structure prediction with high segment overlap measure: Support vector machine approach	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						protein structure prediction; protein secondary structure; support vector machine; supervised learning; the tertiary classifier	MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS; IDENTIFICATION; DATABASE; ACCURATE; NETWORKS	We have introduced a new method of protein secondary structure prediction which is based on the theory of support vector machine (SVM). SVM represents a new approach to supervised pattern classification which has been successfully applied to a wide range of pattern recognition problems, including object recognition, speaker identification, gene function prediction with microarray expression profile, etc. Ln these cases, the performance of SVM either matches or is significantly better than that of traditional machine learning approaches, including neural networks. The first use of the SVM approach to predict protein secondary structure is described here. Unlike the previous studies, we first constructed several binary classifiers, then assembled a tertiary classifier for three secondary structure states (helix, sheet and coil) based on these binary classifiers. The SVM method achieved a good performance of segment overlap accuracy SOV = 76.2 % through sevenfold cross validation on a database of 513 non-homologous protein chains with multiple sequence alignments, which out-performs existing methods. Meanwhile three-state overall per-residue accuracy Q(3) achieved 73.5%, which is at least comparable to existing single prediction methods. Furthermore a useful "reliability index" for the predictions was developed, hn addition, SVM has many attractive features, including effective avoidance of overfitting, the ability to handle large feature spaces, information condensing of the given data set, etc. The SVM method is conveniently applied to many ether pattern classification tasks in biology.

Part 1 of this review explored applications of fuzzy, multivariate statistical and fractal methods to gait data analysis. Part 2 extends this critical review to the applications of artificial neural networks and wavelets to gait data analysis. The review concludes with a practical guide to the selection of alternative gait data analysis methods. Neural networks are found to be the most prevalent non-traditional methodology for gait data analysis in the last 10 years.

We adopt a mathematical feature extraction procedure to construct the featured knowledge database from all the suspicious mass sites localized by the enhanced segmentation. The optimal mapping of the data points is then obtained by learning the generalized normal mixtures and decision boundaries, where a is developed to carry out both soft and hard clustering, A visual explanation of the decision making is further invented as a decision support, based on an interactive visualization hierarchy through the probabilistic principal component projections of the knowledge database and the localized optimal displays of the retrieved raw data. A prototype system is developed and pilot tested to demonstrate the applicability of this framework to mammographic mass detection.

J	Mohan, A; Papageorgiou, C; Poggio, T				Mohan, A; Papageorgiou, C; Poggio, T			Example-based object detection in images by components	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						object detection; people detection; pattern recognition; machine learning; components	HUMAN FACE DETECTION; RECOGNITION; TEMPLATES	In this paper, we present a general example-based framework for detecting objects in static images by components. The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head. legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a "person" or a "nonperson." We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an Adaptive Combination of Classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded Views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background.

J	Shmulevich, I; Gabbouj, M; Astola, J				Shmulevich, I; Gabbouj, M; Astola, J			Complexity of the consistency problem for certain post classes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						computational complexity; computational learning theory; consistency problem; monotone Boolean function; post class		The complexity of the consistency problem for several important classes of Boolean functions is analyzed. The classes of functions under investigation are those which are closed under function composition or superposition. Several of these so-called Post classes are considered within the context of machine learning with an application to breast cancer diagnosis. The considered Post classes furnish a user-selectable measure of reliability. It is shown that for realistic situations which may arise in practice, the consistency problem for these classes of functions is polynomial-time solvable.

INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL REVIEW			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	52nd Session of the ISI	AUG, 1999	HELSINKI, FINLAND	ISI		data analysis; data mining; decision support; computational statistics		The nature of data is rapidly changing. Data sets are becoming increasingly large and complex Modern methodology for analyzing these new types of data are emerging from the fields of Data Base Management, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, and Data Visualization, So far Statistics as a held has played a minor role. This paper explores some of the reasons for this, and why statisticians should have an interest in participating in the development of new methods for large and complex data sets.

This claim is investigated here for a particular application in structural molecular biology, that of constructing readable descriptions of the major protein folds. To the authors' knowledge Machine Learning has not previously been applied systematically to this task. In this application, the domain expert (third author) identified a natural divide between essentially propositional features and more structurally-oriented relational ones. The following null hypotheses are tested: 1) for a given ILP system (Progol) provision of relational background knowledge does not increase predictive accuracy, 2) a good propositional learning system (C5.0) without relational background knowledge will outperform Progol with relational background knowledge, 3) relational background knowledge does not produce improved explanatory insight. Null hypotheses 1) and 2) are both refuted on cross-validation results carried out over 20 of the most populated protein folds. Hypothesis 3 is refuted by demonstration of various insightful rules discovered only in the relationally-oriented learned rules.

First, a language bias for word se mentation is introduced and a simple genetic algorithm is used in the search for a segmentation that corresponds to the best bias value. In the second phase, the words segmented by the genetic algorithm are used as an input for the first order decision list learner CLOG. The result is a set of first order rules which can be used for segmentation of unseen words. When applied on either the training data or unseen data, these rules produce segmentations which are linguistically meaningful, and to a large degree conforming to the annotation provided.

Using existing data on the deer population spatial distribution and size, as well as data on the landscape and ecological properties (GIS) of the area inhabited by this population, we develop a habitat suitability model by automated data analysis using machine learning of classification trees. We assume that the recorded observations of deer approximate the actual spatial distribution of the deer population reasonably well. The habitat suitability models for individual animals have the form of classification trees. The induced trees are interpreted by domain experts and a generic model is proposed. The generic habitat suitability models can help determine potential unoccupied habitats for the red deer population and develop guidelines for managing the development of the red deer population and its influence on the environment.

Methods and Results-MC was attributed to the target lesions by consensus of 2 observers. The predictive value regarding procedural success (PS) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) of MC was analyzed by conventional logistic regression analyses and by inductive machine learning models. The study was adequately powered for the methods applied with 325 target lesions of 250 cases. Overall, PS decreased and MACE increased from type A to type C lesions. Regression analysis identified no single factor as predictive. Logistic regression showed an error rate of 42%. Machine learning techniques achieved an individual predictive error of only 10%, which could be further reduced to 2% by addition of parameters. For PS, MC parameters showed a high ranking for building the model. For MACE, variables of the medical history showed more impact. Conclusions-MC per se cannot individually predict PS or MACE. However, when all MC parameters are integrated together with additional lesion-specific and history variables, a high individual predictive value can be achieved. This technique may be clinically helpful for risk stratification in the catheterization laboratory and improvement of classification systems in interventional cardiology.

J	Wilkins, DE; desJardins, M				Wilkins, DE; desJardins, M			A call for knowledge-based planning	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article							COMPETITION; SIPE-2	We are interested in solving real-world planning problems and, to that end, argue for the use of domain knowledge in planning. We believe that the field must develop methods capable of using rich knowledge models to make planning tools useful for complex problems. We discuss the suitability of current planning paradigms for solving these problems. In particular, we compare knowledge-rich approaches such as hierarchical task network planning to minimal-knowledge methods such as STRIPS-based planners and disjunctive planners. We argue that the former methods have advantages such as scalability, expressiveness, continuous plan modification during execution, and the ability to interact with humans. However, these planners also have limitations, such as requiring complete domain models and failing to model uncertainty, that often make them inadequate for real-world problems. In this article, we define the terms knowledge-based and primitive-action planning and argue for the use of knowledge-based planning as a paradigm for solving real-world problems. We next summarize some of the characteristics of real-world problems that we are interested in addressing. Several current real-world planning applications are described, focusing on the ways in which knowledge is brought to bear on the planning problem. We describe some existing knowledge-based approaches and then discuss additional capabilities, beyond those available in existing systems, that are needed. Finally, we draw an analogy from the current focus of the planning community on disjunctive planners to the experiences of the machine learning community over the past decade.			wilkins@ai.sri.com; marie@ai.sri.com					Agosta JM, 1996, IEEE EXPERT, V11, P6; Anderson C.

It consists of three components-elicitation of linguistic information from humans, a machine learning bootstrapping scheme, and a testing environment. The three components are applied iteratively until a threshold of output quality is attained. The initial application of this technique is for the morphology of low-density languages in the context of the Expedition project at NMSU Computing Research Laboratory. This elicit-build-test technique compiles lexical and inflectional information elicited from a human into a finite-state transducer lexicon and combines this with a sequence of morphographemic rewrite rules that is induced using transformation-based learning from the elicited examples. The resulting morphological analyzer is then tested against a test set, and any corrections are fed back into the learning procedure, which then builds an improved analyzer.

J	Cao, YJ				Cao, YJ			Learner classifier systems: Theory and applications - A state-of-the-art review	ENGINEERING INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Review						classifier systems; genetic algorithms; reinforcement learning; intelligent systems; machine learning	OPTIMIZATION; REINFORCEMENT; DISPATCH; DESIGN; ROBOT	Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) are rule based machine learning systems that use genetic algorithms as their primary rule discovery mechanism. Within these systems, a 'population' of condition/action rules is evolved to find those that cope best with the system's external environment. This idea a learning system based on internal variation and selection - contrasts with more widely studied learning systems based on artificial neural networks, and has found many potential applications in process control, robots control, telecommunication and etc. As such, there has been extensive research in this field. This review attempts to collect, organize, and present in;a unified way some of the most representative publications on learning classifier systems. To organize the literature, the paper presents a categorization of the main components of LCSs, which include rule set and message system, performance system, reinforcement algorithm and rule discovery system and presents some recent advancements. Also, the paper describes some of the most significant applications of LCSs.

J	Foggia, P; Genna, R; Vento, M				Foggia, P; Genna, R; Vento, M			Symbolic vs. connectionist learning: An experimental comparison in a structured domain	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						symbolic learning; connectionist systems; structural description; attributed relational graph; prototype learning; machine learning	SUBGRAPH ISOMORPHISM; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; REPRESENTATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; COMBINATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS	During the last two decades, the attempts of finding effective and efficient solutions to the problem of learning any kind of structured information have been splitting the scientific community. A "holy war" has been fought between the advocates of a symbolic approach to learning and the advocates of a connectionist approach. One of the most repeated claims of the symbolic party has been that symbolic methods are able to cope with structured information while connectionist ones are not. However, in the last few years, the possibility of employing connectionist methods for structured data has been widely investigated and several approaches have been proposed. Does this mean that the connectionist partisans are about to win the ultimate battle? Is connectionism the "One True Approach" to knowledge learning? The paper discusses this topic and gives an experimental answer to these questions. In details, first, a novel algorithm for learning structured descriptions, ascribable to the category of symbolic techniques, is proposed. It faces the problem directly in the space of graphs by defining the proper inference operators, as graph generalization and graph specialization, and obtains general and consistent prototypes with a low computational cost with respect to other symbolic learning systems. Successively, the proposed algorithm is compared with a recent connectionist method for reaming structured data [17] with reference ro a problem of handwritten character recognition from a standard database publicly available on the Web. Finally, after a discussion highlighting pros and cons of symbolic and connectionist approaches, some conclusions, quantitatively supported by the experimental data, are drawn. The orthogonality of the two approaches strongly suggests their combination in a multiclassifier system so as to retain the strengths of both of them, while overcoming their weaknesses. The results on the experimental case-study demonstrated that the adoption of a parallel combination scheme of the two algorithms could improve the recognition performance of about 10 percent. A truce or an alliance between the symbolic and the connectionist worlds?.

Neural networks are used for initial rule extraction, local, or global minimization procedures for optimization, and Gaussian uncertainties of measurements are assumed during application of logical rules, Algorithms for extraction of logical rules from data with real-valued features require determination of linguistic variables or membership functions, Context-dependent membership functions for crisp and fuzzy linguistic variables are introduced and methods of their determination described, Several neural and machine learning methods of logical rule extraction generating initial rules are described, based on constrained multilayer perceptron, networks with localized transfer functions or on separability criteria for determination of linguistic variables. A tradeoff between accuracy/simplicity is explored at the rule extraction stage and between rejection/error level at the optimization stage: Gaussian uncertainties of measurements are assumed during application of crisp logical rules, leading to "soft trapezoidal" membership functions and allowing to optimize the linguistic variables using gradient procedures. Numerous applications of this methodology to benchmark and real-life problems are reported and very simple crisp logical rules for many datasets provided.

Today, the only way to do this is to build specialized applications, which are time-consuming to develop and difficult to maintain. We have addressed this problem by creating the technology and tools for rapidly constructing information agents that extract, query, and integrate data from web sources. Our approach is based on a uniform representation that makes it simple and efficient to integrate multiple sources. Instead of building specialized algorithms for handling web sources, we have developed methods for mapping web sources into this uniform representation. This approach builds on work from knowledge representation, databases, machine learning and automated planning. The resulting system, called Ariadne, makes it fast and easy to build new information agents that access existing web sources. Ariadne also makes it easy to maintain these agents and incorporate new sources as they become available.

J	Kim, JW; Lee, BH; Shaw, MJ; Chang, HL; Nelson, M				Kim, JW; Lee, BH; Shaw, MJ; Chang, HL; Nelson, M			Application of decision-tree induction techniques to personalized advertisements on Internet storefronts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE			English	Article						decision-tree induction; Internet advertising; Internet storefront; machine learning; personalization		Customization and personalization services are a critical success factor for Internet stores and Web service providers. This paper studies personalized recommendation techniques that suggest products or services to the customers of Internet storefronts based on their demographics or past purchasing behavior. The underlining theories of recommendation techniques are statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and rule-based matching. In the rule-based approach to personalized recommendation, marketing rules For personalization are usually obtained from marketing experts and used to perform inferencing based on customer data. However, it is difficult to extract marketing rules from marketing experts, and to validate and maintain the constructed knowledge base. This paper proposes a marketing rule-extraction technique For personalized recommendation on Internet storefronts using machine learning techniques, and especially decision-tree induction techniques. Using tree induction techniques, data-mining tools can generate marketing rules that match customer demographics to product categories. The extracted rules provide personalized advertisement selection when a customer visits an Internet store. An experiment is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with preference scoring and random selection.

This software was developed through several iterations of a three-step approach involving 1) problem analysis and formulation in consultation with two dairy nutrition specialists; 2) development of a case-acquisition and decision-support prototype by the system developer; and 3) use of the prototype by the domain specialists to analyze and classify milk-recording data from example herds. The overall problem was decomposed into three subproblems: removal of outlier tests and lactation curves of individual cows; interpretation of group-average lactation curves; and diagnosis of detected abnormalities at the herd level through the identification of potential management deficiencies. For each subproblem, a software module was developed allowing the user to analyze both graphical and numerical performance representations and classify these representations using predefined linguistic descriptors. The example-based method for the development of the program proved to be very useful, facilitating the communication between system developer and domain specialists, and allowing the specialists to explore the appropriateness of the various prototypes developed. The resulting software represents a formalization of the approach to group-average lactation curve analysis, elicited from the two domain specialists. In future research, the case acquisition and decision-support system will be complemented with knowledge to automate identified classification tasks, which will be captured through the application of machine-learning techniques to example cases, acquired from domain specialists using the software.
