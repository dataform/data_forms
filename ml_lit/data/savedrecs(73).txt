J	Parmee, IC				Parmee, IC			Human-centric intelligent systems for exploration and knowledge discovery	ANALYST			English	Article							DESIGN	This speculative article discusses research and development relating to computational intelligence (CI) technologies comprising powerful machine-based search and exploration techniques that can generate, extract, process and present high-quality information from complex, poorly understood biotechnology domains. The integration and capture of user experiential knowledge within such CI systems in order to support and stimulate knowledge discovery and increase scientific and technological understanding is of particular interest. The manner in which appropriate user interaction can overcome problems relating to poor problem representation within systems utilising evolutionary computation (EC), machine-learning and software agent technologies is investigated. The objective is the development of user-centric intelligent systems that support an improving knowledge-base founded upon gradual problem re-definition and reformulation. Such an approach can overcome initial lack of understanding and associated uncertainty.

It is important for consumers, retailers and food regulatory bodies that these products are of a consistently high quality, authentic, and have not been subjected to adulteration by any lower-grade material either by accident or for economic gain. A variety of methods have been developed for the identification and authentication of muscle foods. However, none of these are rapid or non-invasive, all are time-consuming and difficulties have been encountered in discriminating between the commercially important avian species. Whilst previous attempts have been made to discriminate between muscle foods using infrared spectroscopy, these have had limited success, in particular regarding the closely related poultry species, chicken and turkey. Moreover, this study includes novel data since no attempts have been made to discriminate between both the species and the distinct muscle groups within these species, and this is the first application of Raman spectroscopy to the study of muscle foods. Samples of pre-packed meat and poultry were acquired and FT-IR and Raman measurements taken directly from the meat surface. Qualitative interpretation of FT-IR and Raman spectra at the species and muscle group levels were possible using discriminant function analysis. Genetic algorithms were used to elucidate meaningful interpretation of FT-IR results in (bio)chemical terms and we show that specific wavenumbers, and therefore chemical species, were discriminatory for each type (species and muscle) of poultry sample. We believe that this approach would aid food regulatory bodies in the rapid identification of meat and poultry products and shows particular potential for rapid assessment of food adulteration.

However, heuristic methods, such as those based on evolutionary computing, can be used to explore such search spaces efficiently. We here describe the implementation of an entirely automated (closed-loop) strategy for doing this and apply it to the optimization of gas chromatographic separations of the metabolomes of human serum and of yeast fermentation broths. Without human intervention, the Robot Chromatographer system (i) initializes the settings on the instrument, (ii) controls the analytical run, (iii) extracts the variables defining the analytical performance (specifically the number of peaks, signal/noise ratio, and run time), (iv) chooses (via the PESA-II multiobjective genetic algorithm), and (v) programs the next series of instrumental settings, the whole continuing in an iterative cycle until suitable sets of optimal conditions have been established. Genetic programming was used to remove noise peaks and to establish the basis for the improvements observed. The system showed that the number of peaks observable depended enormously on the conditions used and served to increase them by as much as 3-fold (e.g., to over 950 in human serum) while in many cases maintaining or reducing the run time and preserving excellent signal/noise ratios. The evolutionary closed-loop machine learning strategy we describe is genetic to any type of analytical optimization.

A scheduling agent with a classifier system (CS), which is one GBML method, is employed to generate product-dispatching rules that release materials onto the production floor according to the state of the production floor.

Although efficient techniques have been developed, the calculation of these indexes is, however very difficult in certain type of networks, such as complex capacity-limited networks or in k-terminal problems. In this paper the machine learning algorithm Hamming Clustering (HC), belonging to the family of rule generation methods, is employed to obtain an approximated Availability Expression (AE) for a network, under any success criterion. The AE can be used to evaluate the system availability and then could be transformed, using a set of specific rules, to evaluate system frequency. Two examples related to a complex network are evaluated using the proposed approach. The experiments show that the proposed method, using samples from a Monte Carlo simulation, yield excellent predictions for availability, frequency and duration indexes, with errors less than 1%.

Here we review some of the emerging genomics technologies and data resources that can be used to infer gene function to prioritize candidate genes. We then describe some computational strategies for integrating these large-scale data sets to provide more faithful descriptions of gene function, and how such approaches have recently been applied to discover genes underlying Mendelian disorders.

However, spam filtering is a particularly challenging task as the data distribution and concept being learned changes over time. This is a particularly awkward form of concept drift as the change is driven by spammers wishing to circumvent the spam filters. In this paper we show that lazy learning techniques are appropriate for such dynamically changing contexts. We present a case-based system for spam filtering called ECUE that can learn dynamically. We evaluate its performance as the case-base is updated with new cases. We also explore the benefit of periodically redoing the feature selection process to bring new features into play. Our evaluation shows that these two levels of model update are effective in tracking concept drift.

To refine them into information, the field of chemoinformatics applies techniques from artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and machine learning. A key task concerning organic chemistry is structure elucidation. NMR spectra have become accessible at low expenses of time and sample size, they also are predictable with good precision, and they are directly related to structural properties of the molecule. So the classical approach of ranking structure candidates by comparison of NMR spectra works well, but since the structural space is huge, more sophisticated approaches are in demand. Bayesian networks are promising in this concern, as they allow for contemplation in a dual way: provided an appropriate model, conclusions can be drawn from a given spectrum regarding the corresponding structure or vice versa, since the same interrelations hold in both directions. The development of such a model is documented, and first results are shown supporting the applicability of Bayesian networks to structure elucidation.

The work targets the representation and manipulation of core user, preferences, and context models which facilitate highly-customized and adaptable agents playing key roles in an agent-based Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS). This ATIS finds and fuses information from multiple sources on routes, congestion, incidents, weather, alternative transit modes and schedules, provides proactive real-time updates and context-specific guidance as the user travels, and is vigilant about impacting events. A highly intelligent, personalized, and user-friendly assistant to the traveler, especially in case of transitions among different travel modes, SCATEAgent will promote effective individual traveling and also help to smooth the transportation load in general. The expected contributions include the design of user, preference, context and travel ontologies; user, context, task models based on these ontologies, a set of representations to drive agent behavior and communication, and a compatible integration of rules, machine learning, information retrieval, and semantic web. Currently, we have completed the first stage of our research, producing first pass ontologies and models, an initial prototype of a small-scale test-bed incorporating GPS-enabled cell-phones, and multiple mechanisms for agents to handle and adapt to such models and travel related events.

The industrial design images are treated as two dimensional patterns of intensity variations. In the training phase, the vectorized industrial design images are forwarded to the SVMs, after training the SVMs are used to recognize the new input image. The experiments are performed on industrial design database. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can obtain good result even when the images with relatively low resolution. The effects of different parameters of SVMs on the retrieval performance are investigated also.

Its detection involves analysis of images containing specific objects (bands), whose position and intensity are critical for doping positivity. Within a research project of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) we are implementing the GASepo software that should serve for Epo testing in doping control laboratories world-wide. For identification of the bands we have developed a segmentation procedure based on a sequence of filters and edge detectors. Whereas all true bands are properly segmented, the procedure generates a relatively high number of false positives (artefacts). To separate these artefacts we suggested a post-segmentation supervised classification using real-valued geometrical measures of objects. The method is based on the ID3 (Ross Quinlan's) rule generation method, where fuzzy representation is used for linking the linguistic terms to quantitative data. The fuzzy modification of the ID3 method provides a framework that generates fuzzy decision trees, as well as fuzzy sets for input data. Using the MLF (TM) software (Machine Learning Framework) we have generated a set of fuzzy rules explicitly describing bands and artefacts. The method eliminated most of the artefacts. The contribution includes a comparison of the obtained misclassification errors to the errors produced by some other statistical classification methods.

These features are often separately selected and learned by machine learning methods. In this paper, the relation between distinct features obtained by different feature extraction approaches from the same original images was studied by Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA). We apply a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in the learnt semantic space of the combined features and compare against SVM on the raw data and previously published state-of-the-art results. Experiment show that significant improvement is achieved with the SVM in the semantic space in comparison with direct SVM classification on the raw data.

In principle, model generalization can improve the detection rate but may also degrade the detection performance. Therefore, the relation between model generalization and detection performance is critical for intrusion detection. However, most of past research only evaluates the overall efficiency of an intrusion detection technique via detection rate and false alarm/positive rate, rather than the usefulness of model generalization for intrusion detection. In this paper, we try to do such evaluation, and then to find the implications of model generalization on intrusion detection. Within our proposed methodology, model generalization can be achieved in three levels. In this paper, we evaluate the first level model generalization. The experimental results show that the first level model generalization is useful mostly to enhance the detection performance of intrusion detection. However, its implications for intrusion detection are different with respect to different detection techniques. Our studies show that in general, though it is useful to generalize the normal behavior model so that more normal behaviors can be identified as such, the same is not advisable for the intrusive behavior model. Therefore, the intrusion signatures should be built compactly without first level generalization.

J	Suzuki, E				Suzuki, E			Worst case and a distribution-based case analyses of sampling for rule discovery based on generality and accuracy	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						knowledge discovery in data bases; rule discovery; sampling	FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES; INDUCTION	In this paper, we propose two sampling theories of rule discovery based on generality and accuracy. The first theory concerns the worst case: it extends a preliminary version of PAC learning, which represents a worst-case analysis for classification. In our analysis, a rule is defined as a probabilistic constraint of true assignment to the class attribute for corresponding examples, and we mainly analyze the case in which we try to avoid finding a bad rule. Effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through examples for conjunction-rule discovery. The second theory concerns a distribution-based case: it represents the conditions that a rule exceeds pre-specified thresholds for generality and accuracy with high reliability. The idea is to assume a 2-dimensional normal distribution for two probabilistic variables, and obtain the conditions based on their confidence region. This approach has been validated experimentally using 21 benchmark data sets in the machine learning community against conventional methods each of which evaluates the reliability of generality. Discussions on related work are provided for PAC learning, multiple comparison, and analysis of association-rule discovery.

This work describes Machine Learning (ML) techniques designed to improve the information offered to farmers on animals producing high SCCs according to particular herd profiles. The analysed population included 71 dairy farms in Asturias (Northern Spain) and a total of 2,407 lactating cows. Four sources of information were available: a) a questionnaire survey describing facilities, milking routines and management practices of the farms studied; b) dairy recording information; c) classification of the cows suspected of being healthy or subclinical mastitic according to farmers' expertise; and d) positive or negative scores with respect to the California Mastitis Test (CMT). The decimal logarithm of the SCC (linear score), lactation number, herd size, lactating cows per milker, milk urea concentration, number of clusters per milker and actual SCC are shown to be the most informative attributes for mimicking both farmers' expertise or CMT performance in order to identify animals producing persistently high SCCs in dairy herds. However, to improve the identification of cows suspected of being non-healthy, the system uses other information related to management and milking routines. Decision rules to predict CMT performance can provide useful, additional information to farmers to improve the management of dairy herds included in milk recording programs.

Although most of these materials are already in digital form (either as born-digital information, or converted to digital form through scanning), preservation of these materials involve complex administrative and technical issues, such as obtaining and storing adequate levels of metadata for a preserved resource, assuring intellectual integrity of the contents, and avoiding technical obsolescence of encoded information. (1,2) An R&D project has been initiated at NLM to develop a prototype system that would help investigate the key technical functions required to effectively preserve NLM's digital resources over the long term. This system, named the System for Preservation of Electronic Resources (SPER) has had its initial design and implementation phase completed. Here we describe the main functions of SPER, and the strategies adopted in designing the system to meet these functionalities in a modular and cost-effective manner. In particular, an automated metadata extraction subsystem is designed to minimize manual entry, using string matching and machine learning techniques. Also given are preliminary performance assessments of the subsystems in this prototype. We discuss the overall system architecture, automated metadata extraction techniques, and file migration in the SPER system.

These weights are then used in calculation of Euclidean distances. The performance analyses were conducted in the previous study by using machine learning benchmark datasets. In this study, the performance of AWAIS was investigated for real world problems. The used datasets were medical datasets consisting of Statlog Heart Disease and Pima Indian Diabetes datasets taken from University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. Classification accuracies for these datasets were obtained through using 10-fold cross validation method. AWAIS reached 82.59% classification accuracy for Statlog Heart Disease while it obtained a classification accuracy of 75.87% for Pima Indians Diabetes. These results are comparable with other classifiers and give promising performance to AWAIS for that kind of problems.

In the Naive Bayes classifier, all variables are assumed to be nominal variables, it means that each variable has a finite number of values. But in large databases, the variables often take continuous values or have a large number of numerical values. So many researchers discussed the discretization (or partitioning) for domain of the continuous variables. In this paper we generalize the Naive Bayes classifier to the situation in which the fuzzy partitioning for the variable domains instead of discretization is taken. Therefore each variable in the Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier can take a linguistic value represented by a fuzzy set. One method for estimating the conditional probabilities in the Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier is proposed. This generalization can decrease the complexity for learning optimal discretization, and increase the power for dealing with imprecise data and the large databases. Some well-known classification problems in machine learning field have been tested, the results show that the Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier is an effective tool to deal with classification problem which has continuous variables.

Several e-markets, specifically for construction, have also been established, including bLiquid.com and ProcureZone. However, most websites provide only two primary ways of searching for information, namely by index/menu or by keyword. Instead of relying on the primitive search engines found in most procurement websites, a search guide system could help a user's keyword search by reducing the number of keywords required to find the desired information. Our research recognized that professional procurement experience helped users more effectively carry out website information searches, by using fewer keywords. We planned to capture such experience in order to guide inexperienced users in their search. The research goal was to improve search effectiveness by guiding the user's search using three approaches, namely correction, specification and extension. Based on these three approaches, this research applied the following guides: correction; specification-by-equivalence; specification-by-detail; extension-by-time; extension-by-location; extension-by-team; and extension-by-component. The paper will describe how we classified users for learning credibility, and the learning framework for recording expert users' search patterns. Twelve professionals, using 14 procurement packages, with 64 items in total, evaluated the proposed framework. It will be demonstrated that the proposed learning keyword guide facilitated a dynamic, customized menu and indexing system, and reduced the number of keywords required for the professionals to find the information they desired.

More open ended items have generally been considered unsuitable for machine marking because of the difficulty of coping with the myriad ways in which credit-worthy answers may be expressed. Successful automatic marking of free text answers would seem to presuppose an advanced level of performance in automated natural language understanding. However, recent advances in computational linguistics techniques have opened up the possibility of being able to automate the marking of free text responses typed into a computer without having to create systems that fully understand the answers. This paper describes the use of information extraction and machine learning techniques in the marking of short, free text responses of up to around five lines.

J	Tung, WL; Quek, C				Tung, WL; Quek, C			GenSo-FDSS: a neural-fuzzy decision support system for pediatric ALL cancer subtype identification using gene expression data	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						neural fuzzy system; fuzzy decision support system; GenSoFNN; truth-value restriction; discrete incremental clustering; fuzzy inference and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; VERIFICATION SYSTEM; INFERENCE SYSTEM; NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; LOGIC; MICROARRAYS; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS	Objective: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy of childhood, representing nearly one third of all pediatric cancers. Currently, the treatment of pediatric ALL is centered on tailoring the intensity of the therapy applied to a patient's risk of relapse, which is linked to the type of leukemia the patient has. Hence, accurate and correct diagnosis of the various leukemia subtypes becomes an important first step in the treatment process. Recently, gene expression profiting using DNA microarrays has been shown to be a viable and accurate diagnostic toot to identify the known prognosticatty important ALL subtypes. Thus, there is currently a huge interest in developing autonomous classification systems for cancer diagnosis using gene expression data. This is to achieve an unbiased analysis of the data and also partly to handle the large amount of genetic information extracted from the DNA microarrays. Methodology: Generally, existing medical decision support systems (DSS) for cancer classification and diagnosis are based on traditional statistical methods such as Bayesian decision theory and machine learning models such as neural networks (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Though high accuracies have been reported for these systems, they fall short on certain critical areas. These included (a) being able to present the extracted knowledge and explain the computed solutions to the users; (b) having a logical deduction process that is similar and intuitive to the human reasoning process; and (c) flexible enough to incorporate new knowledge without running the risk of eroding old but valid information. On the other hand, a neural fuzzy system, which is synthesized to emulate the human ability to learn and reason in the presence of imprecise and incomplete information, has the ability to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. However, existing neural fuzzy systems have their own limitations when used in the design and implementation of DSS. Hence, this paper proposed the use of a novel neural fuzzy system: the generic self-organising fuzzy neural network (GenSoFNN) with truth-value restriction (TVR) fuzzy inference, as a fuzzy DSS (denoted as GenSo-FDSS) for the classification of ALL subtypes using gene expression data. Results and conclusion: The performance of the GenSo-FDSS system is encouraging when benchmarked against those of NN, SVM and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier. On average, a classification rate of above 90% has been achieved using the GenSo-FDSS system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The abstraction method presented in this paper provides two levels of symbolic interpretation. The first, at mono parametric level, provides 4 classes (increasing, decreasing, constant and transient) by combination of trends computed at two characteristic spans. The second, at multi parametric level, gives an index of global behavior of the system, that is used to segment the observation. Each segment is therefore described as a sequence of words that combines the results of symbolization. Each step of the abstraction process leads to a visual representation that can be validated by the clinician. Construction of sequences do not need any prior introduction of medical knowledge. Sequences can be introduced in a machine learning process in order to extract temporal patterns related to specific clinical or technical events.

They all are based on computing weighted sum of risk factors. We propose instead to use more flexible expert systems to estimate the risk. The goal of the AtherEx expert system is to classify patients according to their 14 atherosclerosis risk into four groups. This application is based on the NEST rule-based expert system shell. Knowledge for the AtherEx was obtained (using the machine learning algorithm KEX) from the data concerning a longitudial study of atherosclerosis risk factors and further refined by domain expert. AtherEx is available for consultations on web.

It relies on a machine-learning technique that infers transducers from examples of bilingual word pairs; no additional resource or knowledge is needed. Then, these transducers, making the most of the high regularity of translation discovered in the examples, can be used to translate unseen French terms into English or vice versa. We report evaluations that show that this technique achieves high precision, reaching up to 85% of correct translations for both French to English and English to French tasks.

In the rapidly growing field of biomedicine, knowledge is usually evolving and therefore an ontology maintenance process is required to keep the ontological knowledge up-to-date. This paper presents our approach for populating a formally defined ontology for the allergen domain exploiting PubMed abstracts on allergens and using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. This approach is composed of two stages: locating initially instances of ontology concepts in the PubMed corpus, and finding at a 2nd stage instances' properties and relations between instances.

Pathological conditions, technically poor quality images and artifacts necessitate that algorithms use sufficient background knowledge of anatomy and spatial relations of bones in order to work satisfactorily. We present a robust knowledge based methodology for detecting reference points of the main skeletal regions that simultaneously processes anterior and posterior whole-body bone scintigrams. Expert knowledge is represented as a set of parameterized rules which are used to support standard image processing algorithms. Our study includes 467 consecutive, non-selected scintigrams, which is to our knowledge the largest number of images ever used in such studies. Automatic analysis of whole-body bone scans using our knowledge based segmentation algorithm gives more accurate and reliable results than previous studies. Obtained reference points are used for automatic segmentation of the skeleton, which is used for automatic (machine learning) or manual (expert physicians) diagnostics. Preliminary experiments show that an expert system based on machine learning closely mimics the results of expert physicians.

Controlling feature selection bias is considered a major issue for a realistic assessment of the feature selection process. We propose a theoretical, probabilistic framework for the analysis of selection bias. In particular, we derive the means of calculating the true selection error when the performance estimates of the feature subsets are mutually dependent and the distribution density of the true error is arbitrary. We demonstrate in an extensive series of experiments the utility of the theoretical derivations with real-world datasets. We discuss the importance of understanding feature selection bias for the small sample size (n)/high dimensionality (p) situation, typical for biomedical data (genomics, proteomics, spectroscopy).

Instead of predicting a single label, the constraint is relaxed to allow prediction of a subset of labels given a desired confidence level 1 - delta. Ideally, effective region predictions should be (1) well calibrated - predictive regions at confidence level 1 - delta should err with relative frequency at most delta and (2) be as narrow (or certain) as possible. We present a simple technique to generate confidence region predictions from conditional probability estimates (probability forecasts). We use this 'conversion' technique to generate confidence region predictions from probability forecasts output by standard machine learning algorithms when tested on 15 multi-class datasets. Our results show that approximately 44% of experiments demonstrate well-calibrated confidence region predictions, with the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm tending to perform consistently well across all data. Our results illustrate the practical benefits of effective confidence region prediction with respect to medical diagnostics, where guarantees of capturing the true disease label can be given.

The case of neural nets applied to speech recognition is no exception, but this situation is unusual in the sense that the neural nets here act as posterior probability estimators and not as classifiers. Most remedies designed to handle the class imbalance problem in classification invalidate the proof that justifies the use of neural nets as posterior probability models. In this paper we examine one of these, the training scheme called probabilistic sampling, and show that it is fortunately still applicable. First, we argue that theoretically it makes the net estimate scaled class-conditionals instead of class posteriors, but for the hidden Markov model speech recognition framework it causes no problems, and in fact fits it even better. Second, we will carry out experiments to show the feasibility of this training scheme. In the experiments we create and examine a transition between the conventional and the class-based sampling, knowing that in practice the conditions of the mathematical proofs are unrealistic. The results show that the optimal performance can indeed be attained somewhere in between, and is slightly better than the scores obtained in the traditional way.

Several transformational techniques have been used for this purpose: Principal Component Analysis, the Adaptive Autoregressive Model, FFT or Wavelet Transforms, etc. However, it would be useful to automatically build significant attributes appropriate for each particular problem. In this paper, we use Genetic Programming to evolve projections that translate EEG data into a new vectorial space (coordinates of this space being the new attributes), where projected data can be more easily classified. Although our method is applied here in a straightforward way to check for feasibility, it has achieved reasonable classification results that are comparable to those obtained by other state of the art algorithms. In the future, we expect that by choosing carefully primitive functions, Genetic Programming will be able to give original results that cannot be matched by other machine learning classification algorithms.

We have carried out a pilot project using DPOSS data to study strong variables and transients; and are now extending it to the new Palomar-QUEST synoptic sky survey. We report on our early findings and outline the methodology to be implemented in preparation for a real-time transient detection pipeline. In addition to large numbers of known types of highly variable sources (e.g., SNe, CVs, OVV QSOs, etc.), we expect to find numerous transients whose nature may be established by a rapid follow-up. Whereas we will make all detected variables publicly available through the web, we anticipate that email alerts would be issued in the real time for a subset of events deemed to be the most interesting. This real-time process entails many challenges, in an effort to maintain a high completeness while keeping the contamination low. We will utilize distributed Grid services developed by the GRIST project, and implement a variety of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

In this study, we propose to take advantage of both sources of information in a discriminative framework. Initially, each source of information is processed on a per expert basis (plus on a per client basis for the first information and on a per example basis for the second information). Then, both sources of information are combined using a second-level classifier, across different experts. Although the formulation of such two-step solution is not new, the novelty lies in the way the sources of prior knowledge are incorporated prior to fusion using the second-level classifier. Because these two sources of information are of very different nature, one often needs to devise special algorithms to combine both information sources. Our framework that we call "Prior Knowledge Incorporation" has the advantage of using the standard machine learning algorithms. Based on 10 x 32 = 320 intramodal and multimodal fusion experiments carried out on the publicly available XM2VTS score-level fusion benchmark database, it is found that the generalisation performance of combining both information sources improves over using either or none of them, thus achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on this database.

However. in order to find the desired information. it may be necessary to enter keywords using a trial-and-error process. This research recognizes that professional procurement experience can help users search website information more effectively, by using fewer keywords. and so proposes a learning model and suggestion model that can capture such experience. thus guiding inexperienced users in their search. Experiments, evaluating the performance of the system, were also conducted. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To make our system fit for the application and to embed this model gateway for real-time text filtering, we need to further select more accurate features. In this paper, we proposed a new feature selection method based on Rough set theory. It generate several reducts, but the special point is that between these reducts there are no common attributes, so these attributes have more powerfully capability to classify new objects, especially for real data set in application. We choose two data sets to evaluate our feature selection method, one is a benchmark data set from UCI machine learning archive, and another is captured from Web. We use statistical classification methods to classify these objects, in the benchmark testing set, we get good precision with a single reduct, but in real date set, we get good precision with several reducts, and the data set is used in our system for topic-specific text filtering. Thus we conclude our method is very effective in application. In addition, we also conclude that SVM and VSM methods get better performance, while Naive Bayes method get poor performance with the same selected features on non-balance data set.

A recent practice is to combine Data Mining and Multi-Agent Systems approaches. In this paper we propose the use of cooperative negotiation to construct an integrated and coherent domain model from several sources. Agents encapsule different symbolic machine learning algorithms to induce their individual models. After this, a global model yields from the interaction via cooperative negotiation of these agents. The results shows that the proposed approach improves the accuracy of the individual models, integrating the best representations of each one.

The clustering problem is formalized as a semi-defined optimization program, based on the correlation provided by two quantities, respectively related to an agreement and a disagreement between a pair of genes. We also intend to validate the role of the correlation clustering algorithm by comparing the results with a support vectors clustering approach [Ben-Hur et al., 2001] that is demonstrated to perform well for many applications.

One can use these comprehensive snapshots of biological activity to infer regulatory pathways in cells, identify novel targets for drug design, and improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning for those suffering from disease. However, the amount of data this new technology produces is more than one can manually analyze. Hence, the need for automated analysis of microarray data offers an opportunity for machine learning to have a significant impact on biology and medicine. Probabilistic Principal Surfaces defines a unified theoretical framework for nonlinear latent variable models embracing the Generative Topographic Mapping as a special case. This article describes the use of PPS for the analysis of yeast gene expression levels from microarray chips showing its effectiveness for high-D data visualization and clustering.

To optimize bioreactor operation with respect to clinical application an early prediction of the long-term bioreactor culture performance is of interest. Data from 70 liver cell bioreactor runs labeled by low (n=18), medium (n=34) and high (n=18) performance were analyzed by statistical and machine learning methods. 25 variables characterizing donor organ properties, organ preservation, cell isolation and cell inoculation prior to bioreactor operation were analyzed with respect to their importance to bioreactor performance prediction.

In this paper we propose a system for automatic and precise diagnosis of a tumor's origin based on genetic data. This system is based on a combination of coding theory techniques and machine learning algorithms. In particular, tumor classification is described as a multiclass learning setup, where gene expression values serve the system to distinguish between types of tumors. Since multiclass learning is intrinsically complex, the data is divided into several biclass problems whose results are combined with an error correcting linear block code. The robustness of the prediction is increased as errors of the base binary classifiers are corrected by the linear code. Promising results have been achieved with a best case precision of 72% when the system was tested on real data from cancer patients.

Recently Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been demonstrated as an effective tool in analyzing microarray data. Previous work involving SVM used every gene in the microarray to classify normal and malignant lymphoid tissue. This paper shows that, using gene selection techniques that selected only 10% of the genes in "Lymphochip" (a DNA microarray developed at Stanford University School of Medicine), a classification accuracy of about 98% is achieved which is a comparable performance to using every gene. This paper thus demonstrates the usefulness of feature selection techniques in conjunction with SVM to improve its performance in analyzing Lymphochip microarray data. The improved performance was evident in terms of better accuracy, ROC (receiver operating characteristics) analysis and faster training. Using the subsets of Lymphochip, this paper then compared the performance of SVM against two other well-known classifiers: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Experimental results show that SVM outperforms the other two classifiers.

So, how to improve quality of the template, which is called template improvement, is important to automatic fingerprint identify system. In this paper, we propose a template improve algorithm. Based on the case-based method of machine learning and probability theory, we improve the template by deleting pseudo minutia, restoring lost genuine minutia and updating the information of minutia such as positions and directions. And special fingerprint image database is built for this work. Experimental results on this database indicate that our method is effective and quality of fingerprint template is improved evidently. Accordingly, performance of fingerprint matching is also improved stably along with the increase of using time.

The presented approach combines a number of component classifiers which are standard machine learning classification algorithms, using a second layer paradigm to obtain a better classification accuracy. Experimental results have been obtained using a datafile of cases that-contains information about surfaces, extracted from images obtained by the robot. The classification problem consists of recognizing to which of the surfaces belongs a n x n size subimage.

The, exponentially increasing volume and complexity of modern, data sets promises to transform the scientific practice, but also, poses a number of common technological challenges. The Virtual Observatory concept is the astronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the progress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same time provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer science. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or "data farming"), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases, interoperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and knowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and classification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition, visualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as various applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are forming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data sets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern society, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful emerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the science-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science, scholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century.

From a pool of features computed from the thin-slice scans, a genetic algorithm is used to determine an optimal feature subset for training a classifier that will eliminate as many of the false positives as possible while retaining the true nodules. We use support vector machines as the classifier for its superior performance. The experiment was conducted on a database of 66 true nodules and 123 false ones. From 15 features calculated for each nodule our approach selected 9 as the optimal feature subset size and the resulting classifier trained with a selected set of 9 features was able to achieve 98.5% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity using leave-one-out cross validation.

Gene expression profiles are composed of thousands of genes at the same time, representing complex relationships between them. One of the well-known constraints specifically related to microarray data is the large number of genes in comparison with the small number of available experiments or cases. In this context, the ability to identify an accurate gene selection strategy is crucial to reduce the generalization error (false positives) of state-of-the-art classification algorithms. This paper presents a reduction algorithm based on the notion of fuzzy gene expression, where similar (co-expressed) genes belonging to different patients are selected in order to construct a supervised prototype-based retrieval model. This technique is employed to implement the retrieval step in our new gene-CBR system. The proposed method is illustrated with the analysis of microarray data belonging to bone marrow cases from 43 adult patients with cancer plus a group of three cases corresponding to healthy persons.

One way in which this can be achieved is by providing users with interpretable explanations of the system's predictions. CBR systems have long been understood to have an inherent transparency that has particular advantages for explanations compared with other machine learning techniques. However simply supplying the most similar case is often not enough. In this paper we present a framework for providing interpretable explanations of CBR systems which includes dynamically created discursive texts explaining the feature-value relationships and a measure of confidence of the CBR system's prediction being correct. We also present a means by which the trade-off between being overly confident or overly cautious can be evaluated and different methods compared. We have carried out a preliminary user evaluation of the framework and present our findings. It is clear from this evaluation that being right is important. It appears that caveats and notes of caution when the system is uncertain damage user confidence.

One approach to simplify the definition of similarity measures involves the use of machine learning techniques. In this paper we investigate important aspects of these approaches in order to support a more goal-directed choice and application of existing approaches and to initiate the development of new techniques. This investigation is based on a novel formal generalization of the classic CBR cycle, which allows a more suitable analysis of the requirements, goals, assumptions and restrictions that are relevant for learning similarity measures.

We introduce a hierarchy of knowledge types and show how the types can be incorporated into similarity measures. Furthermore, we analyze how properties of the domain theory, such as partialness and vagueness, influence classification accuracy. Experiments in a simple domain suggest that partial knowledge is more useful than vague knowledge. However, for data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we show that even vague domain knowledge that in isolation performs at chance level can substantially increase classification accuracy when being incorporated into similarity-based classification.

Manual code generation is very time consuming, but it is often the only choice since the code generated by today's compiler technology often has much lower performance than the best hand-tuned codes. A promising code generation strategy, implemented by systems like ATLAS, FFTW and SPIRAL, uses empirical search to find the parameter values of the implementation, such as the tile size and instruction schedules, that deliver near-optimal performance for a particular machine. However this approach has only proven successful on scientific codes whose performance does not depend on the input data. In this paper we study machine learning techniques to extend empirical search to the generation of sorting routines, whose performance depends on the input characteristics and the architecture of the target machine. We build on a previous study that selects a "pure" sorting algorithm at the outset of the computation as a function of the standard deviation. The approach discussed in this paper uses genetic algorithms and a classifier system to build hierarchically-organized hybrid sorting algorithms capable of adapting to the input data. Our results show that such algorithms generated using the approach presented in this paper are quite effective at taking into account the complex interactions between architectural and input data characteristics and that the resulting code performs significantly better than conventional sorting implementations and the code generated by our earlier study. In particular the routines generated using our approach perform better than all the commercial libraries that we tried including IBM ESSL, INTEL MKL and the C++STL. The best algorithm we have been able to generate is on the average 26% and 62% faster than the IBM ESSL in an IBM Power 3 and IBM Power 4, respectively.

While recent research has shown that modeling is effective for some compiler problems, building accurate models requires a great deal of human time and effort. This paper describes how machine learning techniques can be leveraged to help compiler writers model complex systems. Because learning techniques can effectively make sense of high dimensional spaces, they can be a valuable tool for clariffing and discerning complex decision boundaries. In this work we focus on loop unrolling, a well-known optimization for exposing instruction level parallelism. Using the Open Research Compiler as a testbed, we demonstrate how one can use supervised learning techniques to determine the appropriateness of loop unrolling. We use more than 2,500 loops - drawn from 72 benchmarks to train two different learning algorithms to predict unroll factors (i.e., the amount by which to unroll a loop) for any novel loop. The technique correctly predicts the unroll factor for 65% of the loops in our dataset, which leads to a 5% overall improvement for the SPEC 2000 benchmark suite (9% for the SPEC 2000floating point benchmarks).

The essence of the approach is a combination of gene expression, microarray-based sensing, information fusion, machine learning and pattern recognition. Integration of these elements is a distinguishing aspect of the approach, leading to a number of significant advantages. Amongst them are the applicability to various agent types including bacteria, viruses, toxins, and others, ability to operate without the knowledge of a pathogen's genome sequence and without the need for bioagent-specific materials or reagents, and a high level of extensibility. Furthermore, the approach allows detection of uncataloged agents, including emerging pathogens. The approach offers a promising avenue for automatic identification of biological agents for applications such as medical diagnostics, bioforensics, and biodefense.

The representation used in TIME extends the Allen temporal interval relations and allows for proper inclusion of context and synchronization of the heterogeneous information sources involved in multimedia pattern recognition. For automatic classification of highlights in soccer video, we compare three different machine learning techniques, i.c. C4.5 decision tree, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machine. It was found that by using the TIME framework the amount of video a user has to watch in order to see almost all highlights can be reduced considerably, especially in combination with a Support Vector Machine.

We focus on a recent and due to its sparsity properties very promising smoothing approach coming from the area of machine learning, the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), developed by Tipping (2000). Two correction methods for measurement error are then applied to the RVM: regression calibration (Carroll et al. (1995)) and the SIMEX method (Carroll et al. (1995)). We show why standard regression calibration fails and present a simulation study that indicates an improvement of the RVM regression in terms of bias when SIMEX correction is applied.

An interesting pair for such a combination is kernel logistic regression to estimate conditional probabilities and E-support vector regression to estimate conditional expectations. A strategy based on this combination can be helpful to detect and to model high-dimensional dependency structures in complex data sets, e.g. for constructing insurance tariffs.

One of them is the appropriate and effective coordination and monitoring of distributed businesses processes. It is not easy or trivial to handle the enormous amount of information about and from VOs members. As a direct consequence, decisions are crucial and should be taken not only with agility, but also with intelligence. This paper introduces a framework to support an integrated decision-making environment through which managers will be able to take assisted and smarter decisions. The key element of this framework is the Intelligent Decision Support System, which applies Artificial Intelligence techniques (Data Mining and Machine Learning) to facilitate and to support the decision-making process.

We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time in the size of an output graph if graphs are trees of bounded degree and the lengths of given paths are bounded by a constant. On the other hand, we show that this problem is strongly NP-hard even for planar graphs of bounded degree.

Most popular ensemble methods do specify neither the number of component models nor their complexity. However, these parameters strongly influence the generalization capability of the meta-model. In this paper we propose an ensemble method which generates a meta-model with optimal values for these parameters. The proposed method suggests using resampling techniques to generate multiple estimations of the generalization error and multiple comparison procedures to select the models that will be combined to form the meta-model. Experimental results show the performance of the model on regression and classification tasks using artificial and real databases.

From this, we need a system to recommend a visitor good information, This recommendation system can be constructed by web usage mining process. The web usage mining mines web log records to discover user access patterns of web pages. Also it is the application of data mining techniques to large web log data in order to extract usage patterns from user's click streams. In general, the size of web log records is so large that we have difficulty to analyze web log data. To make matter worse, the web log records are very sparse. So it is very hard to estimate the dependency between the web pages. In this paper, we solved this difficulty of web usage mining using support vector machine. In the experiments, we verified our proposed method by given data from UCI machine learning repository and KDD cup 2000.

Their objective is to improve the accuracy. In previous works, we have presented a method for the generation of ensembles, named rotation-based. It transforms the training data set; it groups, randomly, the attributes in different subgroups, and applies, for each group, an axis rotation. If the used method for the induction of the classifiers is not invariant to rotations in the data set, the generated classifiers can be very different. In this way, different classifiers can be obtained (and combined) using the same induction method. The bias-variance decomposition of the error is used to get some insight into the behaviour of a classifier. It has been used to explain the success of ensemble learning techniques. In this work the bias and variance for the presented and other ensemble methods are calculated and used for comparison purposes.

In this research we present a new approach to find a SI using a list code based representation without candidate generation. We implement a step by step expansion model with a width-depth search. The proposed approach is suitable to work with labeled and unlabeled graphs, with directed and undirected edges. Our experiments show a promising method to be used with scalable graph matching.

As opposed to the traditional static clustering algorithms, our method implements variable length chromosome which allows the algorithm to search for both optimal cluster center positions and cluster number. Thus the cluster number is optimized during run time dynam ically instead of being pre-specified as a parameter. We also introduce two complementary objective functions--compactness and connectedness instead of one single objective. To optimize the two measures simultaneously, the NSGA-II, a highly efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, is adapted for the clustering problem. The simultaneous optimization of these objectives improves the quality of the resulting clustering of problems with different data properties. At last, we apply our algorithm on several real data sets from the UCI machine learning repository and obtain good results.

But its conditional independence assumption is rarely true in real-world applications. We show that the independence assumption can be approximated by orthogonally rotational transformation of input space. During the transformation process, the continuous attributes are treated in different ways rather than simply applying discretization or assuming them to satisfy some standard probability distribution. Furthermore, the information from unlabeled instances can be naturally utilized to improve parameter estimation without considering the negative effect caused by missing class labels. The empirical results provide evidences to support our explanation.

Its basic idea can be represented as: A 'weak' learning algorithm that performs just slightly better than random guessing can be 'boosted' into an arbitrarily accurate 'strong' learning algorithm, Inspired from the fascinating idea, the paper used ensemble method to improve the performance of genetic algorithm and proposed an efficient hybrid optimization algorithm: GA ensemble. In GA ensemble, a collection of genetic algorithms are designed to solve the same problem and population of each algorithm is sampled from a solutions pool using bagging method. Experiments on combinatorial optimization problem and GA-deceptive problems show that ensemble method improves the performance of genetic algorithm greatly.

It, is possible to extend those predictive models to a, few steps ahead and iterate the predictions thus allowing further forecasting. However, it is not possible to do this for thousands of data points because cumulative error tends to make the long term forecasting unreliable. Such uncertainty can be conveyed by the rise of fuzzy forecasting where the forecasted value is a fuzzy set rather than a number. The end-user can only appreciate the uncertainty of the forecast if the forecasting model is easy to understand. Contrary to common "black-box" models, we rise symbolic machine learning on Symbolic representations of time-series. In this paper, we tackle the real-world issue of forecasting electric load for one year, sampled every ten minutes, with data, available for the past few years. In this context, future values are not only related to their short term previous values. but also to temporal attributes (the day of the week, holidays...). We use a symbolic machine learning algorithm (decision tree) to extract this kind of knowledge and predict future pattern occurences. Those patterns are learnt when building a symbolic representation of the time series; by clustering episodes showing similar patterns and making the cluster a symbolic attribute of I, lie episodes. Intra-class variations result in forecasting uncertainty that we model through Fuzzy prototypes. Those prototypes are then used to construct a fuzzy forecasting easily understood by the end-user.

Based on a sensitive quality measure we analyze correlations between the number of parameters, the learning cost and the performance of the trained SVM in classifying independent test data. In addition we study the influence of the quality measure on the classification performance and compare the behavior of serial and asynchronous parallel parameter tuning on an IBM p690 cluster.

Numerous tools are available to help students check their spelling and grammar. Very little, however, has been done to help them with higher level problems in their texts. In order to do this, we need to be able to analyse the discourse relations within their texts. This is particularly problematic for texts of this kind, since they contain few instances of explicit discourse markers such as 'however', 'moreover', 'therefore'. The situation is made worse by the fact that many texts produced by such students contain large numbers of spelling and grammatical errors, thus making linguistic analysis extremely challenging. The current paper reports on a number of experiments in classification of the discourse relations in such essays. The work explores the use of machine learning techniques to identify such relations in unseen essays, using a corpus of manually annotated essays as a training set.

Traditional supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. [1, 2,3]) do resolution based on the mention-level. Specifically, a pairwise classifier is learned and used to determine whether or not two NPs in a document refer to the same entity in the world. However, as an individual mention usually lacks adequate information about its referred entity (e.g, we could not know the gender or the name of "the president"), it is often difficult to determine whether or not two NPs refer to the same entity simply from the pair itself. Recent research ([4, 5]) has revealed that entity information could help resolution. In our work we would like to further study how to effectively incorporate the entity information into coreference resolution. The framework of such a entity-based system is presented and different resolution strategies are investigated in this paper.

Although automated IE systems began to be developed using machine learning techniques recently, the performances of those IE systems still need to be improved. This paper describes an information extraction system based on transformation-based learning, which uses learned meta-rules on patterns for slots. We plan to empirically show these techniques improve the performance of the underlying information extraction System by running experiments on a corpus of IT resume documents collected from Internet newsgroups.

A great disadvantage of current approaches is their intrinsic dependence to the application domain and the target language. Several machine learning techniques have been applied in order to facilitate the portability of the information extraction systems. This paper describes a general method for building an information extraction system using regular expressions along with supervised learning algorithms. In this method, the extraction decisions are lead by a set of classifiers instead of sophisticated linguistic analyses. The paper also shows a system called TOPO that allows to extract the information related with natural disasters from newspaper articles in Spanish language. Experimental results of this system indicate that the proposed method can be a practical solution for building information extraction systems reaching an F-measure as high as 72%.

These keyphrases should provide general information about the contents and the topics of the article. Keyphrases may save precious time for tasks such as filtering, summarization, and categorization. In this paper, we investigate automatic extraction and learning of keyphrases from scientific articles written in English. Firstly, we introduce various baseline extraction methods. Some of them, formalized by us, are very successful for academic papers. Then, we integrate these methods using different machine learning methods. The best results have been achieved by J48, an improved variant of C4.5. These results are significantly better than those achieved by previous extraction systems, regarded as the state of the art.

Usually, this data is for software system's internal use to provide proactive services. Hence, it makes sense not to store this entire huge amount of data but to identify and remove some irrelevant data (garbage collecting context), summarize the left over and only store this summarized and more meaningful data. We believe that such a summarization will result in improved performance in query processing, data retrieval, knowledge reasoning and machine learning. Besides, it will also save the storage space required to store context repository. In this paper, we will present the idea and motivation behind context summarization and garbage collecting context and some possible techniques to achieve this.

Due to incomplete biomedical information databases, the extraction is not straightforward using dictionaries, and several approaches using contextual rules and machine learning have previously been proposed. Our work is inspired by the previous approaches, but is novel in the sense that it is using Google for semantic annotation of the biomedical words. The semantic annotation accuracy obtained - 52% on words not found in the Brown Corpus, Swiss-Prot or LocusLink (accessed using Gsearch.org) - is justifying further work in this direction.

In this paper we propose an SVM classification approach to predict the two stranded anti-parallel coiled coils structure based on the primary amino acid sequence. The training dataset for the machine learning are collected from SOCKET database which is a SOCKET algorithm predicted coiled coils database. Total 41 sequences of at least two heptad repeats of the two stranded anti-parallel coiled coils motif are extracted from 12 proteins as the positive datasets. Total 37 of non coiled coils sequences and two stranded parallel coiled coils motif are extracted from 5 proteins as negative datasets. The normalized positional weight matrix on each heptad register a, b, c, d, e, f and g is from SOCKET database and is used to generate the positional weight on each entry. We performed SVM classification using the cross-validated datasets as training and testing groups. Our result shows 73% accuracy on the prediction of two stranded anti-parallel coiled coils based on the cross-validated data. The result suggests a useful approach of using SVM to classify the two stranded anti-parallel coiled coils based on the primary amino acid sequence.

The classification problems may be decomposed into two sub-problems, which are feature selection and classifier adaptation. A coevolutionary classification method is designed by coordinating the two sub-problems, whose performances are affected by each other. The proposed method establishes a group of partial subregions, defined by regional feature set, and then fits a finite number of classifiers to the data pattern by combining a genetic algorithm and a local adaptation algorithm in every sub-region. A cycle of the cooperation loop is completed by evolving the sub-regions based on the evaluation results of the fitted classifiers located in the corresponding sub-regions. The classifier system has been tested with well-known data sets from the UCI machine-learning database, showing superior performance to other methods such as the nearest neighbor, decision tree, and neural networks.

The semi-structured data appears in a wide range of applications, such as digital libraries, on-line documentations, electronic commerce. After we have obtained enough data from WWW, we then use data mining method to mine schema knowledge from the data. Therefore, it is very important for us to utilize schema information effectively. This paper proposes a method of schema mining based on fuzzy decision tree to get useful schema information on the web. This algorithm includes three stages, represented using Datalog, incremental clustering, determining using fuzzy decision tree. Using this algorithm, we can discover schema knowledge implicit in the semi-structured data. This knowledge can make users understand the information structure on the web more deeply and thoroughly. At the same time, it can also provide a kind of effective schema for the querying of web information. In the future, we will further the work on extract association rules using machine learning method and study the clustering method in semi-structured data knowledge discovery.

KXtractor is differentiated from other approaches in that (a) it overcomes the problem of the single Part-Of-Speech (POS) HMMs with modeling the rich representation of text where features overlap among state units such as word, line, sentence, and paragraph. By incorporating sentence structures into the learned models, KXtractor provides better extraction accuracy than the single POS HMMs do. (b) It resolves the issues with the traditional HMMs for IE that operate only on the semi-structured data such as HTML documents and other text sources in which language grammar does not play a pivotal role. We compared KXtractor with three IE techniques: 1) RAPIER, an inductive learning-based machine learning system, 2) a Dictionary-based extraction system, and 3) single POS HMM. Our experiments showed that KXtractor outperforms these three IE systems in extracting protein-protein interactions. In our experiments, F-measure for KXtractor was higher than ones for RAPIER, a dictionary-based system, and single POS HMM respectively by 16.89%, 16.28%, and 8.58%. In addition, both precision and recall of KXtractor are higher than those systems.

In this article, we present a research work to enhance the load balancing, on dedicated and non-dedicated cluster configurations, based on a genetic machine learning algorithm. Classifier systems are learning machine algorithms, based on high adaptable genetic algorithms. We developed a software package which was designed to test the proposed scheme in a master-slave Cow and Now environment. Experimental results, from two different operating systems, indicate the enhanced capability of our load balancing approach to adapt in cluster configurations.

Human face recognition by humanoid robots is chosen as the sample application to illustrate the possibility of developmental vision in humanoids. We start with a Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) neural network, which enables the learning of color prototypes and performs human presence detection through skin color segmentation. Then, we choose hidden Markov models for the purpose of both learning and recognition of human facial images, which depend on supervised classification training. As for feature extraction, we propose the method of wavelet packet decomposition.

Instead of using several corpus or several tagger generators to obtain the models needed in stacking, we have applied three transformations to a single training corpus and then we have used the four versions of the corpus to train a single tagger generator. Taking as baseline the results obtained with the original corpus (F-beta=1 value of 81.84), our experiments show that the three transformations improve this baseline (the best one reaches 84.51), and that applying stacking also improves this baseline reaching an F-beta=1 measure of 88.43.

Metaheuristic approaches are becoming very useful for designing efficient tools in Machine Learning. Metaheuristics are general strategies to design efficient heuristic procedures. Scatter Search is a recent metaheuristic that has been successfully applied to solve standard problems in three central paradigms of Machine Learning: Clustering, Classification and Feature Selection. We describe the main components of the Scatter Search metaheuristic and the characteristics of the specific designs to be applied to solve standard problems in these tasks.

In this study, the resource allocation mechanism of AIRS was changed with a new one determined by Fuzzy-Logic rules. This system, named as Fuzzy-AIRS and AIRS were used as classifiers in the classification of outdoor images. The classification of outdoor dataset taken from UCI repository of machine learning databases was done using 10-fold cross validation method. Both versions of AIRS well performed over other systems reported in UCI website for corresponding dataset. Fuzzy-AIRS reached to the classification accuracy of 90.00 % in the applications whereas AIRS obtained 88.20 %. Besides, Fuzzy-AIRS gained one more advantage over AIRS by means of classification time. In the experiments, it was seen that the classification time in Fuzzy-AIRS was reduced by about 67% of AIRS for dataset. Fuzzy-AIRS classifier proved that it can be used as an effective classifier for image classification by reducing classification time as well as obtaining high classification accuracies.

Our approach is based on Support Vector (SV) Machines, which are state of the art in machine learning. It is straightforward to implement and computationally competitive; its parameters can be automatically set using standard machine learning methods. The surface approximation is based on a modified Support Vector regression. We present applications to 3D head reconstruction, including automatic removal of outliers and hole filling. In a second step, we build on our SV representation to compute dense 3D deformation fields between two objects. The fields are computed using a generalized SV Machine enforcing correspondence between the previously learned implicit SV object representations, as well as correspondences between feature points if such points are available. We apply the method to the morphing of 3D heads and other objects.

It is one of the most important indicators of physical or mental diseases of aging patients. In this paper, we present a Wizard of Oz study on the feasibility of detecting social interaction with sensors in skilled nursing facilities. Our study explores statistical models that can be constructed to monitor and analyze social interactions among aging patients and nurses. We are also interested in identifying sensors that might be most useful in interaction detection; and determining how robustly the detection can be performed with noisy sensors. We simulate a wide range of plausible sensors using human labeling of audio and visual data. Based on these simulated sensors, we build statistical models for both individual sensors and combinations of multiple sensors using various machine learning methods. Comparison experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the sensors and statistical models for detecting interactions.

Two hypotheses are proposed. The first is that various types of ST changes can be differentiated using the signal just prior to the ST event. The second is that ischemic ST changes can be differentiated from nonevents, again using the signal prior to the ST event. A machine learning approach, based on Gaussian Mixture Models and maximum likelihood Bayesian classification, is used to analyze the ECG signal. Two sets of feature extraction techniques, reconstructed phase space and Karhunen Loeve transform, are applied, both of which capture morphological characteristics of the ECG signal. The results in addressing the first hypothesis show that information indicative of the type of ST change is present in the signal prior to the onset of the ST event; however the classification accuracy is low. The second hypothesis cannot be affirmed with the results presented here.

The proposed approach is a bootstrapping process that combines ontology and grammar learning, in order to semi-automate the knowledge acquisition process. After providing a survey of the most relevant work towards this goal, recent research of the Software and Knowledge Engineering Laboratory (SKEL) of NCSR "Demokritos" in the areas of Web information integration, information extraction, grammar induction and ontology enrichment is presented. The paper concludes with a number of interesting issues that need to be addressed in order to realize the advocated bootstrapping process..

Scenarios are represented by directed graphs with labeled vertices (for mental actions) and arcs (for temporal and causal relationships between these actions and their parameters). The relation between mental actions and their descriptions gives rise to a concept lattice. Classification of An undetermined scenario is realized by comparing partial matchings of its graph with graphs of positive and negative examples. Developed scenario representation and comparative analysis techniques are applied to the classification of textual customer complaints.

A hybrid genetic algorithm guided by Direct Simplex: Search to evolves hyperparameter values using an empirical error estimate as it steering criterion. This approach is specificaly tailored and experimentally evaluated on a health care problem which involves discriminating 11% nosocomially infected patients from 89% non infected patients. The combination of Direct Search Simplex with GAs is shown to improve the performance of GAs in terms of solution quality, and computational efficiency. Unlike most other hyperparameter timing techniques, our hybrid approach does not require supplementary effort such us computation of derivatives, making them well suited for practical purposes. This method produces encouraging results: it exhibits high performance and good convergence properties.

Abstracts are also used for this purpose. However with. usually more than 300 words, abstracts can still be regarded as long documents; therefore we design a system to select a unique key sentence. This key sentence must be indicative of the article's content and we assume that abstract's conclusions are good candidates. We design and assess the performance of an automatic key sentence selector, which classifies sentences into 4 argumentative moves: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS and CONCLUSION. METHODS: We rely on Bayesian classifiers trained on automatically acquired data. Features representation, selection and weighting are reported and classification effectiveness is evaluated on the four classes using confusion matrices. We also explore the use Of simple heuristics to take the position of sentences into account. Recall, precision and F-scores are computed for the CONCLUSION class. For the CONCLUSION class, the F-score reaches 84%. Automatic argumentative classification is feasible on MEDLINE abstracts and should help user navigation in such repositories.

The knowledge is discovered and accumulated in a rule base with the aid of a genetic based machine learning mechanism. This machine learning mechanism extracts rules for solving the problem with the help of the Evolutionary Programming (EP) algorithm. The retrievals are done using the nearest-classifier-algorithm. This approach provides online solutions for the problem, and establishes a dynamic and evolving environment that adapts with new and sudden changes on the grip specifications or on the external forces. The resulting grasping forces using the presented method are compared with grasping forces obtained using other methods, such as the Complementarity Problems. The proposed online method could update the needed grasping forces to keel) firm grip if the configuration of the forces externally applied to the object is changed. Numerical examples that illustrate the proposed method are presented.

In this algorithm, a boosting method for regression is firstly used to generate ensemble of learners from existing data. And then the average ensemble ambiguity among the element learners in the ensemble is proposed to determine which data point would be labeled by executing experiments. The results of simulations have shown that when the number of experiment is limited, the algorithm is better compared with traditional passive learning algorithms.

The data mining technique described in this paper was used for steam turbine fault diagnostics based on continuous data measurements. The classification rules are based on standardized vibration frequency data for steam turbines and field experts' analyses of turbine vibration problems. The expert knowledge enables the steam turbine fault diagnosis system to be more powerful and accurate. The system can identify twenty types of standard steam turbine faults. The system was developed using 2000 simulated data sets. The data mining methods were then used to identify 20 explicit rules for the turbine faults. The method was also used with actual power plant data to successfully diagnose real faults. The results indicate that data mining can be effectively applied to diagnosis of rotating machinery by giving useful rules to interpret the data.

In this chapter, we begin with an introduction of a recent approach that probabilistically combines multiple information sources to predict protein interactions in yeast. Specifically, Section 5.2 describes the sources of genomic features. Section 5.3 provides a basic tutorial on machine-learning approaches and describes in detail the decision tree and naive Bayesian network that have been used in above study. Section 5.4 discusses the missing value challenges in further development of our existing method. We then shift our attention to discuss protein-protein interactions in the context of networks in Section 5.5, where we present two important network analysis approaches: topology network analysis and modular network analysis. Finally we discuss advantages and key limitations of our method, and our vision of challenges in this area.

However, such data often sacrifice specificity for scale, and thus sophisticated analysis methods are necessary to make accurate predictions of gene function based on large-scale datasets. This chapter presents an overview of unsupervised analysis of microarray data followed by an in-depth discussion of integrated analysis of heterogeneous biological data for accurate gene function prediction. This discussion focuses on a general probabilistic method for such integration, called MAGIC, and provides an overview of the methodology, application and evaluation of this technology.

We highlight some new topics that deserve more attention: testing of differential expression of specific groups of genes, intra-group heterogeneity and class prediction, gene interaction in predictors, visualization, difficulties in the biological interpretation of predictor genes and molecular signatures, and the use of ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve)-based statistics for evaluating predictors and differential expression. We end with a review of some serious problems that can limit the potential of these methods; we focus specially on inadequate assessment of the performance of new methods (due to inadequate estimation of error rates and to the use of few and 'easy' data sets) and failure to recognize observational studies and include needed covariates. A final comment is made about the need for freely available source code.

This problem has been extensively studied under the general subject of discriminant analysis in the statistical literature, or supervised pattern recognition in the machine learning field. Recently, dimension reduction methods, such as SIR and SAVE, have been used for classification purposes. In this paper we propose a regularized version of the SIR method which is able to gain information from both the structure of class means and class variances. Furthermore, the introduction of a shrinkage parameter allows the method to be applied in under-resolution problems, such as those found in gene expression microarray data. The REGSIR method is illustrated on two different classification problems using real data sets.

However, it is tedious and error prone to create an SCD description manually. Moreover, a manually created SCD is not adaptive to the frequent changes of Web sources. It requires its creator to identify all the possible input and output types of a service a priori. In many domains, it is impossible to exhaustively list all the possible input and output data types of a source in advance. In this paper, we describe machine learning approaches for automatic generation of the data types of an SCD. We propose two different approaches for learning data types of a class of Web sources. The Brute-Force Learner is able to generate data types that can achieve high recall, but with low precision. The Clustering-based Learner generates data types that have a high precision rate, but with a lower recall rate. We demonstrate the feasibility of these two learning-based solutions for automatic generation of data types for citation Web sources and presented a quantitative evaluation of these two solutions.

Improved computational algorithms based on the computational invariant theory of finite groups in Euclidean space and a demo application is presented. Progressive model automatic generation is discussed. GEOGINE (c) can be used as an efficient computational kernel for fast reliable application development and delivery in advanced biomedical engineering, biometric, intelligent computing, target recognition, content image retrieval, data mining technological areas mainly. Ontology can be regarded as a logical theory accounting for the intended meaning of a formal dictionary, i.e., its ontological commitment to a particular conceptualization of the world object. According to this approach, "n-D Tensor Calculus" can be considered a "Formal Language" to reliably compute optimized "n-Dimensional Tensor Invariants" as specific object "invariant parameter and attribute words" for automated n-Dimensional shape/texture optimal synthetic object description by incremental model generation. The class of those "invariant parameter and attribute words" can be thought as a specific "Formal Vocabulary" learned from a "Generalized Formal Dictionary" of the "Computational Tensor Invariants" language. Even object chromatic attributes can be effectively and reliably computed from object geometric parameters into robust colour shape invariant characteristics. As a matter of fact, any highly sophisticated application needing effective, robust object geometric/colour invariant attribute capture and parameterization features, for reliable automated object learning and discrimination can deeply benefit from GEOGINE (c) progressive automated model generation computational kernel performance. Main operational advantages over previous, similar approaches are: 1) Progressive Automated Invariant Model Generation, 2) Invariant Minimal Complete Description Set for computational efficiency, 3) Arbitrary Model Precision for robust object description and identification.

Currently, the method of choice for the early detection of breast cancer is mammography. While sensitive to the detection of breast cancer, its positive predictive value (PPV) is low. One of the main deterrents to achieving high computer aided diagnostic (CAD) accuracy is carelessly developed databases. These "noisy" data sets have always appeared to disrupt learning agents from learning correctly. A new statistical method for cleaning data sets was developed that improves the performance of CAD systems. Initial research efforts showed the following: PLS Az value improved by 8.79% and partial Az improved by 49.71%. The K-PLS Az value at Sigma 4.1 improved by 9.18% and the partial Az by 43.47%. The K-PLS at Sigma 3.6 (best fit sigma with this data set) Az value improved by 9.24% and the partial Az by 44.29%. With larger data sets, the ROC curves potentially could look much better than they do now. The Az value for K-PLS (0.892565) is better than PLS, PNN, and most SVMs. The SVM-rbf kernel was the only agent that out performed the K-PLS with an Az value of 0.895362.

However, many discretization algorithms developed in this field focus on the univariate only, which discretize continuous-valued attributes independently, without considering the interdependent relationship between other attributes, at. most taking the class attribute into account. Such univariate discretization is inadequate to handle the critical problems especially owned in the medical domain. In this paper, we propose a new multivariate discretization method called Multivariate Interdependent Discretization for Continuous Attributes - MIDCA. This method incorporates the normalized relief and information measures to look for the best correlated attribute with respect to each continuous-valued attribute being discretized, and using the discovered best correlated attribute as the interdependent attribute to carry out the multivariate discretization. We: believe that a good multivariate discretization scheme for continuous-valued attributes should rely highly on their perfect correlated attributes respectively. Among an attribute space, each attribute should have at least one most relevant attribute that may be different from others. Our novel multivariate discretization algorithm can minimize the uncertainty between the interdependent attribute and the continuous-valued attribute being discretized and at the same time maximize their correlation. Such a method can be used as a pre-processing step for the learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate a comparison of performance between MIDCA and various discretization methods for two decision tree algorithms ID3 and C4.5 on twelve real-life datasets from UCI repository.

One major drawback of the small computing devices is their small screen (e.g., PDA's and smartphones) that makes it harder to view large amounts of information. The problem is even worse given the flood of information today's users are facing in their daily tasks. This paper presents LAKE, a flexible summarization system consisting of different independent linguistic modules that can easily be configured and parameterized. The system can be used to reduce the amount of information viewed by users of small-screen devices while maintaining its essence. The system works as follows: a set of linguistically motivated candidate phrases is identified. A learning device then chooses the best phrases. Finally, phrases at the top of the ranking are merged to form a summary. LAKE is tested within the framework of eSMEs, a joint Project of Italdata S.p.A.

The introduction of on-board electronic systems and the growth of electronic based functions have made the reparability very difficult for after-sales vehicle technicians. This paper introduces a decision tree classifier in order to detect and isolate after-sales failures on a vehicle. It uses binary data generated by vehicle on-board electronic control units. By selecting a one-against-all decision tree structure, we demonstrate that it is possible to classify instances which may belong simultaneously, with full certainty, to more than one class. The presence of several classes corresponds to the presence of several vehicle failures at the same time. Tree complexity is reduced and overfitting is avoided by applying Error Based Pruning method (EBP). The different tree outputs are combined in a decision system in order to classify an instance into one or several known classes or to consider the instance as belonging to an unknown class. The introduced method has been tested on a real data set. The obtained results demonstrate the good performances and the adapted structure of this classifier.

Based on a limited number of factors from medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, the practitioners use these rules to expedite diagnosis and treatment for serious cases and limit unnecessary tests for low-probability cases. However, before the rules can be used in clinics, they must be validated on large and diversified populations and evaluated in clinical settings. A computer system providing intelligent data analysis and data mining techniques can facilitate this lengthy and costly process. This paper describes a conceptual framework and a prototype system for the rule evaluation process. The study concentrates on predictive rules used in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common and serious respiratory disorder. The prototype system, Hypnos, includes (1) a framework for rule definition, and (2) a mechanism for rule evaluation. The rule definition framework is based on a semiotic and a fuzzy logic approach. The semiotic description incorporates a rule's syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The fuzzy logic models the imprecise features. The rule evaluation mechanism supports first the validation and then comparison of the rules built by the domain experts and the rules generated by the data-driven method. The results from both methods are compared based on rule accuracy, interpretability, generality, and clinical utility. The prediction rules for OSA are described and evaluated using four datasets (1,300 records) from two clinics. The results show that rules obtained from data mining can confirm, contradict, or expand the rules created by medical experts. Therefore, the paper suggests a combination of knowledge-driven and data-driven methods for rule derivation and validation.

Images of these particles can now be obtained in-line during processing. A Bayesian classification model was previously shown to be capable of distinguishing images containing a contaminant particle from those that did not [1]. However, new processing conditions cause changes in the background "noise" in the acquired images which necessitate retraining of the model. This paper demonstrates how a recently presented method of adaptive machine learning, termed the "Intelligent Learning Machine" (ILM) [2], [3], was successfully used to enable the classification model to adapt to such changes in image quality. The use of the ILM permitted this to be accomplished with great efficiency and flexibility without interrupting the process monitoring.

Most existing data-mining algorithms assume that the database is static, and a database update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new data. While there are many efficient mining techniques for data additions to databases, in this paper, we propose a decremental algorithm for pattern discovery when data is being deleted from databases. We conduct extensive experiments for evaluating this approach, and illustrate that the proposed algorithm can well model and capture useful interactions within data when the data is decreasing.

The essence of success in these applications is the spectral information that captures the semantics inherent in the large amount of data required during unsupervised learning. In this paper, we ask if spectral methods can also be used in supervised learning, e.g., classification. In an attempt to answer this question, our research reveals a novel kernel in which spectral clustering information can be easily exploited and extended to new incoming data during classification tasks. From our experimental results, the proposed Spectral Kernel has proved to speedup classification tasks without compromising accuracy.

Based on the principle of natural evolution and global searching, a genetic algorithm is promising in obtaining better results. This article adopts learning classifier systems (LCS) technique to provide a three-phase knowledge extraction methodology, which makes continues and instant learning while integrates multiple rule sets into a centralized knowledge base. This paper makes three important contributions: (1) it represents various rule sets that are derived from different sources and encoded as a fixed-length bit string in the knowledge encoding phase; (2) it uses three criteria (accuracy, coverage, and fitness) to select an optimal set of rules from a large population in the knowledge extraction phase; (3) it applies genetic operations to generate optimal rule sets in the knowledge integration phase. The experiments prove the rule sets derived by the proposed approach is more accurate than other machine learning algorithm.

Summarizing these texts can aid the users access the information content at a faster pace. However, doing this task manually is expensive and time-consuming. Automatic text summarization is a solution for dealing with this problem. For a given text, a text summarization algorithm selects a few salient sentences based on certain features. In the literature, weight-based, foci-based, and machine learning approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a popularity-based approach for text summarization. A popularity of the sentence is determined based on the number of other sentences similar to it. Using the notion of popularity, it is possible to extract potential sentences for summarization that could not be extracted by the. existing approaches. The experimental results show that by applying both popularity and weight-based criteria it is possible to extract effective summaries.

While the infrastructure components are usually developed by experienced programmers with solid security skills, the application-specific code is often developed under strict time constraints by programmers with little security training. As a result, vulnerable web-applications are deployed and made available to the Internet at large, creating easily-exploitable entry points for the compromise of entire networks. Web-based applications often rely on back-end database servers to manage application-specific persistent state. The data is usually extracted by performing queries that are assembled using input provided by the users of the applications. If user input is not sanitized correctly, it is possible to mount a variety of attacks that leverage web-based applications to compromise the security of back-end databases. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to identify these attacks using signature-based intrusion detection systems, because of the ad hoc nature of many web-based applications. Signatures are rarely written for this class of applications due to the substantial investment of time and expertise this would require. We have developed an anomaly-based system that learns the profiles of the normal database access performed by web-based applications using a number of different models. These models allow for the detection of unknown attacks with reduced false positives and limited overhead. In addition, our solution represents an improvement with respect to previous approaches because it reduces the possibility of executing SQL-based mimicry attacks.

The key challenge of this problem is to be able to recognize any member of a category of objects in spite of wide variations in visual appearance due to variations in the form and colour of the object, occlusions, geometrical transformations (such as scaling and rotation), changes in illumination, and potentially non-rigid deformations of the object itself. In this paper we focus on the detection of objects within images by combining information from a large number of small regions, or 'patches', of the image. Since detailed hand-segmentation and labelling of images is very labour intensive, we make use of 'weakly labelled' data in which the training images are labelled only according to the presence or absence of each category of object. A major challenge presented by this problem is that the foreground object is accompanied by widely varying background clutter, and the system must learn to distinguish the foreground from the background without the aid of labelled data. In this paper we first show that patches which are highly relevant for the object discrimination problem can be selected automatically from a large dictionary of candidate patches during learning, and that this leads to improved classification compared to direct use of the full dictionary. We then explore alternative techniques which are able to provide labels for the individual patches, as well as for the image as a whole, so that each patch is identified as belonging to one of the object categories or to the background class. This provides a rough indication of the location of the object or objects within the image. Again these individual patch labels must be learned on the basis only of overall image class labels. We develop two such approaches, one discriminative and one generative, and compare their performance both in terms of patch labelling and image labelling. Our results show that good classification performance can be obtained on challenging data sets using only weak training labels, and they also highlight some of the relative merits of discriminative and generative approaches.

The observations we make are then taken to be related to these sources through some unknown functionaility. Furthermore, the (unknown) number of underlying latent sources may be different to the number of observations and hence issues of model complexity plague the analysis. Recent developments in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have shown that, in the case where the unknown function linking sources to observations is linear, data decomposition may be achieved in a mathematically elegant manner. In this paper we extend the general ICA paradigm to include a very flexible source model and prior constraints and argue that for particular biomedical signal processing problems (we consider EEG analysis) we require the constraint of positivity in the mixing process.

In this case, two questions naturally arise: what does it mean for two inputs to be similar and how can this be used in a learning algorithm? In support vector machines, similarity between input examples is implicitly expressed by a kernel function that calculates inner products in the feature space. For numerical input examples the concept of an inner product is easy to define, for discrete structures like sequences of symbolic data however these concepts are less obvious. This article describes an approach to SVM learning for symbolic data that can serve as an alternative to the bag-of-words approach under certain circumstances. This latter approach first transforms symbolic data to vectors of numerical data which are then used as arguments for one of the standard kernel functions. In contrast, we will propose kernels that operate on the symbolic data directly.

In either cases, a large volume of results are returned of which, the results relevant to the user are not often among the top few. Re-ranking of the search results according to the user's interest based on his relevance feedback, has received wide attention in information retrieval. Also, recent work in collaborative filtering and information retrieval has shown that sharing of search experiences among users having similar interests, typically called a community, reduces the effort put in by any given user in retrieving the exact information of interest. In this paper, we propose a collaborative filtering based reranking strategy for the search processes in a digital library system. Our approach is to learn a user profile representing user's interests using Machine Learning techniques and to re-rank the search results based on collaborative filtering techniques. In particular, we investigate the use of Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbour methods (kNN) for the task of classification. We also apply this approach to a large scale online Digital Library System and present the results of our evaluation.

Instead of choosing a priori a particular model class of BNCs, our adaptive algorithm scales up the model's complexity by gradually increasing the number of allowable dependencies among features, Starting with the simple Naive Bayes structure, it uses simple decision rules based on qualitative information about the performance's dynamics to decide when it makes sense to do the next move in the spectrum of feature dependencies and to start searching for a more complex classifier. Results in conducted experiments using the class of Dependence Bayesian Classifiers on three large datasets show that our algorithm is able to select a model with the appropriate complexity for the current amount of training data, thus balancing the computational cost of updating a model with the benefits of increasing in accuracy.

We propose a general method for constructing kernels for Support Vector Inductive Logic Programming (SVILP). The kernel not only captures the semantic and syntactic relational information contained in the data but also provides the flexibility of using arbitrary forms of structured and non-structured data coded in a relational way. While specialised kernels have been developed for strings, trees and graphs our approach uses declarative background knowledge to provide the learning bias. The use of explicitly encoded background knowledge distinguishes SVILP from existing relational kernels which in ILP-terms work purely at the atomic generalisation level. The SVILP approach is a form of generalisation relative to background knowledge, though the final combining function for the ILP-learned clauses is an SVM rather than a logical conjunction. We evaluate SVILP empirically against related approaches, including an industry-standard toxin predictor called TOPKAT. Evaluation is conducted on a new broad-ranging toxicity dataset (DSSTox). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all other approaches in the study.

The semantic roles were realized in various sets of syntactic features used by a machine learning model to explore what should be the efficient way in allowing this knowledge to provide the highest positive effect on the NER. The empirical results show that the best feature set consists of predicate's surface form, predicate's lemma, voice, and the united feature of subject-object head's lemma and transitive-intransitive sense. The performance improvement from using these features indicates the advantage of the predicate-argument semantic knowledge on NER. There are still rooms to enhance NER by using this semantic knowledge (e.g. to employ other semantic roles besides agent and theme and to extend the rules for efficient identification of an argument's boundary).

This paper formalizes a class of problems of learning from ontology and data, and explores the design space of learning classifiers from attribute value taxonomies (AVTs) and data. We introduce the notion of AVT-extended data sources and partially specified data. We propose a general framework for learning classifiers from such data sources. Two instantiations of this framework, AVT-based Decision Tree classifier and AVT-based Naive Bayes classifier are presented. Experimental results show that the resulting algorithms are able to learn robust high accuracy classifiers with substantially more compact representations than those obtained by standard learners.

Stemming was used to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. The accuracy of the classifier was tested by carrying out several categorization tasks on an in-house collected Arabic corpus. The results show that the proposed classifier is very accurate and robust.

At present, there have existed many algorithms of discretization. The main problem of them is that the choice of breakpoints which influence the effect of discretization deeply is random. The optimal discretization has been proved to be NP-hard. A great majority of algorithms of discretization adopt heuristics which is hard to get satisfied discrete effect. Based on the theory of Rough Set this thesis firstly discusses the problems above then puts forward a new algorithm based on clustering of mean and importance of attributes.

In particular, we test and compare support vector machines, conditional maximum entropy models and Naive Bayes with kernel density estimates and explore their behaviors and properties when solving this problem. We focus on a whole word problem to avoid having to do character segmentation which is difficult with degraded handwritten documents. Our results on a publicly available standard dataset of 20 pages of George Washington's manuscripts show that Naive Bayes with Gaussian kernel density estimates significantly outperforms the other models and prior work using hidden Markov models on this heavily unbalanced dataset.

We do this by classifying individual character images to determine the language boundaries in multilingual documents. Two effective methods are considered for this purpose: the prototype classification method and support vector machines (SVM). Due to the large size of our training data-set, we further propose a technique to speed up the training process for both methods. Applying the two methods to classifying characters into Chinese, English, and Japanese (including Hiragana and Katakana) has produced very accurate and comparable test results.

However, low resolution cameras present a challenge to OCR because it is virtually impossible to do character segmentation independently from recognition. In this paper we solve these problems simultaneously by applying methods borrowed from cursive handwriting recognition. To achieve maximum robustness, we use a machine learning approach based on a convolutional neural network. When our system is combined with a language model using dynamic programming, the overall performance is in the vicinity of 80-95% word accuracy on pages captured with a 1024x 768 webcam and 10-point text.

The popularization of Graphic Processing Units (GPVs), which are now available on every PC, provides an attractive alternative. We propose a generic 2-layer fully connected neural network GPU implementation which yields over 3X speedup for both training and testing with respect to a 3GHz P4 CPU.

A data set which contains observations for calibrated flaws is used to learn the processing. This learning problem is addressed in the context of small size data set. This is why a large reduction of the observation space dimension has to be carried out in order to avoid the overfitting problem, especially famous in the machine learning field. The dimension reduction is achieved by building a descriptor set from the observations. The paper shows that by selecting the descriptors among the components, issuing from a Principal Component Analysis performed on observations, the overfitting risk is avoided. The search of the optimal subset is achieved with a branch and bound algorithm because an exhaustive search would not be tractable for computational reasons. The precision and the robustness of the proposed approach are evaluated in order to prove the effectiveness of the approach.

So far, most of the ubiquitous systems process knowledge in problem-specific or domain-specific manners. This article introduces the concept of context knowledge discovery process, and presents a middleware architecture which eases the task of ubiquitous computing developers, while supporting data mining and machine learning techniques. We show how the middleware architecture supports building ubiquitous systems which are able to "learn" and "think" by introducing some learning - reasoning combination mechanisms, such as the context recognition and prediction, or the deductive rule learning and reasoning process(1).

On the one hand, the learner must be plastic enough to adapt to the new data. On the other hand, it must be stable enough to integrate information. In this paper, we try to resolve this problem using neural network trees (NNTrees), An NNTree is a decision tree (DT) with each non-terminal node containing an expert neural network (ENN). The NNTrees are plastic because they can adapt to the new data through retraining of the ENNs and/or through generation of new nodes. The NNTrees are also stable because retraining is performed partially and locally. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can grow NNTrees effectively and efficiently. Experiments with several public databases show that the NNTrees obtained by the proposed methods are comparable with the NNTrees or DTs obtained with all data provided all-at-once.

However, the previous mechanisms based on machine learning have some disadvantages such as high false positive rate and computing overhead. In this paper, we propose a new DDoS detection model based on multiple SVMs (Support Vector Machine) in order to reduce the false positive rate. We employ TRA (Traffic Rate Analysis) to analyze the characteristics of network traffic for DDoS attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed model is a highly useful classifier for detecting DDoS attacks.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) has drawn great interests recently as one of the best classifiers in machine learning. In this paper, we develop an iris recognition system using SVM to classify the acquired features series. Even though the SVM outperforms most of other classifiers, it works slowly, which may hinder its application in embedded systems, where resources are usually limited. To make the SVM more applicable in embedded systems, we make several optimizations, including Active Learning, Kernel Selection and Negative Samples Reuse Strategy. Experimental data show that the method presented is amenable: the speed is 5 times faster and the correct recognition rate is almost the same as the basic SVM. This work makes iris recognition more feasible in embedded systems. Also, the optimized SVM can be widely applied in other similar fields.

Bayesian approaches to segmentation use priors to impose spatial coherence; the discrete nature of segmentation demands priors defined on discrete-valued fields, thus leading to difficult combinatorial problems. This paper presents a formulation which allows using continuous priors, namely Gaussian fields, for image segmentation. Our approach completely avoids the combinatorial nature of standard Bayesian approaches to segmentation. Moreover, it's completely general, i.e., it can be used in supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised modes, with any probabilistic observation model (intensity, multispectral, or texture features). To use continuous priors for image segmentation, we adopt a formulation which is common in Bayesian machine learning: introduction of hidden fields to which the region labels are probabilistically related. Since these hidden fields are real-valued, we can adopt any type of spatial prior for continuous-valued fields, such as Gaussian priors. We show how, under this model, Bayesian MAP segmentation is carried out by a (generalized) EM algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real data shows that the proposed approach performs very well at a low computational cost.

This relaxation of training target from the coni ventional binary values to disjoint classification spaces provides good classification fidelity according to a threshold treatment during the decision process.

The efficiency of the SVM is determined by the number of support vectors, which is usually large for representing a highly convoluted separation hypersurface. We noted that the separation hypersurface is made unnecessarily over-convoluted around extreme outliers, which dominate the objective function of SVM. To suppress the domination from extreme outliers and thus relatively simplify the shape of separation hypersurface, we propose a method of adaptively penalizing the outliers in the objective function. Since our reformulated objective function has the similar format of the standard SVM, the idea of the existing SVM training algorithms is borrowed for training the proposed SVM. Our proposed method has been tested on the UCI machine learning repository, as well as a real clinical problem, i.e., tissue classification in prostate ultrasound images. Experimental results show that our method is able to dramatically increase the classification efficiency of the SVM, without losing its generalization ability.

At the same time, our approach can reduce dimensionality by constructing more relevant attributes. Fitness of each projection measures how easy is to classify the dataset after applying the projection. This is quickly computed by a Simple Linear Perceptron. We have tested our approach in three domains. The experiments show that it obtains good results, compared to other Machine Learning approaches, while reducing dimensionality in many cases.

Word sense disambiguation is a current area of investigation in which verbs have the dominant role. Generally verbs have more senses than the other types of words in the average and detecting these features for verbs may lead to some improvements for other word types. In this paper we have considered only the syntactical features that can be obtained from the corpus and tested by using some famous machine learning algorithms.

A great challenge for data mining activity is the generation of large number of potential rules as a result of mining process. In fact sometimes result size is comparable to the original data. Traditional data mining pruning activities such as support do not sufficiently reduce the huge rule space. Moreover, many practical applications are characterized by continual change of data and knowledge, thereby making knowledge voluminous with each change. The most predominant representation of the discovered knowledge is the standard Production Rules (PRs) in the form If P Then D. Michalski & Winston proposed Censored Production Rules (CPRs), as an extension of production rules, that exhibit variable precision and supports an efficient mechanism for handling exceptions. A CPR is an augmented production rule of the form: If P Then D Unless C, where C (Censor) is an exception to the rule. Such rules are employed in situations in which the conditional statement 'If P Then D' holds frequently and the assertion C holds rarely. By using a rule of this type we are free to ignore the exception conditions, when the resources needed to establish its presence, are tight or there is simply no information available as to whether it holds or not. Thus the 'If P Then D' part of the CPR expresses important information while the Unless C part acts only as a switch changes the polarity of D to similar to D. In this paper a scheme based on Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) interpretation of a CPR is suggested for discovering CPRs from the discovered flat PRs. The discovery of CPRs from flat rules would result in considerable reduction of the already discovered rules. The proposed scheme incrementally incorporates new knowledge and also reduces the size of knowledge base considerably with each episode. Examples are given to demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed scheme. The suggested cumulative learning scheme would be useful in mining data streams.

Several chemical mechanisms have been proposed for regional air quality models. The atmospheric chemical mechanisms are the most computationally intensive components of the photochemical air quality simulation models. Lumping of atmospheric chemical species into different groups is one of the effective techniques used to reduce the complexity of the reaction mechanisms. This paper deals with the development of a system which is used to lump the atmospheric hydrocarbons into different groups by a functional group approach. Since lumping of chemical species into different categories is a classification problem, we have identified from the computational prospective that the application of machine learning by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as appropriate to solve the problem. The conventional notation used to represent chemical species is not in a form which can be given directly as an input for the machine learning. SMILES notation (Weininger, 1988. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science. 28, 31-36) is used to represent the chemical species and can be converted to an internal Bond-Electron (BE) connectivity matrix notation (cf. Broadbelt, 1994. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research. 33, 790-799) which describes the connectivity of atoms within the molecule. The outputs in the output layer of the ANN are the lumped categories desired. We also consider the issues such as what type of chemical information is appropriate and how best to give this chemical information as input for ANN to obtain accurate results in classifying the chemical species into different lumped patterns.

However, those systems involve tasks that indirectly map to simple binary commands such as "yes" or "no" or require many weeks of biofeedback training. We hypothesized that signal processing and machine learning methods can be used to discriminate EEG in a direct "yes"/"no" BCI from a single session. Blind source separation (BSS) and spectral transformations of the EEG produced a 180-dimensional feature space. We used a modified genetic algorithm (GA) wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to search the space of feature subsets. The GA-based search found feature subsets that outperform full feature sets and random feature subsets. Also, BSS transformations of the EEG outperformed the original time series, particularly in conjunction with a subset search of both spaces. The results suggest that BSS and feature selection can be used to improve the performance of even a "direct," single-session BCl.

A crucial property of all approaches is that they have the ability to adapt the controller to accommodate changes in the process. That means that the controller maintains a required level of performance in spite of noise and fluctuation in the process. The paper focuses on model reference adaptive controllers based on Lyapunov adaptive law. The named adaptive controller in some cases has a little level of performance regarding conventional controller. In order to improve the controller performance behavioral cloning is used. In the behavioral cloning, the system learns from control traces of a human operator. The advantage of the named approach ties in simplicity with regard to the controller parameters tune up in order to reach an appropriate performance.

However, recognition performances reported today are mostly not sufficient for a real usage within working systems. Therefore we want to improve on this challenge by evolutionary programming. As a starting point we use prosodic, voice quality and articulatory feature contours. We next propose systematic derivation of functionals by means of descriptive statistics. In order to analyze cross-feature information and feature permutations we use Genetic Algorithms, as a complete coverage of possible alterations is NP-hard. The final attribute set is at the same time optimized by reduction to the most relevant information in order to reduce complexity for the classifier and ensure real-time capability during extraction process. Classification is fulfilled by diverse machine learning methods for utmost discrimination power. We decided for two public databases, namely the Berlin Emotional Speech Database, and the Danish Emotional Speech Corpus for test-runs. These clearly show the high effectiveness of the suggested approach.

Information thus tracked can be utilized to efficiently operate the Supply chain. An efficient Supply chain is Of paramount importance for smooth operation of any eCommerce system. One of the problems encountered while reading RFID tags is that of collision, which Occurs when multiple tags transmit data to the same receiver slot. Data loss due to collision necessitates re-transmission of lost data. We consider this problem from Framed Slotted Aloha protocol.

In order to represent, analyze and Visualize effectively the ignition processes advanced computational techniques will be required. Recently, we introduced a novel concept that captured the principal elemental transformations in complex kinetic environments in the form of graphs. In order to arrive at a compact representation of the information content of these graphs novel concepts from machine learning, such as feature selection in time series and hashing, are implemented. These approaches allow the projection of the totality of the information contained in the graph describing the chemical transformations onto a single scalar. The temporally evolving graphs are treated as streaming data and locality-preserving hashing allows the unique assignment of a scalar "motif" value to each such graph. Analysis of those motifs allows the quick identification of "clusters" of identical reaction graphs that correspond to regimes with similar kinetic histories. The approach is illustrated with highly complex kinetic mechanisms describing pentane autoignition. It is demonstrated how this novel representation allows the quick identification of regions where similar temporal history of the chernical transformations is experienced.

By allowing the simultaneous monitoring of the expression of the entire genome for a given organism, array experiments provide tremendous insight into the fundamental biological processes that translate genetic information. One of the major challenges is to identify computationally efficient and biologically meaningful analysis approaches to extract the most informative and unbiased components of the microarray data. In this paper we introduce a framework that integrates machine learning and optimization techniques for the selection of maximally informative genes in microarray expression experiments. The proposed approach provides tremendous reduction in the number of informative genes, compared to similar analyses by generating biologically relevant minimal Subsets of genes.

We have developed a tool (called PHASuite) to assist experts conducting process safety analysis. PHA is knowledge intensive, and the analysis capacity and quality of PHASuite depend exclusively on the quality of domain knowledge. It is, however, impossible and impractical to encode all kinds of knowledge into the knowledge base during development phase of PHASuite. Thus, the major aim of this work is to address the important practical learning needs. The learning-from-experience strategy using case-based reasoning methodologies and learning from data using Bayesian learning, are investigated.

The need to accelerate optimisation for such problems has not so far been seriously tackled. However, this is a very important issue, since as MOEAs become more and more recognised as the 'industry standard' technique for water system design, the demands placed on such systems (larger and larger water networks) will quickly meet with problems of scaleup. Meanwhile, LEM (Learnable Evolution Model') has appeared in the Machine Learning literature, and provides a general approach to integrating machine learning into evolutionary search. Published results using LEM show very great promise in terms of finding near-optimal solutions with significantly reduced numbers of evaluations. Here we introduce LEMMO (Learnable Evolution Model for Multi-Objective optimization), which is a multiobjective adaptation of LEM, and we apply it to certain problems commonly used as benchmarks in the water systems community. Compared with NSGA-II, we find that LEMMO both significantly improves performance, and significantly reduces the number of evaluations needed to reach a given target. We conclude that the general approach used in LEMMO is a promising direction for meeting the scale-up challenges in multiobjective water system design.

Addressing this problem effectively has many practical applications, e.g., elimination of duplicate records in databases and citation matching for scholarly articles. In this paper we consider a new domain where the record linkage problem is manifested: Internet comparison shopping. We address the resulting linkage setting that requires learning a similarity function between record pairs from streaming data. The learned similarity function is subsequently used in clustering to determine which records are co-referent and should be linked. We present an online machine learning method for addressing this problem, where a composite similarity function based on a linear combination of basis functions is learned incrementally. We illustrate the efficacy of this approach on several real-world datasets from an Internet comparison shopping site, and show that our method is able to effectively learn various distance functions for product data with differing characteristics. We also provide experimental results that show the importance of considering multiple performance measures in record link-age evaluation.

Since its conditional independence assumption is rarely true, researchers have made a substantial amount of effort to improve naive Bayes. The related research work can be broadly divided into two approaches: eager learning and lazy learning, depending on when the major computation occurs. Different from eager approach, the key idea for extending naive Bayes from the lazy approach is to learn a naive Bayes for each testing example. In recent years, some lazy extensions of naive Bayes have been proposed. For example, SNNB[18], LWNB[7], and LBR[19]. All are aiming at improving the classification accuracy of naive Bayes. In many real-world machine learning and data mining applications, however an accurate ranking is more desirable than an accurate classification. Responding to this fact, we present a lazy learning algorithm called instance greedily cloning naive Bayes (simply IGCNB) in this paper Our motivation is to improve naive Bayes' ranking performance measured by AUC[4, 14]. We experimentally tested our algorithm, using the whole 36 UCI datasets recommended by Weka[1], and compared it to C4.4[16], NB[12], SNNB[18] and LWNB[7]. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms used to compare significantly in yielding accurate ranking.

A key subprocess is evaluating how well the individual fields, or attributes, of the records match each other One approach to matching fields is to use hand-written domain-specific rules. This "expert systems" approach may result in good performance for specific applications, but it is not scalable. This paper describes a new machine learning approach that creates expert-like rules for field matching. In our approach, the relationship between two field values is described by a set of heterogeneous transformations. Previous machine learning methods used simple models to evaluate the distance between two fields. However, our approach enables more sophisticated relationships to be modeled, which better capture the complex domain specific, common-sense phenomena that humans use to judge similarity. We compare our approach to methods that rely on simpler homogeneous models in several domains. By modeling more complex relationships we produce more accurate results.

Many conventional active learning algorithms focus on refining the decision boundary, at the expense of exploring new regions that the current hypothesis misclassifies. We propose a new active learning algorithm that balances such exploration with refining of the decision boundary by dynamically adjusting the probability to explore at each step. Our experimental results demonstrate improved performance on data sets that require extensive exploration while remaining competitive on data sets that do not.

A supervised tensor learning (STL) framework is established for convex optimization based learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVM) and minimax probability machines (M P M). Within the STL framework, many conventional learning machines can be generalized to take n(th)-order tensors as inputs. We also study the applications of tensors to learning machine design and feature extraction by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Our method for tensor based feature extraction is named the tenor rank-one discriminant analysis (TRIDA). These generalized algorithms have several advantages: 1) reduce the curse of dimension problem in machine learning and data mining; 2) avoid the failure to converge; and 3) achieve better separation between the different categories of samples. As an example, we generalize MPM to its STL version, which is named the tensor MPM (TMPM). TMPM learns a series of tensor projections iteratively. It is then evaluated against the original MPM. Our experiments on a binary classification problem show that TMPM significantly outperforms the original MPM.

It however suffers from the small sample size (SSS) problem when data dimensionality is greater than the sample size. Many modified methods have been proposed to address some aspect of this difficulty from a particular viewpoint. A comprehensive framework that provides a complete solution to the SSS problem is still missing. In this paper we provide a unified approach to LDA, and investigate the SSS problem in the framework of statistical learning theory. In such a unified approach, our analysis results in a deeper understanding of LDA. We demonstrate that LDA (and its nonlinear extension) belongs to the same framework where powerful classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) are formulated. In addition, this approach allows us to establish an error bound for LDA. Finally our experiments validate our theoretical analysis results.

Outlier detection has many applications, such as data cleaning, fraud detection and network intrusion. The existence of outliers can indicate individuals or groups that exhibit a behavior that is very different from most of the individuals of the dataset. In this paper we design two parallel algorithms, the first one is for finding out distance-based outliers based on nested loops along with randomization and the use of a pruning rule. The second parallel algorithin is for detecting density-based local outliers. In both cases data parallelism is used. We show that both algorithms reach near linear speedup. Our algorithms are tested on four real-world datasets coining front the Machine Learning Database Repository at the UCI.

Such ability is possible when the Web pages are properly annotated. For newly developed Semantic Web resources, such annotation can be done manually or by help of sophisticated authoring tools. However it is not practical to semantically annotating existing Web pages due to the gigantic amount of them. To bridge the gap between the Semantic Web and the World Wide Web, we propose a machine learning approach to automatically generate semantic markups for traditional Web pages. The proposed method applies the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster training Web pages and conducts a text mining process to discover the words to be tagged and their semantic descriptions. Preliminary experiments show that our method may succesfully generate semantical markups for the Web pages.

In genomic applications, the researcher deals with noisy and complex high-dimensional feature spaces; a wealth of genes whose expression levels are experimentally measured, can often be observed for just a few time points, thus limiting the available samples. This unbalanced combination suggests that it might be hard for standard statistical inference techniques to come up with good general solutions, likewise for machine learning algorithms to avoid heavy computational work. Thus, one naturally turns to two major aspects of the problem: sparsity and intrinsic dimensionality. These two aspects are studied in this paper, where for both denoising and dimensionality reduction, a very efficient technique, i.e., Independent Component Analysis, is used. The numerical results are very promising, and lead to a very good quality of gene feature selection, due to the signal separation power enabled by the decomposition technique. We investigate how the use of replicates can improve these results, and deal with noise through a stabilization strategy which combines the estimated components and extracts the most informative biological information from them. Exploiting the inherent level of sparsity is a key issue in genetic regulatory networks, where the connectivity matrix needs to account for the real links among genes and discard many redundancies. Most experimental evidence suggests that real gene-gene connections represent indeed a subset of what is usually mapped onto either a huge gene vector or a typically dense and highly structured network. Inferring gene network connectivity from the expression levels represents a challenging inverse problem that is at present stimulating key research in biomedical engineering and system biology. Several attempts have been made to describe gene networks with only limited interactions, thus exploiting the inherent sparsity of these systems. This in turn suggests that a certain redundancy of links in gene networks, or equivalently the inherent sparsity structure of these systems, might let the essential connections be identified and the inverse problem be given both satisfactory definition and computationally efficient tractability.

When learning on such data, it is important to use models that are not strongly biased against properties of the data, or the variable assignments learned may be largely incorrect. We are working with data sources for user interface event data and examining the applicability of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to context tracking. Specifically, we identify the value and transition points of a hidden task variable; this problem is known as segmentation. Our data is drawn from command line interaction collected in a real work setting and window event traces taken during a controlled behavioral study. We have applied discrete time hidden Markov models (HMMs) and DBNs to these data sets, but these methods are fundamentally Markovian and, as a result, cannot correctly learn the properties of hidden variables with nongeometrically distributed dwell times. We believe that using semi-Markov models may better capture some underlying structure and allow for better segmentation. In this paper, we describe the experimental protocols performed, examine the bias of typical DBNs and HMMs towards geometric variable dwell times, and assess the validity of this assumption. We discuss the issues of applying semi-Markov DBNs to the available data.

The purpose of the classifier is to provide physical context to a separate system that mitigates unnecessary distractions, allowing the driver to maintain focus during periods of high difficulty. While watching videos of driving, we asked different users to indicate their perceptions of the current situation. We then trained a classifier to emulate the human recognition of driving situations using the Sandia Cognitive Framework. In unstructured conditions, such as driving in urban areas and the German autobahn, the classifier was able to correctly predict human perceptions of driving situations over 95% of the time. This paper focuses on the learning algorithms used to train the driving-situation classifier. Future work will reduce the human efforts needed to train the system.

B	Diethe, T		Schmorrow, DD		Diethe, T			HCI International 2005 - The future of augmentation managers	Foundations of Augmented Cognition, Vol 11			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Augmented Cognition held in Conjunction with the 11th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	JUL 22-27, 2005	Las Vegas, NV			Augmentation Manager; closed-loop system; adaptive automation; Cognitive Cockpit; mitigation strategies	SYSTEMS	In every Augmented Cognition (AugCog) application, where a closed-loop architecture is implemented, there is a requirement for a system that is responsible for the implementation of the strategies designed to mitigate the effects of excessive workload. The manner by which these mitigation strategies are implemented is likely to be platform specific, however several generic principles may be defined which enable the outputs of operator state gauges to be interpreted and acted upon. In the simplest configuration an Augmentation Manager is designed to implement a single or number of mitigation strategies based on a single, high-level descriptor of operator state. In the initial implementation of the Tasking Interface Manager (TIM) in our Cognitive Cockpit (CogPit) the output of a single gauge, executive workload, was passed through a linear filter and a simple thresholding algorithm employed to trigger the implementation of a number of mitigation strategies. Whilst this showed some benefits during our first set of closed-loop trials, it is likely that this approach oversimplifies the problem. In particular, this approach did not take account of the complex relationship between mitigation strategies and state. In addition, any system that employs this, or similar techniques, will be purely reactive rather than proactive. Here we propose a multifaceted approach, in which the outputs of multiple gauges, operator state forecasting and context modeling together with a prediction of the effects of mitigation strategies on operator status will be used to drive the targeted application of a number of mitigation strategies. Achieving this will require a major engineering effort and carefully constructed empirical research. Furthermore it is apparent that in order to make AugCog systems truly intelligent and adaptive, they will need to be able to monitor their own performance and adapt as necessary. Future systems will also need to be adaptive to the context in which they are operating, enabling the appropriate responses to unfamiliar contextual cues to be made. These occurrences should be stored in order to improve system operation under similar conditions should they arise again. This machine learning element to AugCog systems is probably the most underdeveloped area, but potentially could provide huge benefits to their long-term operational functionality.

Usually, multiple mappings can be obtained from an instance information system. A set of mappings, which are created based on multiple reducts in the instance information system by means of rough set theory, is defined as multi-knowledge in this paper. Uncertain rules are introduced to represent multi-knowledge. A hybrid approach of multi-knowledge and the Naive Bayes Classifier is proposed to make decisions for unseen instances or for instances with missing attribute values. The data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are applied to test this decision-making algorithm. The experimental results show that the decision accuracies for unseen instances are higher than by using other approaches in a single body of knowledge.

In this paper, a normalized graph sampling algorithm for clustering that improves the solution of clustering via the incorporation of a priori constraint in a stochastic graph sampling procedure is adopted. The important question of how many clusters exists in the dataset and when to terminate the clustering algorithm is solved via computing the ensemble average change in entropy. Experimental results show the feasibility of the suggested approach.

The File Wrapper Anomaly Detector (FWRAP) has two parts, a sensor that audits file systems, and an unsupervised machine learning system that computes normal models of those accesses. FWRAP employs the Probabilistic Anomaly Detection (PAD) algorithm previously reported in our work on Windows Registry Anomaly Detection. FWRAP represents a general approach to anomaly detection. The detector is first trained by operating the host computer for some amount of time and a model specific to the target machine is automatically computed by PAD. The model is then deployed to a real-time detector. In this paper we describe the feature set used to model file system accesses, and the performance results of a set of experiments using the sensor while attacking a Linux host with a variety of malware exploits. The PAD detector achieved impressive detection rates in some cases over 95% and about a 2% false positive rate when alarming on anomalous processes.

Each GPCR consists of 7 transmembrane helices separated by alternating extracellular and intracellular loops. Viewing the helices and extracellular and intracellular loops as 3 different topics, the problem of segmenting the protein amino acid sequence according to its secondary structure is analogous to the problem of topic segmentation. The method presented involves building an n-gram language model for each 'topic' and comparing their performance in predicting the current amino acid, to determine whether a boundary occurs at the current position. This presents a distinctly different approach to protein segmentation from the Markov models that have been used previously and its commendable results is evidence of the benefit of applying machine learning and language technologies to bioinformatics.

One of the simplest clustering approaches is the iterative k-means algorithm. The quality of k-means clustering suffers from being confined to run with fixed k rather than being able to dynamically alter the value of k. Moreover, it would be much more elegant if the user did not have to supply the number of clusters for the algorithm. In this paper we consider recently proposed autonomous versions of the k-means algorithm. We demonstrate some of their shortcomings and put forward solutions for their deficiencies. In particular, we examine the problem of automatically determining a good initial candidate as the number of clusters.

Rather than downloading all accessible Web pages, a topical crawler analyzes the frontier of the crawled region to visit only the portion of the web that contains relevant web pages, and at the same time, try to skip irrelevant regions. This leads to significant savings in both computation and communication resources. In this paper, we present an integrated topical crawler: AuToCrawler The main features of AuToCrawler consist of a user interest specification module that mediates between users and search engines to identify target examples and keywords that together specify the topic of their interest, and a URL ordering strategy that combines features of several previous approaches and achieves significant improvement. It also provides a graphic user interface such that users can evaluate and visualize the crawling results that can be used as feedback to reconfigure the crawler.

While feature selection methods can often alleviate the problems associated with the curse of dimensionality, complex large scale pattern recognition problems may not be amenable to features selection approach due to large intrinsic dimensionality. In such situations, the only effective solution to conquer the complications of the high-dimensional functions is to incorporate knowledge about the data that is correct [4]. How to incorporate the domain knowledge with the specific machine learning system has been widely studied in the pattern classification field. In this paper, we will explore a novel method to synthesize a larger, valid training sample data set based on a smaller set of the key samples that are collected by a model based sampling theory that incorporates the domain knowledge of the computer vision. In addition to reducing the training sample size in the learning procedure, our emphasis is on providing practical advice on how to incorporate domain knowledge to design and simplify a vision based pattern classification model.

Identifying and classifying stakeholders helps the firm to analyze the environment it is facing and to make appropriate decisions. As traditional stakeholder analysis approaches can not accommodate the rapid Web growth, some researchers have applied machine learning methods such as neural networks and support vector machines to stakeholder ana lysis and gained desirable results. Support vector machines(SVMs) are new machine learning methods and have succeeded in many classification fields. Our theoretical analysis discovered that the two mostly used SVMs, C-SVM and v-SVM have different classification error rates on different classes if the sizes of training classes are uneven, If C-SVM or v-SVM is applied to stakeholder classification, we will get different error rates of different classed unless the count of training samples of different classes is same. In this paper, a weighted C-SVM is proposed and analyzed. It introduces a new parameter, class weights. Class weights can be used to emphasize the importance of each stakeholder class. The bigger the class weight is, the more important the class is. Experimental results showed that the weighted C-SVM was more effective than C-SVM in stakeholder classification.

Consequently, machine learning algorithms for automatically retrieving documents or recommending items may not achieve satisfactory levels of accuracy. However, if one views users as members of a larger user community, then it should be possible to leverage similarities between different users to overcome the sparseness problem. The paper proposes a collaborative machine learning framework to exploit inter-user similarities. More specifically, we present a kernel-based learning architecture that generalizes the well-known Support Vector Machine learning approach by enriching content descriptors with inter-user correlations.

Quantitative analysis of MCG ventricular repolarization (VR) parameters may be useful to detect myocardial ischemia in patients with apparently normal ECG. However, manual calculation of MCG VR is time consuming and can be dependent on the examiner's experience. Alternatively, the use of machine learning (ML) has been proposed recently to automate the interpretation of MCG recordings and to minimize human interference with the analysis. The aim of this study was to validate the predictive value of ML techniques in comparison with interactive, computer-aided, MCG analysis. ML testing was done on a set of 140 randomly analysed MCG recordings from 74 subjects: 41 patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) (group 1), 32 of them untreated (group 2), and 33 subjects without any evidence of cardiac disease (group 3). For each case at least 2 MCG datasets, recorded in different sessions, were analysed. Two ML techniques combined identified abnormal VR in 25 IHD patients (group 1) and excluded VR abnormalities in 28 controls (group 3) providing 75% sensitivity, 85% specificity, 83% positive predictive value, 78% negative predictive value, 80% predictive accuracy This result was for the most part in agreement, but statistically better than that obtained with interactive analysis. This study confirms that ML, applied on MCG recording at rest, has a predictive accuracy of 80% in detecting electrophysiological alterations associated with untreated IHD. Further work is needed to test the ML capability to differentiate VR alterations due to IHD from those due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathies.

In constructing the variety of logics presented in the paper, we make use of a certain kind of tolerance (similarity) relations called rough mereological tolerances. A Study of tolerance relations that arise in rough set environments was initiated in 1994, with the paper [23], in which basic ideas pertaining to tolerance relations in the rough set framework were pointed to. The analysis of the role tolerance relations may play in machine learning based on rough set-theoretic ideas was carried out by Professor Solomon Marcus in His seminal paper, written during His stay in Warsaw in December of the year 1994. At the same time the first author had first ideas related to the applicability of ideas of mereology in the rough set analysis Of uncertainty. In a later analysis it has turned out that mereological approach has led to a development of a new paradigm in reasoning under uncertainty, called rough mereology, proposed by Lech Polkowski and Andrzej Skowron. Within this paradigm, one is able to construct a variety of tolerance relations. Those tolerance relations, induced by rough mereological constructs called rough inclusions, serve as a basis for constructing a variety of logics, called rough mereological logics, that are related to the inherent structure of my rough set universe. In this paper, we introduce gradually all essential and necessary notions from the area of rough set theory, mereology and rough mereology, and then we discuss tolerance relations induced by tough inclusions alone with some methods for inducing rough inclusions with desired properties. The paper culminates with a discussion of intensional logics based on rough mereological tolerance relations. In this way, we explore one of so many paths in scientific research, that have been either pointed to or threaded by Professor Solomon Marcus.

J	Jensen, R; Shen, Q				Jensen, R; Shen, Q			Fuzzy-rough data reduction with ant colony optimization	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						data reduction; fuzzy-rough sets; ant colony optimization; feature selection	RULES; CATEGORIZATION; SYSTEM	Feature selection refers to the problem of selecting those input features that are most predictive of a given outcome; a problem encountered in many areas such as machine learning, pattern recognition and signal processing. In particular, solution to this has found successful application in tasks that involve datasets containing huge numbers of features (in the order of tens of thousands), which would be impossible to process further. Recent examples include text processing and web content classification. Rough set theory has been used as such a dataset preprocessor with much success, but current methods are inadequate at finding minimal reductions, the smallest sets of features possible. To alleviate this difficulty, a feature selection technique that employs a hybrid variant of rough sets, fuzzy-rough sets, has been developed recently and has been shown to be effective. However, this method is still not able to find the optimal subsets regularly. This paper proposes a new feature selection mechanism based on ant colony optimization in an attempt to combat this. The method is then applied to the problem of finding optimal feature subsets in the fuzzy-rough data reduction process. The present work is applied to complex systems monitoring and experimentally compared with the original fuzzy-rough method, an entropy-based feature selector, and a transformation-based reduction method, PCA. Comparisons with the use of a support vector classifier are also included. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper deals with the possible computer applications of the Sound Approach (c) English phonetic alphabet. The authors review some preliminary research into a few of the more promising approaches to the application of the processes of machine learning to this phonetic alphabet for computer spell-checking, computer speech recognition etc. Applying mathematical approaches to the development of a data-based phonetic spelling recognizer, and speech recognition technology used for language pronunciation training in which the speech recognizer allows a large margin of pronunciation accuracy, the authors delineate the parameters of the current research, and point the direction of both the continuation of the current project and future studies.

Recently applying artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining techniques to intrusion detection system are increasing. But most of researches are focused on improving the classification performance of classifier. Selecting important features from input data lead to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection rates. Thus selecting important features is an important issue in intrusion detection. Another issue in intrusion detection is that most of the intrusion detection systems axe performed by off-line and it is not proper method for realtime intrusion detection system. In this paper, we develop the realtime intrusion detection system which combining on-line feature extraction method with Least Squares Support Vector Machine classifier. Applying proposed system to KDD CUP 99 data, experimental results show that it have remarkable feature feature extraction and classification performance compared to existing off-line intrusion detection system.

The PPS can be thought of as a nonlinear probabilistic generalization of principal components, as it is designed to pass through the "middle" of the data. In fact, the PPS can map a manifold of any simple topology (as long as it can be described by a set of ordered vector co-ordinates) to data in high-dimensional space. In classification problems, each class of data is represented by a PPS manifold of varying complexity. Experiments using various PPS topologies from a 1-D line to 3-D spherical shell were conducted on two toy classification datasets and three UCI Machine Learning datasets. Classification results comparing the PPS to Gaussian Mixture Models and K-nearest neighbours show the PPS classifier to be promising, especially for high-D data.

Instead of calculating the stone potential in a hard crisp value, they usually state their estimation as this group being light or heavy and use that as a reason for their actions. This paper explains an approach using fuzzy reasoning to simulate a human players knowledge, which the system would be able to acquire and tune. In addition, fuzzy behaviour can be learned and would simulate characteristics which would be useful in a field of computer games.

Particle swarm optimization for analysis of mass spectral serum profiles	GECCO 2005: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, Vols 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference	JUN 25-29, 2005	Washington, DC	ACM SIGEVO		proteomics; support vector machines; swarm intelligence	ENHANCED LASER-DESORPTION; PROSTATE-CANCER; OVARIAN-CANCER; PROTEOMIC PATTERNS; SPECTROMETRY; IONIZATION; SAMPLES	Serum profiling using mass spectrometry is an emerging technology with a great potential to provide biomarkers for complex diseases such as cancer. However, protein profiles obtained from current mass spectrometric technologies are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex spectra with substantial level of noise. These characteristics have generated challenges in discovery of proteins and protein-profiles that distinguish cancer patients from healthy individuals. This paper proposes a novel machine learning method that combines support vector machines with particle swarm optimization for biomarker discovery. Prior to applying the proposed biomarker selection algorithm, low-level analysis methods are used for smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, and peak detection. The proposed method is applied for biomarker discovery from serum mass spectral profiles of liver cancer patients and controls.

Developing a way to solve this problem automatically would make current machine learning methods much more useful. Previous efforts to automate feature selection rely on expensive meta-learning or are applicable only when labeled training data is available. This paper presents a novel method called FS-NEAT which extends the NEAT neuroevolution method to automatically determine an appropriate set of inputs for the networks it evolves. By learning the network's inputs, topology, and weights simultaneously, FS-NEAT addresses the feature selection problem without relying on meta-learning or labeled data. Initial experiments in an autonomous car racing simulation demonstrate that FS-NEAT can learn better and faster than regular NEAT. In addition, the networks it evolves are smaller and require fewer inputs. Furthermore, FS-NEAT's performance remains robust even as the feature selection task it faces is made increasingly difficult.

Canary functions have been introduced in the literature as a concept for preventing overfitting by automatically recognizing when it starts to occur. This paper presents a simple scheme for implementing canary functions using cross-validation. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated by applying it to the numeric regression problem. A list of conditions and criteria for applying this technique to other problem domains is also identified. Other strategies for dealing with overfitting in GP are discussed.

This paper proposes a theoretical analysis of code bloat in the framework of symbolic regression in GP, from the viewpoint of Statistical Learning Theory, a well grounded mathematical toolbox for Machine Learning. Two kinds of bloat must be distinguished in that context, depending whether the target function lies in the search space or not. Then, important mathematical results are proved using classical results from Statistical Learning. Namely, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of programs is computed, and further results from Statistical Learning allow to prove that a parsimonious fitness ensures Universal Consistency (the solution minimizing the empirical error does converge to the best possible error when the number of examples goes to infinity). However, it is proved that the standard method consisting in choosing a maximal program size depending on the number of examples might still result in programs of infinitely increasing size with their accuracy; a more complicated modification of the fitness is proposed that theoretically avoids unnecessary bloat while nevertheless preserving the Universal Consistency.

It has a theoretical part where the covering pro ability of a random rule set is modelled and a practical part. The practical part has the objective of developing general initialization policies that have competent performance on a broad range of datasets. Two kinds of policies are! tested: (1) ways of tuning the initialization probability of the system and (2) smart initialization operators that create rules that are generalized versions of randomly sampled training instances. The results identify a subset of settings that are robust enough to be considered candidates to be the default initialization policy. These settings have competent performance compared to several alternative machine learning systems. Beside identifying the good policies, the experimentation made is also useful to give hints about what kind of initial solutions is the system able to process successfully to create well generalized solutions.

Experience from real-world data-mining has shown the need for such higher level rules. The game of Connect 4 is both multistep and complex, so standard Q-learning and Learning Classifier Systems perform poorly. The introduction of a novel Abstraction algorithm into an LCS is shown to improve performance in the evolution of playing strategies.

The policies are learned over an extensive generic image processing operator library. One of the principal weaknesses of the method lies with the large size of such libraries, which can make the machine learning process intractable. We demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to reduce the size of the operator library, thereby speeding up learning of the policy while still keeping human experts out of the development loop. Experiments in a challenging domain of forestry image interpretation exhibited a 95% reduction in the average time required to interpret an image, while maintaining the image interpretation accuracy of the full library.

Methods ranged from exploratory analyses, to machine learning strategies (neural networks, supervised learning, and tree-based methods), to false discovery rate control of type I errors. The general motivations were to find the "story" in the data and to summarize information from a multitude of measures. Several methods illustrated strategies for better trait definition, using summarization of related traits. In the few studies that sought to identify genes for alcoholism, there was little agreement among the different strategies, likely reflecting the complexities of the disease. Nevertheless, Group 14 found that these methods offered strategies to gain a better understanding of the complex pathways by which disease develops.

Excessive code growth or bloat often happens in GP, greatly slowing down the evolution process. In [Pol03], Poli proposed the Tarpeian Control method to reduce bloat, but possible side-effects of this method on the generalization accuracy of GP hypotheses remained to be tested. In particular, since Tarpeian Control puts a brake on code growth, it could behave as a kind of Occam's razor, promoting shorter hypotheses more able to extend their knowledge to cases apart from any learning steps. To answer this question, we experiment Tarpeian Control with symbolic regression. The results are contrasted, showing that it can either increase or reduce the generalization power of GP hypotheses, depending on the problem at hand. Experiments also confirm the decrease in size of programs. We conclude that Tarpeian Control might be useful if carefully tuned to the problem at hand.

In this context, a solution given by GP generally consists of a sole predictor. In contrast, Stack-based GP systems manipulate structures containing several predictors, which can be considered as teams of predictors. Work in Machine Learning reports that combining predictors gives good results in terms of both quality and robustness. In this paper, we use Stack-based GP to study different cooperations between predictors. First, preliminary tests and parameter tuning are performed on two GP benchmarks. Then, the system is applied to a real-world inverse problem. A comparative study with standard methods has shown limits and advantages of teams prediction, leading to encourage the use of combinations taking into account the response quality of each team member.

Histological diagnosis is challenging due to the poor or heterogenous differentiation of many tumors, resulting in uncertainty over prognosis and appropriate therapy. Results: We have undertaken a broad and comprehensive study of the gene expression profile of 96 tumors with representatives of all mesenchymal tissues, including several problem diagnostic groups. Using machine learning methods adapted to this problem we identify molecular fingerprints for most tumors, which are pathognomonic (decisive) and biologically revealing. Conclusion: We demonstrate the utility of gene expression profiles and machine learning for a complex clinical problem, and identify putative origins for certain mesenchymal tumors.

Using a classifier based on machine learning techniques to automatically filter out spam e-mail has drawn many researchers' attention. In this paper, we review some of relevant ideas and do a set of systematic experiments on e-mail categorization, which has been conducted with four machine learning algorithms applied to different parts of e-mail. Experimental results reveal that the header of e-mail provides very useful information for all the machine learning algorithms considered to detect spam e-mail.

Nevertheless, ILP systems are not robust enough to noisy or unseen data in real world domains. Furthermore, in multi-class problems, if the example is not matched with any learned rules, it cannot be classified This paper presents a novel hybrid learning method to alleviate this restriction by enabling Neural Networks to handle first-order logic programs directly. The proposed method, called First-Order Logical Neural Network (FOLNN), is based on feedforward neural networks and integrates inductive learning from examples and background knowledge. We also propose a method for determining the appropriate variable substitution in FOLNN learning by using Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL). In the experiments, the proposed method has been evaluated on two first-order learning problems, i.e., the Finite Element Mesh Design and Mutagenesis and compared with the state-of-the-art, the PROGOL system. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than PROGOL.

This paper presents a K ranked diagonal covariance-based missing value estimation algorithm (KRCOV) that has demonstrated significantly superior performance compared to the more commonly used K-nearest neighbour (KNN) imputation algorithm when it is applied to estimate missing values of BRCA1, BRCA2 and Sporadic genetic mutation samples present in ovarian cancer. Experimental results confirm KRCOV outperformed both KNN and zero imputation techniques in terms of their classification accuracies when used to impute randomly missing values from 1% to 5%. The classifier used for this purpose was the Generalized Regression Neural Network. The paper also provides a hypothesis for why KRCOV performs better than KNN not only for bioinformatics data but also for other data types having strong correlated values.

The objective is to both improve the performance of the MOEA and to reduce the number of evaluations needed when used for optimising the design of water distribution networks (where evaluations are highly computationally costly). We compare LEMMO with NSGA-II and conclude that our approach is very promising for improved speed and quality in the water systems optimisation domain.

Compared with the static momentum, the dynamic momentum is simultaneously obtained by the learning process of pattern weight and reflected into different momentum by the current state. Therefore, the proposed dynamic momentum algorithm can effectively control the convergence rate and performance. The experiment using SONAR data shows that the proposed algorithm has better convergence rate and performance than the kernel relaxation using static momentum.

It describes how the knowledge induced by a RuleNet neural network can be used as the initial knowledge for an NGE-like system to start learning. An NGE-based system can be considered an instance based learning method which allows generalization. The proposed collaboration between the two learning methods implemented by the hybrid system is feasible due to the similarity of the concept description languages employed by both. The paper also describes a few experiments conducted; results show that the RuleNet-NGE collaboration is plausible and, in some domains, it improves the performance of NGE on its own.

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for subcellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.

For complexity reasons, most stimuli generators use sequential solutions without planning ahead. Therefore, in many cases they fail to produce a consistent stimuli due to an inadequate selection of the initial state. We propose a new method, based on machine learning techniques, to improve generation success by learning the relationship between the initial state vector and generation success. We applied the proposed method in two different settings, with the objective of improving generation success and coverage in processor and system level generation. In both settings, the proposed method significantly reduced generation failures and enabled faster coverage.

In this article, we present a research work to enhance the load balancing, on dedicated and non-dedicated cluster configurations, based on a genetic machine learning algorithm. Our approach is characterized by an on time assignment scheme using a classifier system. Classifier systems are learning machine algorithms, based on high adaptable genetic algorithms. We developed a software package which was designed to test the proposed scheme in a master-slave Cow (Cluster of Workstation) and Now (Network of Workstation) environment. Experimental results, from two different operating systems, indicate the enhanced capability of our load balancing approach to adapt in cluster configurations.

These differences give rise to a problem of over-provisioning, that is, sub-optimal utilization of a cluster due to users requesting resource capacities greater than what their jobs actually need. Our analysis of a real workload file (LANL CM5) revealed differences of up to two orders of magnitude between requested memory capacity and actual memory usage. The problem of over-provisioning has received very little attention so far We discuss different approaches for applying machine learning methods to estimate the actual resource capacities used by jobs. These approaches are independent of the scheduling policies and the dynamic resource matching schemes used Our simulations show that these methods can yield an improvement of over 50% in utilization (throughput) of heterogeneous clusters.

However, there is a co-evolutionary arms race in progress and these proofs are becoming more difficult for genuine users while attackers are getting better at breaking existing HIPS. We studied various popular HIPS on the internet to understand their strength and human friendliness. To determine HIP strength, we adopted a direct approach of building computer attacks using image processing and machine learning techniques. To understand human-friendliness, a sequence of users studies were conducted to investigate HIP character recognition by humans under a variety of visual distortions and clutter commonly employed in reading-based HIPS. We found that many of the online HIPS are pure recognition tasks that can be easily broken using machine learning. The stronger HIPS tend to pose a combination of segmentation and recognition challenges. Further, the HIP user studies show that given correct segmentation, computers are much better at HIP character recognition than humans. In light of these results, we propose that segmentation-based reading challenges are the future for building stronger human-friendly HIPS. An example of such a segmentation-based HIP is presented with a preliminary assessment of its strength and human-friendliness.

This development raises the possibility of reconfiguring distributed systems online to optimize for dynamically changing workloads. This paper presents the initial steps towards a system that can learn to alter its current configuration in reaction to the current workload. In particular the advantages of shifting CPU and memory resources online are considered. Investigation on a publically available multi-machine, multi-process distributed system (the online transaction processing benchmark TPC-W) indicates that there is a real performance benefit to reconfiguration in reaction to workload changes. A learning framework is presented that does not require any instrumentation of the middleware, nor any special instrumentation of the operating system; rather, it learns to identify preferable configurations as well as their quantitative performance effects from system behavior as reported by standard monitoring tools. Initial results using the WEKA machine learning package suggest that automatic adaptive configuration can provide measurable performance benefits over any fixed configuration.

PICCIL uses keywords and keyword rules both to preclassify documents and to assist in the manual process of grouping and reviewing documents. The reviewed documents, in turn, are used to refine the keyword rules iteratively to improve subsequent grouping and document review. We apply PICCIL to the problem of assigning semantic situation labels to the entries of a catalog of log events to support on-line labeling of log events.

It presents two complementary rule analysis methods that discover when a rule was learned from incomplete explanations of an example, guiding the expert to provide additional explanations. One method performs a structural analysis of the learned rule, while the other method analyles the possible rule instantiations. Both methods have been implemented in the Disciple-RKF learning agent and have been tested both in an automatic framework and during two knowledge acquisition experiments performed with subject matter experts at the US Army War College.

However, a massive amount of spam mail is polluting mailboxes everyday, taking advantage of the ability to send mail to any number of random people through the internet. In this paper we will introduce an efficient method of classifying E-mails using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) learning algorithm, which is recently showing high performance in the field of classifying documents. The disposition of the words inside the E-mail documents are extracted, and the performance of classification is compared and examined through the learning based on the change of DF value which occurs to reduce the disposition space in the learning level. To assess the performance of the SVM, the SVM is compared to the Naive Bayes classifier (which uses probability methods) and a vector model classifier in order to verify that the method of using the learning algorithm of SVM shows better performance.

Broadcasting functions as a foundation of MANET communication. Unicast, multicast, and geocast protocols utilize broadcasting as a building block, providing important control and route establishment functionality. Therefore, any improvements to the process of broadcasting can be immediately realized by MANET applications. While efficient broadcast protocols have been proposed, no single broadcasting protocol works well in all possible MANET conditions. Furthermore, every protocol fails catastrophically in severe network environments. We exhibit a new approach to the design of a broadcast protocol: the decision of whether to rebroadcast a packet is cast as a classification problem. Each mobile node (MN) builds a classifier and trains it on data collected from the network environment. Given an input vector describing a broadcast packet and current network conditions, the classifier returns an output label of "Rebroadcast" or "Drop:" Because each MN adapts to changing network conditions, the result is a more robust communication protocol and more efficient use of network resources. We show that our protocol, compared to those tested, is the most efficient under a range of network conditions.

In spite of all knowledge-based technologies, which have been proposed recently, the main driving power of "intelligent" approaches is still (and even increasingly) huge computational power of modern information technology, that is used to process vast amounts of data. Two main technologies of intelligent systems in medicine, both based on data processing and search, are thus optimization and machine learning. They are used for different kinds of medical problems: data mining, diagnosing, medical imaging and signal processing, planning and scheduling, etc. In the paper we summarize some of the most evident applications of this kind.

An interactive classification method using the granule network is proposed, which allows multi-strategies for granule tree construction and enhances the understanding and interpretation of the classification process. This method is complementary to the existing classification methods.

However, finding the biological meaning of the clusters is still a manual work, which becomes very difficult as the amount of data grows. In this paper, the authors present a few experiments applying Text Mining and Machine Learning techniques to help associating meaning to genes clusters. These experiments were applied to papers abstracts and interaction database data related to Saccaromyces cerevisiae genes both for identifying texts content and for explaining the biological meaning of the genes clusters found. The results were compared to information published by experts in molecular biology and a number of relevant equivalences were found.

One of the most successful ensemble creation algorithms is the random subspace method. But it can not ensure the accuracy of each base classifier. A genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection strategy is used to generate the base support vector machines (SVMs) classifiers of the ensemble. And a weighted/random voting scheme is proposed to integrate the individual classifications of the base classifiers into one final classification. Experiments on two datasets of UCI machine learning repository confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

The core problem of soft-sensor is to construct appropriate mathematic model. Support vector machines (SVM) is a novel machine learning method based on structure risk minimizing principle, which is powerful for the problem characterized by small sample, nonlinearity, high dimension and local minima, and has high generalization. In this paper, soft-sensor modeling method and algorithm based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed, and cross validation method is used to select hyper-parameters of SVM model. Soft-sensor model based on SVM is applied to estimation nonlinear time-vary system. Experiment results show that SVM provides a new effective method for soft-sensor modeling and has promising application in industrial process applications.

If arcs of a graphical model are all directed both within and between time-slice, the model is called dynamic Bayesian network (D13N). Dynamic Bayesian networks are becoming increasingly important for research and applications in the area of machine learning, artificial intelligence and signal processing. It has several advantages over other data analysis methods including rule bases, neural network, decision trees, etc. In this paper, there explored dynamic Bayesian learning over DBNs by a new deterministic approximate inference method called Expectation Propagation (EP). EP is an extension of belief propagation and is developed in machine learning. A crucial step of EP is the likelihoods recycling, which makes possible further improvement over the extended Kalman smoother. This study examined EP solutions to a non-linear state-space model and compared its performance with other inference methods such as particle filter, extended Kalman filter, etc.	Univ Texas, Dept Elect Engn, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA	Tao, W (reprint author), Univ Texas, Dept Elect Engn, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.

With this data we train a machine learning model which mimics the expert's behaviour. This is just a simple application of a modelling technique known as ''mimetism", which has many other applications. This "soft" approach to knowledge acquisition has many advantages: any machine learning technique can be used, the expert must only answer simple questions (cases) and we can combine the decisions of several experts easily. However, one Problem of this approach is that we do not know in advance how many cases we will need to ask in order to get a good model which is accurate wrt. the expert's knowledge. Obviously, as more data is labelled by the expert better results are obtained. However, asking thousands of cases to the expert is usually impractical. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of knowledge acquisition through mimetic learning according to two factors: accuracy and comprehensibility of the resulting model and we devise a method to compute the minimum number of cases that we need to ask the expert to attain a certain quality level.

It provides an opportunity to address high risk components earlier in the development life cycle, when their impact Is minimized. This research proposes a model that captures the evolution of the quality of a software product, and provides reliable forecasts of the end quality of the software being developed in terms of product suitability. Development team skill, software process maturity, and software problem complexity are hypothesized as driving factors of software product quality. The cause-effect relationships between these factors and the elements of software suitability are modeled using Bayesian Belief Networks, a machine learning method. This research presents a Bayesian Network for software quality, and the techniques used to quantify the factors that influence and represent software quality. The developed model is found to be effective in predicting the end product quality of small-scale software development efforts.

In brain slices of neuronal tissue, it has become possible to both measure electro-physiological properties of a given neuron and to extract a sample of its cytoplasm so that expressed genes can be amplified. Thus, the presence or absence of genes related to ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane can be correlated with neuronal behavior encoded as a set of electro-physiological parameters. A typical gene amplification process is asymmetric in the sense that false positives are very rare, whereas false negatives (genes expressed but not amplified) are rather common. An analysis of a probabilistic model of that process yields a similarity measure between two strings of amplified genes that takes the asymmetry of the amplification process into account. This similarity measure can be put under the form of a conformal-transformed kernel. We provide experiments with support-vector machines on artificial and neuronal data.

A QSAR generalizes how the structure of a compound relates to its biological activity. There is growing interest in the application of machine learning techniques in QSAR modeling research. However, no single technique can claim to be uniformly superior to any other. This study introduced the ensemble machine learning, a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are combined in some way (typically by weighted or unweighted voting) to improve the performance of the overall system. A comparative study was carried out of two popular ensemble learning algorithms, Bagging and AdaBoost, for QSAR modeling. Two test case problems were studied: the inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by pyrimidines, and the inhibition of rat/mouse tumor DHFR by triazines. It was observed that the ensemble learning algorithms, Bagging and AdaBoost, can significantly improve the performance of Decision Tree C4.5 and 1-R (p < 0.05), while Naive Bayesian and 1-Nearest Neighbor did not benefit from ensemble learning. Furthermore, in general, AdaBoost outperformed Bagging on the tested data sets.

Risk factor identification may allow for future ED prevention or delay onset. The goal of this investigation is, 1) to evaluate different machine learning approaches for prognosticating ED and, 2) to analyze the degree of importance of ED risk factors. The investigated machine learning approaches include: 1) logistic regression as a statistical method, 2) multilayer feedforward backpropagation neural networks (an artificial neural-network tool), 3) the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor classifier as a fuzzy logic method; 4) support vector machine (SVM), a relatively new machine learning process, and 5) conventional discriminant function analysis. The overall results obtained indicate that the artificial neural network method yields the highest ROC-AUC, and that it has produced the most reliable model for prognosticating ED when compared to the other investigated models.

The wealth of traditional single-relational machine learning tools, on the other hand, calls for methods of 'propositionalization', ie. conversion of multi-relational data into single-relational representations. A major stream of propositionalization algorithms is based on the construction of truth-valued features (first-order logic atom conjunctions), which capture relational properties of data and play the role of binary attributes in the resulting single-table representation. Such algorithms typically use backtrack depth first search for the syntactic construction of features complying to user's mode/type declarations. As such they incur a complexity factor exponential in the maximum allowed feature size. Here we present a polynomial-runtime alternative based on an efficient reduction between the feature construction problem on the propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem, such that the latter involves only Horn clauses and is therefore efficiently solvable.

The bound on the generalization error that is output by our algorithm is based on Rademacher Penalization, a data driven penalization technique. We prove probabilistic oracle inequalities for the theoretical risk of the estimators based on this approach. This is done by comparing the performance of an idealized genetic algorithm that uses a fitness function based on the generalization error with that of an empirical genetic algorithm based on Rademacher penalization. The, inequalities indicate that although we are not able to implement the idealized algorithm (because of the inability to compute the generalization error), the empirical algorithm does almost as well as the idealized algorithm would.

Thus their correct application in a system's design may significantly improve its internal quality attributes such as reusability and maintainability. In software maintenance the existence of up-to-date documentation is crucial, so the discovery of as yet unknown design pattern instances can help improve the documentation. Hence a reliable design pattern recognition system is very desirable. However simpler methods (based on pattern matching) may give imprecise results due to the vague nature of the patterns' structural description. In previous work we presented a pattern matching-based system using the Columbus framework with which we were able to find pattern instances from the source code by considering the patterns' structural descriptions only, and therefore we could not identify false hits and distinguish similar design patterns such as State and Strategy. In the present work we use machine learning to enhance pattern mining by filtering out as many false hits as possible. To do so we distinguish true and false pattern instances with the help of a learning database created by manually tagging a large C++ system.

Instead of only computing with the known part of the constraint, we propose to complete its definition by using Machine Learning techniques. Since constraints are actively used during solving for pruning domains, building a classifier for instances is not enough: we need a solver able to reduce variable domains. Our technique is composed of two steps: first we learn a classifier for the constraint's projections and then we transform the classifier into a propagator We show that our technique not only has good learning performances but also yields a very efficient solver for the learned constraint.

An item bank is a collection of textual data in which each item consists Of short sentences and has only a few relevant words for categorization; some items could be categorized into many categories. The traditional categorization techniques cannot provide sufficiently accurate results because of a "lack of words" problem. From this observation, items in the same category always have the same group of terms (or keywords) and the similar locations of these terms in phrases suggest that the items have a high probability to be in the same category. Our new methodology PKIP, patterned keywords in phrase, is proposed to improve categorization accuracy and recover from the "lack of words "problem. The k-highest weight order words are selected as the keywords from each category and their patterns are mapped for feature selection. The value of k affects the classification result. The item bank categorization process is based on a supervised machine learning technique. The sample of the item bank that is used in this research is the collection of Thai primary mathematics problems item bank and we use SVM in the Weka machine learning software package as our classifier. The result of the classification shows that our approach produces acceptable classification results and the highest classification result is given when k = 12.

The system consists of a digital camera and a standard note book personal computer (PC). We estimate the degree of accuracy of the judgment of various pattern classification methods without special image processing techniques such as the extraction of features. The results show that a support vector machine is the most suitable instrument for this judgment system. We obtain the high degree of accuracy by compressing the image data in order to decrease the number of features.

Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is an SVM version which involves equality instead of inequality constraints and works with a least squares cost function. This paper discusses least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) estimation algorithm and introduces applications of the novel method for the nonlinear control systems. Then identification of MIMO models and soft-sensor modeling based on least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides a powerful tool for identification and soft-sensor modeling and has promising application in industrial process applications.

The self-organizing map has shown to he one of the most useful clustering algorithms. However, its applicability, is limited by the fact that some knowledge about the data is required prior to clustering. In this paper we introduce a novel model of SOM, called growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) to cluster gene expression data. The training and growth process of the GHSOM is entirely data driven, requiring no prior knowledge or estimates for parameter specification, thus helps to find not only the appropriate number of clusters but also the hierarchical relations in the data set. To validate our results, we employed a novel validation technique, which is known as figure of merit (FOM).

This paper presents a new method for automatically retrieving functional requirements from the stakeholders using agile processes. The presented system is a machine learning system for the automation of some aspects of the software requirements phase in the software engineering process. This learning system encompasses knowledge acquisition and belief revision in a knowledge base. It is based on Tecuci's multi-strategy task-adaptive learning by justification trees algorithm, known as Disciple-MTL, and supports a few of the practices that Extreme Programming (XP) requires. The aim of the algorithm is to collect information from the various stakeholders and integrate a variety of learning methods in the knowledge acquisition process, while involving certain and plausible reasoning. The result of the manipulation is a list of requirements essential to a software system.

J	Oyang, YJ; Hwang, SC; Ou, YY; Chen, CY; Chen, ZW				Oyang, YJ; Hwang, SC; Ou, YY; Chen, CY; Chen, ZW			Data classification with radial basis function networks based on a novel kernel density estimation algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						data classification; kernel density estimation; machine learning; neural network; radial basis function (RBF) network	SVM HYPERPARAMETERS	This paper presents a novel learning algorithm for efficient construction of the radial basis function (RBF) networks that can deliver the same level of accuracy as the support vector machines (SVMs) in data classification applications. The proposed learning algorithm works by constructing one RBF subnetwork to approximate the probability density function of each class of objects in the training data set. With respect to algorithm design, the main distinction of the proposed learning algorithm is the novel kernel density estimation algorithm that features an average time complexity of O (n log n), where n is the number of samples in the training data set. One important advantage of the proposed learning algorithm, in comparison with the SVM, is that the proposed learning algorithm generally takes far less time to construct a data classifier with an optimized parameter setting. This feature is of significance for many contemporary applications, in particular, for those applications in which new objects are continuously added into an already large database. Another desirable feature of the proposed learning algorithm is that the RBF networks constructed are capable of carrying out data classification with more than two classes of objects in one single run. In other words, unlike with the SVM, there is no need to resort to mechanisms such as one-against-one or one-against-all for handling datasets with more than two classes of objects. The comparison with SVM is of particular interest, because it has been shown in a number of recent studies that SVM generally are able to deliver higher classification accuracy than the other existing data classification algorithms. As the proposed learning algorithm is instance-based, the data reduction issue is also addressed in this paper. One interesting observation in this regard is that, for all three data sets used in data reduction experiments, the number of training samples remaining after a naive data reduction mechanism is applied is quite close to the number of support vectors identified by the SVM software. This paper also compares the performance of the RBF networks constructed with the proposed learning algorithm and those constructed with a conventional cluster-based learning algorithm. The most interesting observation learned is that, with respect to data classification, the distributions of training samples near the boundaries between different classes of objects carry more crucial information than the distributions of samples in the inner parts of the clusters.

Single-purpose hardware can achieve the highest performance and uniprocessors can be the most programmable. Between these extremes, programmable and reconfigurable architectures provide a wide range of choice in flexibility, programmability, computational density, and performance. The UCSC Kestrel parallel processor strives to attain single-purpose performance while maintaining user programmability. Kestrel is a single-instruction stream, multiple-data stream (SIMD) parallel processor with a 512-element linear array of 8-bit processing elements. The system design focuses on efficient high-throughput DNA and protein sequence analysis, but its programmability enables high performance on computational chemistry, image processing, machine learning, and other applications. The Kestrel system has had unexpected longevity in its utility due to a careful design and analysis process. Experience with the system leads to the conclusion that programmable SIMD architectures can excel in both programmability and performance. This paper presents the architecture, implementation, applications, and observations of the Kestrel project at the University of California at Santa Cruz.

As a powerful learning tool, increasingly neural networks have been adopted by many large-scale information processing applications but there is no a set of well defined criteria for choosing a neural network. The user mostly treats a neural network as a black box and cannot explain how learning from input data was done nor how performance can be consistently ensured. We have experimented with several information visualization designs aiming to open the black box to possibly uncover underlying dependencies between the input data and the output data of a neural network. In this paper, we present our designs and show that the visualizations not only help us design more efficient neural networks, but also assist us in the process of using neural networks for problem solving such as performing a classification task.

On the basis of the analysis of TSVMs recently introduced in the machine learning literature and of the properties of hyperspectral classification problems, a specific TSVM algorithm is proposed to alleviate the Hughes phenomenon in a nonparametric and kernel-based classification framework. The extension of the proposed technique to multiclass cases is also discussed. Experimental results obtained on a real hyperspectral image point out that when small-size training data are available, the proposed TSVMs outperform standard Inductive Support Vector Machines (ISVMs).

Inland fresh water lake wetland plays in important role in the regional ecological balance. Hongze Lake is the fourth fresh water lake in China. Regrettable, in recent years, the wetland of the lake, which has already been under natural stresses because of the decrease of water supplement, has been in degradation with time because of the reclamation for crab culture since the late 1980s. Remote sensing, a cost effective monitoring tool for environmental change, has already been used in the research of wetland in many parts of the world including investigation of wetland in China. In the paper, the machine learning rules inferring methodology was used in the identification of wetland types of Hongze Lake. The object of the paper was to identify the different types of wetland for the later change analysis in one environmental monitoring project. This result of project will provide the decision-makers a basis for wetland protection and restoration of Hongze Lake. Compared with traditional classification methods, the rule-based inferring method has improved the accuracy of identification by 13.81%. In the identification of wetland by using the machine learning technique, not only the spectral information of geo-objects was used, but also other information on wetland such as texture, location, context and shape were also used. The data from different aspects were integrated and applied to the identification in con junction with machine learning rules. It has been proven that the machine learning rules inferring technique worked well in the integration of multi source data and could significantly improve the accuracy of identification of wetland.

The datasets are increasing in both rows (i.e., records) and columns (i.e., variables). One critical item that impacts the performance of these algorithms is the approach taken for storing and processing the data elements. This paper examines the performance tradeoffs between row major order and column major order in the context of heuristic variable selection for the case when variable selection is frequently used in some applications. The column major order approach is empirically shown to provide better runtime performance than the row major order.

The model inherits most of the characteristics of the basic model of rough set; and they also have a better effect of approximation classification.

One of the techniques for achieving this goal is to construct decision tables. Decision tables can be constructed based on implicit relationship amongst data fields and they are either deterministic or non-deterministic. In case of non-deterministic decision tables, it is not always possible to find a decision rule. However in these situations, one can employ the techniques of rough sets to make a rough decision table, by which at least one can discern situations in which it is possible to make a decision from those which is not. The probabilistic decision table is a generalization of non-deterministic decision table in which we not only consider the partial functional dependencies but also the statistical dependencies. It is shown in this paper, how one can use fuzzy sets to capture statistical dependencies among the data to make a so called fuzzy decision table.

A variety of learning techniques proposed for different intrusion detection problems can be roughly classified into two broad categories: supervised (classification) and unsupervised (anomaly detection and clustering). In this contribution we develop an experimental framework for comparative analysis of both kinds of learning techniques. In our framework we cast unsupervised techniques into a special case of classification, for which training and model selection can be performed by means of ROC analysis. We then investigate both kinds of learning techniques with respect to their detection accuracy and ability to detect unknown attacks.

Given a machine segmentation and a CT reference, performance measures are needed. We propose to consider the image segmentation problem as one of data clustering and, as a consequence, to use measures for comparing clusterings developed in statistics and machine learning. By doing so, we obtain a variety of performance measures which have not been used before in computer vision. In particular, some of these measures have the highly desired property of being a metric. Experimental results are reported on both synthetic and real data to validate the measures and compare them with others.

This system integrates the MIL-based and global-feature-based SVMs for categorization. The IN (Instance Prototypes) are derived from the segmented regions by applying MIL on the training images from different categories. The IPs-based image features are further used as inputs to a set of SVMs to find the optimum hyperplanes for categorizing training images. Similarly, global image features, including color histogram and edge histogram, are fed into another set of SVMs. For each test image, two sets of image features are constructed and sent to the two respective sets of SVMs. The decision values from two sets of SVMs are finally incorporated to obtain the final categorization results. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the peer systems in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

A classifier (e.g. neural network or adaboost trained classifier) within the detector selects a relevant subset of extremal regions, i.e. regions that are connected components of a thresholded image. Properties of extremal regions render the detector very robust to illumination change. Robustness to viewpoint change is achieved by using invariant descriptors and/or by modeling shape variations by the classifier. The approach is brought to bear on three problems: text detection, face segmentation and leopard skin detection. High detection rates were obtained for unconstrained (i.e. brightness, affine and font invariant) text detection (92%) with a reasonable false positive rate. The time-complexity of the detection is approximately linear in the number of pixels and a non-optimized implementation runs at about 1 frame per second for a 640 x 480 image on a high-end PC.

The focus of this paper is to detect sequences of dialogue, rather than complete scenes. We argue that these shorter sequences are more desirable as retrieval units than temporally long scenes. This paper combines various audiovisual features that reflect accepted and well know film making conventions using a selection of machine learning techniques in order to detect such sequences. Three systems for detecting dialogue sequences are proposed: one based primarily on audio analysis, one based primarily on visual analysis and one that combines the results of both. The performance of the three systems are compared using a manually marked-up test corpus drawn from a variety of movies of different genres. Results show that high precision and recall can be obtained using low-level features that are automatically extracted.

For example, the patent office uses the similarity of shape to ensure that there are no infringements of copyrighted trademarks. This paper focuses on using machine learning and information retrieval techniques to classify an image into one of many classes based on shape. In particular, we compare Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and relevance language models for classification. Our results indicate that, on the MPEG-7 database, the relevance model outperforms the machine learning techniques and is competitive with prior work on shape based retrieval. We also show how the relevance model approach may be used to perform shape retrieval using keywords.

Recently, this questions has received a lot of attention. Several statistical relational learning approaches have been developed in related, but different areas including machine learning, statistics, databases, and reasoning under uncertainty. This thesis starts from an inductive logic programming perspective and firstly develops a general framework for statistical relational learning: probabilistic inductive logic programming. Based on this foundation, the thesis shows how to incorporate the logical concepts of objects and relations among these objects into Bayesian networks. As time and actions are not just other relations, it afterwards develops approaches to probabilistic inductive logic programming over time and for making complex decision in relational domains. More specifically, Bayesian networks are upgraded to Bayesian logic programs, hidden Markov models to logical hidden Markov models; and Markov decision processes to Markov decision programs. Furthermore, it will be shown that statistical relational learning approaches naturally yield kernels for structured data. The resulting approaches will be illustrated using examples from genetics, bio-informatics, and classical planning domains.

The explanation given is usually based on expressions such as "because case a is similar to case V. However, a more general or meaningful pattern, such as "because case a has properties x and y (as b has)" is usually more difficult to find. Even in this case, the connection of this pattern with the original distance-based method is generally unclear, or even inconsistent. In this paper, we study the connection between the concept of distance (or similarity) and the concept of generalisation. More precisely, we define several conditions which, in our view, a sensible distance-based generalisation must have. From that, we are able to tell whether a generalisation operator for a pattern representation language is consistent with the metric space defined by the underlying distance. We show that there are pattern languages and generalisation operators which comply with these properties for typical data types: nominal, numerical, sets and lists. We also show the relationship between the well-known concepts of Igg and distances between terms, and the definition of generalisation presented in this paper.

A step forward concerned the integration of multiple inference strategies within a first-order logic learning framework, taking advantage of the benefits that each approach can bring. Specifically, abduction is exploited to complete the incoming information in order to handle cases of missing knowledge, and abstraction is exploited to eliminate superfluous details that can affect the performance of a learning system. However, these methods require some background information to exploit the specific inference strategy, that must be provided by a domain expert. This work proposes algorithms to automatically discover such an information in order to make the learning task completely autonomous. The proposed methods have been tested on the system INTHELEX, and their effectiveness has been proven by experiments in a real-world domain.

Their performance degrades only logarithmically with the input dimension, making them useful in large spaces such as relational theories. However, online first-order learners are intrinsically limited by a computational barrier: even in the finite, function-free case, the number of possible features grows exponentially with the number of first-order atoms generated from the vocabulary. To circumvent this issue, we exploit the paradigm of closure-based learning which allows the learner to focus on the features that lie in the closure space generated from the examples which have lead to a mistake. Based on this idea, we develop an online algorithm for learning theories formed by disjunctions of existentially quantified conjunctions of atoms. In this setting, we show that the number of mistakes depends only logarithmically on the number of features. Furthermore, the computational cost is essentially bounded by the size of the closure lattice.

Several distinct, and complementary modelling techniques are being explored. Firstly, work is being conducted on applying Support-Vector ILP (SVILP) as an accurate means of screening high-toxicity molecules. Secondly, Bayes' networks have been machine-learned to provide causal maps of the effects of toxins on the network of metabolic reactions within cells. The data were derived from a study on the effects of hydrazine toxicity in rats. Although the resultant network can be partly explained in terms of existing KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway descriptions, several of the strong dependencies in the Bayes' network involve metabolite pairs with high separation in KEGG. Thirdly, in a complementary study KEGG pathways are being used as background knowledge for explaining the same data using a model constructed using Abductive ILP, a logic-based machine learning technique. With a binary prediction model (up/down regulation) cross validation results show that even with a restricted number of observed metabolites high predictive accuracy (80-90%) is achieved on unseen metabolite concentrations. Further increases in accuracy are achieved by allowing discovery of general rules from additional literature data on hydrazine inhibition. Ongoing work is aimed at formulating probabilistic logic models which combine the learned Bayes' network and ILP models.

J	Garliauskas, A				Garliauskas, A			An influence of nonlinearities to storage capacity of neural networks	INFORMATICA			English	Article						mean field theory; storage capacity; nonlinearity; neural networks	ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY; MODELS; SYNAPSES	The more realistic neural soma and synaptic nonlinear relations and an alternative mean field theory (MFT) approach relevant for strongly interconnected systems as a cortical matter are considered. The general procedure of averaging the quenched random states in the fully-connected networks for MFT, as usually, is based on the Boltzmann Machine learning. But this approach requires an unrealistically large number of samples to provide a reliable performance. We suppose an alternative MFr with deterministic features instead of stochastic nature of searching a solution a set of large number equations. Of course, this alternative theory will not be strictly valid for infinite number of elements. Another property of generalization is an inclusion of the additional member in the effective Hamiltonian allowing to improve the stochastic hill-climbing search of the solution not dropping into local minima of the energy function. Especially, we pay attention to increasing of neural networks retrieval capability transforming the replica-symmetry model by including of different nonlinear elements.

J	Fu, YG; Shen, RM; Shen, LP; Lei, XS				Fu, YG; Shen, RM; Shen, LP; Lei, XS			Reliable information hiding based on support vector machine	INFORMATICA			English	Article						information hiding; support vector machine; digital watermarking; BCH coding	ROBUST IMAGE WATERMARKING; DIGITAL WATERMARKING; COLOR IMAGES; DOMAIN; MULTIMEDIA	In this paper, a reliable information hiding scheme based on support vector machine and error correcting codes is proposed. To extract the hidden information bits from a possibly tampered watermarked image with a lower error probability, information hiding is modeled as a digital communication problem, and both the good generalization ability of support vector machine and the error correction code BCH are applied. Due to the good learning ability of support vector machine, it can learn the relationship between the hidden information and corresponding watermarked image; when the water-marked image is attacked by some intentional or unintentional attacks, the trained support vector machine can recover the right hidden information bits. The reliability of the proposed scheme has been tested under different attacks. The experimental results show that the embedded information bits are perceptually transparent and can successfully resist common image processing, jitter attack, and geometrical distortions. When the host image is heavily distorted, the hidden information can also be extracted recognizably, while most of existing methods are defeated. We expect this approach provide an alternative way for reliable information hiding by applying machine learning technologies.

For example, an image element can be part of the main content, advertisement, or banner of the site. This paper describes ongoing work using a machine learning approach to classify each element in a web page into six functional categories: Content (C), Related Link (R), Navigation (N), Advertisement (A), Form (F) and Other (O). This allows the extraction of only certain categories of content in a webpage to be delivered to a mobile device to fit user's specific needs, or to facilitate web information processes like web mining or mobile search. We manually labeled 18,864 elements from 150 websites. For each element we extracted both local features (such as the text length, URL, tag name etc) and global features (such as the text match with the other elements) to construct a feature vector. We trained the training set 10,650 elements with a decision tree learning algorithm J48, and it achieved 82% accuracy for stratified cross-validation, and an average F value 0.78 for the six different categories. Testing on 3,043 elements from pages that are not included in the training set gives 58% accuracy rate. Although this is not satisfactory overall, the F value for content category reaches 0.795, indicating that the method could be useful for less demanding applications. We are working on improving the results in order to make automatic functional classification of web elements feasible and to provide new opportunities to push the state of art in the mobile internet and mobile search.

A range of methods have been proposed in the research literature, using a variety of features and machine learning approaches, but the methods have been tested on very different data and the results cannot be compared. It is not even clear whether the differences in performance are due to feature selection or other variables. In this paper we examine the use of a large publicly available collection of newswire articles as a benchmark for comparing authorship attribution methods. To demonstrate the value of having a benchmark, we experimentally compare several recent feature-based techniques for authorship attribution, and test how well these methods perform as the volume of data is increased. We show that the benchmark is able to clearly distinguish between different approaches, and that the scalability of the best methods based on using function words features is acceptable, with only moderate decline as the difficulty of the problem is increased.

Although the main component of structured data plays an important role when designing classifiers, additional components may contain beneficial information for classification. This paper focuses on a probabilistic classifier design for multiclass classification based on the combination of main and additional components. Our formulation separately considers component generative models and constructs the classifier by combining these trained models based on the maximum entropy principle. We use naive Bayes models as the component generative models for text and link components so that we can apply our classifier design to document and web page classification problems. Our experimental results for three test collections confirmed that the proposed method effectively combined the main and additional components to improve classification performance.

The system analyses Hartmann-Shack images from human eyes in order to identify refractive errors, wich are associated to myopia, hypermetropia and astigmatism. The ensemble is composed by three different Machine Learning techniques: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and C4.5 algorithm and has been shown to be able to improve the performance achieved). The most relevant data of these images are extracted using Gabor wavelets transform. Machine learning techniques are then employed to carry out the image analysis.

In multiclass applications, many works divide the whole problem in multiple binary subtasks, whose results are then combined. This paper introduces a new framework for multiclass Support Vector Machines generation from binary predictors.

Contrary to several information extraction systems based on some machine learning techniques that need some linguistic parsing of the documents, we propose an hybrid approach based on association rules mining and decision tree learning that does not require any linguistic processing. The system may be parameterized in various ways that influence the efficiency of the information extraction rules we discovered. The experiments show the system does not need a large training set to perform well.

In this paper we present a new approach to preference elicitation based on pairwise comparison. The exploitation of learning techniques allows to overcome the usual restrictions that prevent to scale up. Furthermore, we show how our approach can easily support a distributed process of preference elicitation combining both autonomy and coordination among different stakeholders. We argue that a collaborative approach to preference elicitation can be effective in dealing with non homogeneous data representations. The presentation of the model is followed by an empirical evaluation on a real world settings. We consider a case study on environmental risk assessment to test with real users the properties of our model.

Existing approaches for defining the domain knowledge are categorized into white-box and black-box approaches, each of which has limitations. White-box approaches define detailed formulas for system behavior, and are limited by excessive complexity and brittleness of the information. On the other hand, black-box techniques gather domain knowledge by monitoring the system; they are error-prone and require an infeasible number of iterations to converge in real-world systems. MONITORMINING is a gray-box approach for creating domain knowledge in automated system management; it combines simple designer-defined specifications with the information gathered using machine learning. The designer specifications enumerate input parameters for the system behavior functions, while regression techniques (such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines) are used to derive the mathematical function that relates these parameters. These functions are constantly refined at run-time, by periodically invoking regression on the newly monitored data. MONITORMINING has the advantage of reduced complexity of the designer specifications, better accuracy of regression functions due to a reduced parameter set, and self-evolving with the changes in the system. Our initial experimental results of applying MONITORMINING are quite promising.

Of the three sources, two of the traffic sources were synthetic, which means the traffic was generated in a controlled environment for intrusion detection benchmarking. The main objective of the analysis is to determine the differences between synthetic and real-world traffic, however the analysis methodology detailed in this paper can be employed for general network analysis purposes. Moreover the framework, which we employed to generate one of the two synthetic traffic sources, is briefly discussed.

Improved computational algorithms based on the computational invariant theory of finite groups in Euclidean space and a demo application is presented. Progressive model automatic generation is discussed. GEOGINE (c) can be used as an efficient computational kernel for fast reliable application development and delivery in advanced biomedical engineering, biometric, intelligent computing, target recognition, content image retrieval, data mining technological areas mainly. Ontology can be regarded as a logical theory accounting for the intended meaning of a formal dictionary, i.e., its ontological commitment to a particular conceptualization of the world object. According to this approach, "n-D Tensor Calculus" can be considered a "Formal Language" to reliably compute optimized "n-Dimensional Tensor Invariants" as specific object "invariant parameter and attribute words" for automated n-Dimensional shape/texture optimal synthetic object description by incremental model generation. The class of those "invariant parameter and attribute words" can be thought as a specific "Formal Vocabulary" learned from a "Generalized Formal Dictionary" of the "Computational Tensor Invariants" language. Even object chromatic attributes can be effectively and reliably computed from object geometric parameters into robust colour shape invariant characteristics. As a matter of fact, any highly sophisticated application needing effective, robust object geometric/colour invariant attribute capture and parameterization features, for reliable automated object learning and discrimination can deeply benefit from GEOGINE (c)) progressive automated model generation computational kernel performance. Main operational advantages over previous, similar approaches are: 1) Progressive Automated Invariant Model Generation, 2) Invariant Minimal Complete Description Set for computational efficiency, 3) Arbitrary Model Precision for robust object description and identification.

Data-based revision of decision models is defined as follows: given an existing model and a set of data items, revise the model to match the data items. We propose and experimentally evaluate a method for the revision of probability distributions in qualitative hierarchical multi-attribute models of DEX methodology. The revision method is automatic, but limited to the modification of probability distributions in utility functions. The method is experimentally evaluated in an artificial domain. In all experiments, the classification accuracy of the revised model was improved and the changes of the model correctly reflected the simulated changes in the decision environment.

Although efficient supervised discretization methods are available, the unsupervised Equal Frequency discretization method is still widely used by the statistician both for data exploration and data preparation. In this paper, we propose an automatic method, based on a Bayesian approach, to optimize the number of bins for Equal Frequency discretizations in the context of supervised learning. We introduce a space of Equal Frequency discretization models and a prior distribution defined on this model space. This results in the definition of a Bayes optimal evaluation criterion for Equal Frequency discretizations. We then propose an optimal search algorithm whose run-time is super-linear in the sample size. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that the method works quite well in many cases.

J	Chen, WC; Yang, MC; Tseng, SS				Chen, Wei-Chou; Yang, Ming-Chun; Tseng, Shian-Shyong			A novel feature selection method for large-scale data sets	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						machine learning; knowledge discovery; feature selection; bitmap indexing; rough set		Feature selection is about finding useful (relevant) features to describe an application domain. The problem of finding the minimal subsets of features that can describe all of the concepts in the given data set is NP-hard. In the past, we had proposed a feature selection method, which originated from rough set and bitmap indexing techniques, to select the optimal (minimal) feature set for the given data set efficiently. Although our method is sufficient to guarantee a solution's optimality, the computation cost is very high when the number of features is huge. In this paper, we propose a nearly optimal feature selection method, called bitmap-based feature selection method with discernibility matrix, which employs a discernibility matrix to record the important features during the construction of the cleansing tree to reduce the processing time. And the corresponding indexing and selecting algorithms for such feature selection method are also proposed. Finally, some experiments and comparisons are given and the result shows the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed method.

Evaluating indirect and direct classification techniques for network intrusion detection	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						network intrusion detection; multi-category classifications; binary classifiers; combining strategies; base learners		The network intrusion detection domain has seen increased research that exploit data mining and machine learning techniques and principles. Typically, multi-category classification models are built to classify network traffic instances either as normal or belonging to a specific attack category. While many existing works on data mining in intrusion detection have focused on applying direct classification methods, to our knowledge indirect classification techniques have not been investigated for intrusion detection. In contrast to indirect classification techniques, direct classification techniques generally extend associated binary classifiers to handle multi-category classification problems. An indirect classification technique decomposes (binarization) the original multi-category problem into multiple binary classification problems. The classification technique used to train the set of binary classification problems is called the base classifier. Subsequently, a combining strategy is used to merge the results of the binary classifiers. We investigate two binarization techniques and three combining strategies, yielding six indirect classification methods. This study presents a comprehensive comparative study of five direct classification methods with the thirty indirect classification models ( six indirect classification models for each of the five base classifiers). To our knowledge, there are no existing works that evaluate as many indirect classification techniques and compare them with direct classification methods, particularly for network intrusion detection. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project is used to evaluate the different techniques. It is empirically shown that certain indirect classification techniques yield better network intrusion detection models.

A possible approach to cope with that fact is to get a whole view of the image(object). Then using machine learning approach from user's Relevance feedback to obtain a reduced feature. In this paper, we concentrate on some points about Biased Discriminant Analysis / Kernel Biased Discriminant Analysis (BDA/KBDA) based machine learning approach for CBIR. The contributions of this paper are: 1. using generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) based approach solve the small sample size problem in BDA/KBDA and 2. using histogram intersection as a kernel for KBDA. Experiments show that this kind of kernel gets improvement compare to other common kernels.

Cleaning and preprocessing of such data likely involves deduplication or linkage with other data, which is often challenged by a lack of unique entity identifiers. In recent years there has been an increased research effort in data linkage and deduplication, mainly in the machine learning and database communities. Publicly available test data with known deduplication or linkage status is needed so that new linkage algorithms and techniques can be tested, evaluated and compared. However, publication of data containing personal information is normally impossible due to privacy and confidentiality issues. An alternative is to use artificially created data, which has the advantages that content and error rates can be controlled, and the deduplication or linkage status is known. Controlled experiments can be performed and replicated easily. In this paper we present a freely available data set generator capable of creating data sets containing names, addresses and other personal information.

PTS1 peroxisomal proteins have a well conserved tripeptide at the C-terminal end. However, the preceding residues in the sequence arguably play a crucial role in targeting the protein to the peroxisome. Previous work in applying machine learning to the prediction of peroxisomal matrix proteins has failed W capitalize on the full extent of these dependencies. We benchmark a range of machine learning algorithms, and show that a classifier - based on the Support Vector Machine - produces more accurate results when dependencies between the conserved motif and the preceding section are exploited. We publish an updated and rigorously curated data set that results in increased prediction accuracy of most tested models.

Knowledge can be in different forms, for example, decision rules, decision trees, logical expressions, clusters, classifiers, and neural nets with discrete input variables. KV is implemented as a module of the inductive database system VINLEN, which integrates a conventional database system with a range of inductive inference and data mining capabilities. This paper describes briefly the KV module and then focuses on the problem of arranging attributes that span the diagram in a way that leads to the most readable rule visualization in the diagram. This problem has been solved by applying a simulated annealing.

This allows extension of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation methods nonparametric function estimation. Among other things, the resulting MAPN (MAP for nonparametric machine learning) procedure easily reproduces spline and radial basis function solutions of learning problems.

Complicated image such as medical image and remote sensing image, belong to image with natural textures, this kind of image is always of high resolution, with many layers of gray degree, and a very intricate shape structure. Because there are no obvious shapes, but only distributions of some gray degrees and colors in these images, so for them, there are no good methods yet for feature extraction and region recognition. In this paper, based on information augmentation and kinetics, we present a learning algorithm, which can be used to do region classification of the above-mentioned images with natural textures. We applied our algorithm to recognition of image with natural textures and obtained a good result.

Two codes of them are based respectively on biochemical properties, and the two others are generated with artificial intelligence (AI) methods, and are based on protein structures and alignment, and on Dayhoff matrix. In order to give a global significance of each binary code, we use a hierarchical clustering method to generate different clusters of each binary codes of amino acids. Each cluster is examined with biochemical properties to give an explanation on the similarity between amino acids that it contains. To validate our examination, a decision tree based machine learning system is used to characterize the AA clusters obtained with each binary codes. From this experimentation, it comes out that one of the AI based codes allows to obtain clusters that have significant biochemical properties. As a consequence, it appears that even if attributes of binary codes generated with AI methods, do not separately correspond to a biochemical property, they can be significant in the whole. Conversely binary codes based on biochemical properties can be insignificant when forming a whole.

In this article, the transductive learning machines are described based on a so-called affinity rule which comes from the intuitive fact that if two objects are close in input space then their outputs should also be close, to obtain the solution of semi-supervised learning problem. By using the analytic solution for this problem, an incremental learning algorithm adapting to on-line data processing is derived.

Web Personalization is viewed as an application of data mining and machine learning techniques to build models of user behaviour that can be applied to the task of predicting user needs and adapting future interactions with the ultimate goal of improved user satisfaction. This chapter survey's the state-of-the-art in Web personalization. We start by providing a description of the personalization process and a classification of the current approaches to Web personalization. We discuss the various sources of data available to personalization systems, the modelling approaches employed and the current approaches to evaluating these systems. A number of challenges faced by researchers developing these systems are described as are solutions to these challenges proposed in literature. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the open challenges that must be addressed by the research community if this technology is to make a positive impact on user satisfaction with the Web.

The target is to classify prismatic machined and cast-then-machined parts into their respective classification to assist the manufacturing cost estimation. Current research on shape matching techniques have used shape functions to match the gross shapes of mesh models. However they do not adequately discrimate artifacts manufactured by different processes. Our approach shows how different kinds of surfaces can distinguish different manufacturing processes. Statistics on surface curvatures are used to construct shape descriptors; then supervised machine learning classifier support vector machines are applied to separate the two classifications.

This paper investigates the problem of feature subset selection using a committee of filter, wrapper and embedded methods. The wrappers were implemented using two different search mechanisms, a genetic algorithm and a best-first procedure as well as three different machine learning paradigms: instance-based (Nearest Neighbor - NN), neural network (DistAl) and symbolic (C4.5). The two filter methods used are based on consistency and correlation measures. The goals of the experiments were to be able to identify the most suitable attribute subsets to be further used for inducing a classifier as well as investigate if the combination of different results given by the committee's members can outperform any machine learning method using the original training set.

Generally speaking, NNTrees can outperform standard DTs because the ENNs can extract more complex features. However, induction of multivariate DTs is very difficult. Even if each non-terminal node contains a simple oblique hyperplane, the induction problem can be NP-complete. To solve this problem, we have introduced an evolutionary algorithm that follows the same recursive procedure for inducing a standard DT and designs an ENN for each non-terminal node using GA (genetic algorithm). This algorithm, however is very time consuming and cannot be used easily. In this paper we propose two new methods. One is to evolve the whole tree instead of evolving the ENNs recursively. Another is to define the group labels for the examples assigned to each non-terminal node using a heuristic method, and design the ENNs with the back propagation (BP) algorithm. Experimental results with 10 public databases show that the BP based algorithm is much more efficient than GA based algorithms.

However, the choice of the number of classifiers and the fusion method are usually based on ad-hoc selection. In this paper, we propose a novel quantitative measure of the generalization error for MCS. The localized generalization error model bounds above the mean square error (MSE) of a MCS for unseen samples located within a neighborhood of the training samples. The relationship between the proposed model and classification accuracy is also discussed in this paper. This model quantitatively measures the goodness of the MCS in approximating the unknown input-output mapping hidden in the training dataset. The localized generalization error model is applied to select a MCS, among different choices of number of classifiers and fusion methods, for a given classification problem. Experimental results on three real world datasets are performed to show promising results.

The novel mechanism is performed by means of a set of computing cell operations such as self-generation, growth, self-division, and death. Under the mechanism, a computing network grows up to a mature network. A hidden cell in the network is defined as a condition matching-unit in response to a fuzzy sub-superspace in multiple-dimension input superspace. A sense-function is defined to represent connections from a hidden cell to input cells. The range and edge vagueness of the sense-function are determined by evolving learning mechanism when sample instances are presented to the network. This network is able to learn from a very few training instances to make decisions for unseen instances. The benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are applied to test the network and comparable results are obtained.

Perhaps two of the most promising control tools for freeway corridors are traffic-responsive ramp metering and/or dynamic traffic diversion possibly using variable message signs (VMS). The aim of the research approach presented in this paper is to develop a self-learning "adaptive independent and integrated freeway control for both recurring and non-recurring congestion. The paper introduces the use of Reinforcement learning, an Artificial Intelligence method for machine learning, to provide optimal controls using ramp metering and VMS routing independently and also as an integrated manner. Results from various simulation case studies in Toronto are very encouraging and discussed in the paper.

If the data set is large, however the induced DT may be too large to understand. Currently, we have proposed a non-genetic evolutionary algorithm called R(4)-rule for producing the smallest nearest neighbor classifiers (NNCs). In this paper we propose two new approaches for inducing DTs with the R(4)-rule. The DTs considered here are multivariate, and there is an NNC with two or more prototypes in each non-terminal node. In the first method, the prototypes are found directly from the training set. In the second method, the prototypes are found from the data assigned to each non-terminal node. Using these methods, we can induce more compact and more comprehensible DTs. The efficiency and efficacy of the methods are verified through experiments with several public databases.

Previous methods use keywords contained in e-mails to extract binary features from the corpus. However, since keywords of e-mails change from time to time, the performance of keyword-based solution is not stable. In this study, we use behaviors of spammers as the features for classifying e-mails. Such behaviors are first described by meta-heuristics and used as features of e-mails for classification. A total of 113 new features are extracted from the given meta-heuristics. Using existing machine learning techniques, the filtering performance is much better than that using keyword-based filtering. In addition, the training time is substantially reduced because of the low dimensional feature space and sparse feature vectors.

J	Qahwaji, R; Colak, T				Qahwaji, R; Colak, T			Automatic detection and verification of solar features	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						image processing; solar imaging; morphological transforms; neural networks	CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS	A fast hybrid system for the automated detection and verification of active regions (plages) and filaments in solar images is presented in this paper. The system combines automated image processing with machine learning. The imaging part consists of five major stages. The solar disk is detected in the first stage, using a morphological hit-miss transform, watershed transform and Filling algorithm. An image-enhancement technique is introduced to remove the limb-darkening effect and intensity filtering is implemented followed by a modified region-growing technique to detect the regions of interest (Rol). The algorithms are tested on H-a and CA II K3-line solar images that are obtained from Meudon Observatory, covering the period from July 2, 2001 till August 4, 2001. The detection algorithm is fast and it achieves false acceptance rate (FAR) error rate of 67% and false rejection rate (FRR) error rate of 3% for active regions, and FAR error rate of 19% and FRR error rate of 14% for filaments, when compared with the manually detected filaments in the synoptic maps. The detection performance is enhanced further using a neural network (NN), which is trained on statistical features extracted from the Rol and non-Rol.

Instead the usually follow specific trajectories or motion patterns corresponding to their intentions. Knowledge about such patterns enables a mobile robot to robustly keep track of persons in its enironment and to improve its behavior. In this paper we propose a technique for learning collections of trajectories that characterize typical motion patterns of persons. Data recorded with laser-range finders are clustered using the expectation maximization algorithin. Based on the result of the clustering process, we derive a hidden Markov model that is applied to estimate the current and future positions of persons based on sensory input. We also describe how to incorporate the probabilistic belief about the potential trajectories of persons into the path planning process of a mobile robot. We present several experiments carried out in different environments with a mobile robot equipped with a laser-range scanner and a camera system. The results demonstrate that our approach can reliably learn motion patterns of persons, can robustly estimate and predict positions of persons. and can be used to improve the navigation behavior of a mobile robot.

B	Yang, HC; Lee, CH			IEEE Computer Society	Yang, HC; Lee, CH			Automatic metadata generation for Web pages using a text mining approach	International Workshop on Challenges in Web Information Retrieval and Integration, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Challenges in Web Information Retrieval and Integration	APR 08-09, 2005	Tokyo, JAPAN	IEEE Comp Soc, Database Soc Japan, Informat Proc Soc Japan, Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engn				The Semantic Web has emerged to replace the World Wide Web (WWW or the Web) as the unique platform for information sharing. Applications such as e-commerce will be and could be plausible only if we can annotate the Web pages with their semantics. For newly developed Semantic Web resources, such annotation can be done manually or by help of some authoring tools. However, it is not practical to semantically annotating existing Web pages due to the gigantic amount of them. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a machine learning approach to automatically generate semantic metadata for Web pages. The proposed automated process adopts the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster training Web pages and conducts a text mining process to discover some semantic descriptions about the Web pages. Preliminary experiments show that our method may generate semantically relevant metadata for the Web pages.

We believe that it may be more useful to involve the human throughout the recognition process rather than just at the beginning or end. We describe a methodology of interactive visual recognition for human-centered low-throughput applications, Computer Assisted Visual InterActive Recognition (CAVIAR), and discuss the prospects of implementing CAVIAR over the Internet. The novelty of CAVIAR is image-based interaction through a domain-specific parameterized geometrical model, which reduces the semantic gap between humans and computers. The user may interact with the computer anytime that she considers its response unsatisfactory. The interaction improves the accuracy of the classification features by improving the fit of the computer-proposed model. The computer makes subsequent use of the parameters of the improved model to refine not only its own statistical model-fitting process, but also its internal classifier. The CAVIAR methodology was applied to implement a flower recognition system. The principal conclusions from the evaluation of the system include: 1) the average recognition time of the CAVIAR system is significantly shorter than that of the unaided human, 2) its accuracy is significantly higher than that of the unaided machine; 3) it can be initialized with as few as one training sample per class and still achieve high accuracy; and 4) it demonstrates a self-learning ability. We have also implemented a Mobile CAVIAR system, where a pocket PC, as a client, connects to a server through wireless communication. The motivation behind a mobile platform for CAVIAR is to apply the methodology in a human-centered pervasive environment, where the user can seamlessly interact with the system for classifying field-data. Deploying CAVIAR to a networked mobile platform poses the challenge of classifying field images and programming under constraints of display size, network bandwidth, processor speed, and memory size. Editing of the computer-proposed model is performed on the handheld while statistical model fitting and classification take place on the server. The possibility that the user can easily take several photos of the object poses an interesting information fusion problem. The advantage of the Internet is that the patterns identified by different users can be pooled together to benefit all peer users. When users identify patterns with CAVIAR in a networked setting, they also collect training samples and provide opportunities for machine learning from their intervention. CAVIAR implemented over the Internet provides a perfect test bed for, and extends, the concept of Open Mind Initiative proposed by David Stork. Our experimental evaluation focuses on human time, machine and human accuracy, and machine learning. We devoted much effort to evaluating the use of our image-based user interface and on developing principles for the evaluation of interactive pattern recognition system. The Internet architecture and Mobile CAVIAR methodology have many applications. We are exploring in the directions of teledermatology, face recognition, and education.

In Machine Learning (ML), genetic algorithms have been utilized for search through a space of all possible concept descriptions. We designed and implemented a system that merges a domain-independent GA into the covering learning algorithm CN4, a large extension of the well-known CN2. In this paper, we present some recent improvements of the above learning algorithm (which we call GA-CN4). The paper particularly discusses the representation of decision rules as chromosomes (objects, individuals) in GAs, and the ways of initialization of a population for a GA. We conclude by description and analysis of a few experiments that were carried out in order to compare various approaches to initialization of a population for GAs.

This ubiquitous computing system supports an automatic selection of media and modalities deemed appropriate for the user's context and user's profile. The ability of the system to do so constitutes its acquired knowledge. The decision making for media/modality selection takes into account if the user has some special needs due to disability. The architecture of the system is designed to be pervasive and is conceived to resist failure. In case of one or more components being missing or found defective, the machine would resist failure by reconfiguring itself dynamically in the architectural level. It finds alternative replacement to the failed component using its acquired knowledge.

The paper aims to study to what a degree the three communities explore others' ideas, methods, findings. To that purpose we studied direct links (do authors from one community cite authors from another) and indirect links (using bibliographic coupling). Although the study is based on a small sample of 148 papers, the results indicate that the three communities do not exchange ideas to a great extent.

Annotation plays a crucial role for the indexing and performance of a CBIR system. Prevalent retrieval techniques involve human-supplied text annotations of the content of an image regions. We are developing a system which annotates and indexes the regions of an image as soon as it is registered into the system. The proposed approach has two main components. At first a submitted image is partitioned into homogeneous regions by a segmentation technique. Then the segmented regions are annotated using a knowledge base system (KBS). The KBS contains pattern signatures created by machine learning and heuristic rules acquired from the domain experts.

At present, Chinese question classification is based on the combinatorial rules between the interrogative and its interrelated words. However, because the extraction of rules greatly dependeds on expert's experience knowledge, the classification effect will be impacted. In this paper, the Chinese question types are defined; a question classification machine learning model based on SVM is established; the course of selecting feature and extracting feature using SVM for question classification is described in detail; question classification experiment is done by augmenting respectively semantic feature on the baseline of syntactic feature; experiment have achieved accuracy of 88.6%; This result demonstrate that combining syntactic feature and semantic feature has a very good effect on Chinese question classification.

Feature selection is performed by generating random collections of features, and then refining these features using genetic algorithm (GA). A support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier for different feature subsets during the feature selection stage. To indicate the best accuracy/complexity trade-off, a combination function with 5-fold cross-validation accuracy and the number of features are used to derive fitness scores. Comprehensive experiments on two data sets in the UCI machine learning repository confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

This paper presents a hybrid approach of a text-mining technique for measuring semantic relatedness among texts. In this work we develop several text classifiers using Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to supporting acquisition of relatedness among texts. First, we utilized our developed text mining algorithms, including text mining techniques based on classification of texts in several text collections. After that, we employ various SVM classifiers to deal with evaluation of relatedness of the target documents. The results indicate that this approach can also be fitted to other research work, such as information filtering, and re-categorizing resulting documents of search engine queries.

Because it is difficult to prepare the training data, anomaly detection systems are not widely used in the practical environment. In this paper we propose an anomaly detection system based on machine learning that requires no prepared training data. The system generates sophisticated training data that is applicable to the learning by processing alerts that a signature based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) outputs. We evaluated the system using two types of traffic: the 1999 DARPA IDS evaluation data and the security scanner data. The results show that the training data generated by the system is suitable for learning attack behaviors and the system is able to detect variants of worms and known attacks.

In this paper, author explores the use of the expert judgment and machine learning techniques using neural network as well as referencing COCOMO II approach to predict the cost of software. Some primary work in the use of neural network in estimating software cost by, [WITTIG & FINNIE] and Karunanithi [3] produced very accurate results, but the major setback in their, work was due to the fact that the accuracy of the result relied heavily on the size of the training set [4]. Understanding the adversity in applying neural networks, the author proposes a dynamic neural network that will initially use COCOMO II. The proposed network improves its estimation as the number of data set increases with input from expert judgment that affects the learning procedure.

This is important in cases where the training set needs to be built mostly manually, as in the case that we studied, the recognition of the Honda Accord 2004 from rear views. Our experiments indicated that the set of features used by Viola and others for face recognition was inefficient for our problem; therefore, each object requires its own custom-made set of features for real time and accurate recognition. We described a set of appropriate feature types for the considered car recognition problem, including a redness measure and dominant edge orientations. The existing edge orientation bin division was improved by shifting so that all horizontal (vertical, respectively) edges belong to the same bin. This feature set was a basis for building a fast and reliable car recognizer based on small training set, consisting of 155 positive and 760 negative images.

J	Jordan, PW; Walker, MA				Jordan, PW; Walker, MA			Learning content selection rules for generating object descriptions in dialogue	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							NATURAL-LANGUAGE GENERATION; REFERRING EXPRESSIONS; SYSTEMS; TASK	A fundamental requirement of any task-oriented dialogue system is the ability to generate object descriptions that refer to objects in the task domain. The subproblem of content selection for object descriptions in task-oriented dialogue has been the focus of much previous work and a large number of models have been proposed. In this paper, we use the annotated coconut corpus of task-oriented design dialogues to develop feature sets based on Dale and Reiter's (1995) incremental model, Brennan and Clark's (1996) conceptual pact model, and Jordan's (2000b) intentional influences model, and use these feature sets in a machine learning experiment to automatically learn a model of content selection for object descriptions. Since Dale and Reiter's model requires a representation of discourse structure, the corpus annotations are used to derive a representation based on Grosz and Sidner's (1986) theory of the intentional structure of discourse, as well as two very simple representations of discourse structure based purely on recency. We then apply the rule-induction program ripper to train and test the content selection component of an object description generator on a set of 393 object descriptions from the corpus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported experiment of a trainable content selection component for object description generation in dialogue. Three separate content selection models that are based on the three theoretical models, all independently achieve accuracies significantly above the majority class baseline (17%) on unseen test data, with the intentional influences model (42.4%) performing significantly better than either the incremental model (30.4%) or the conceptual pact model (28.9%). But the best performing models combine all the feature sets, achieving accuracies near 60%. Surprisingly, a simple recency-based representation of discourse structure does as well as one based on intentional structure. To our knowledge, this is also the first empirical comparison of a representation of Grosz and Sidner's model of discourse structure with a simpler model for any generation task.

J	Khardon, R; Roth, D; Servedio, RA				Khardon, R; Roth, D; Servedio, RA			Efficiency versus convergence of Boolean kernals for on-line learning algorithms	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							PERCEPTRON; MODEL; BRAIN	The paper studies machine learning problems where each example is described using a set of Boolean features and where hypotheses are represented by linear threshold elements. One method of increasing the expressiveness of learned hypotheses in this context is to expand the feature set to include conjunctions of basic features. This can be done explicitly or where possible by using a kernel function. Focusing on the well known Perceptron and Winnow algorithms, the paper demonstrates a tradeoff between the computational efficiency with which the algorithm can be run over the expanded feature space and the generalization ability of the corresponding learning algorithm. We first describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to efficiently run the Perceptron algorithm over a feature space of exponentially many conjunctions; however we also show that using such kernels, the Perceptron algorithm can provably make an exponential number of mistakes even when learning simple functions. We then consider the question of whether kernel functions can analogously be used to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. Known upper bounds imply that the Winnow algorithm can learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting. However, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnow's behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set. This implies that the kernel functions which correspond to running Winnow for this problem are not efficiently computable, and that there is no general construction that can run Winnow with kernels.

J	Dutta, PS; Jennings, NR; Moreau, L				Dutta, PS; Jennings, NR; Moreau, L			Cooperative information sharing to improve distributed learning in multi-agent systems	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							FRAMEWORK; TEAMWORK	Effective coordination of agents' actions in partially-observable domains is a major challenge of multi-agent systems research. To address this, many researchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions based on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically learnt using some form of machine learning algorithm. Nevertheless. many of these approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary information is made available so that the estimates can be learnt. To this end., we argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is one such mechanism. However., in a dynamically changing environment. the accuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity of the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on these. Given this. we propose a novel information-sharing protocol, post-task-completion sharing. for the distribution of state information. We then show, through a formal analysis, the improvement in the quality of estimates produced using our strategy over the widely used protocol of sharing information between nearest neighbours. Moreover. communication heuristics designed around our information-sharing principle are subjected to empirical evaluation along with other benchmark strategies (including Littman's (a-routing and Stone's TPOT-RL) in a simulated call-routing application. These studies, conducted across a range of environmental settings, show that, compared to the different benchmarks used, our strategy generates an improvement of up to 60% in the call connection rate: of more than 1000% in the ability to connect long-distance calls: and incurs as low as 0.25 of the message overhead.

The molecular descriptors were selected by heuristic method (HM) implemented in CODESSA. At the same time, in order to show the influence of different molecular descriptors on absorption and to well understand the absorption mechanism, HM was used to build several multivariable linear models using different numbers of molecular descriptors. Both the linear and non-linear model can give satisfactory prediction results: the square of correlation coefficient R-2 was 0.78 and 0.86 for the training set, and 0.70 and 0.73 for the test set respectively.

J	Zhou, ZH; Yu, Y				Zhou, ZH; Yu, Y			Adapt bagging to nearest neighbor classifiers	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						bagging; data mining; ensemble learning; machine learning; Minkowsky distance; nearest neighbor; value difference metric	ENSEMBLES	It is well-known that in order to build a strong ensemble, the component learners should be with high diversity as well as high accuracy. If perturbing the training set can cause significant changes in the component learners constructed, then Bagging can effectively improve accuracy. However, for stable learners such as nearest neighbor classifiers, perturbing the training set can hardly produce diverse component learners, therefore Bagging does not work well. This paper adapts Bagging to nearest neighbor classifiers through injecting randomness to distance metrics. In constructing the component learners, both the training set and the distance metric employed for identifying the neighbors are perturbed. A large scale empirical study reported in this paper shows that the proposed BagInRand algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of nearest neighbor classifiers.

More extensive search is time consuming and usually does not benefit prediction accuracy as much as one would hope. It has even been claimed that look-ahead would be harmful in decision tree learning. The pathological effects of look-ahead have been studied analytically in the context of game trees. These results and their connection to decision tree learning are considered. A computationally efficient splitting algorithm for numerical domains is presented, which is based on ideas from search tree look-ahead. In empirical tests, the algorithm performs in a promising manner.

In this paper, we propose a quasi-clustering method, network classification, which improves upon the computational efficiency of traditional conceptual clustering methods. Network classification is based on the Power Law assumption and the concept of hub observations/instances. The method is evaluated in several domains and compared with examples of both unsupervised learning and supervised learning methods. The results show that network classification maintains a comparable forecasting accuracy, while exhibiting an improved computing performance over conceptual clustering methods.

Data types and type-classes for statistical models are developed that allow models to be manipulated in a precise, type-safe and flexible way. The statistical models considered include probability distributions, mixture models, function-models, time-series, and classification- and function-model-trees. The aim is to improve ways of designing and programming with models, not only of applying them.

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.

This can be accomplished through semantic annotations. Unfortunately, manual annotation is tedious, time consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a tool, called iASA, that learns to automatically annotate web documents according to an ontology. iASA is based on the combination of information extraction (specifically, the Similarity-based Rule Learner-SRL) and machine learning techniques. Using linguistic knowledge and optimal dynamic window size, SRL produces annotation rules of better quality than comparable semantic annotation systems. Similarity-based learning efficiently reduces the search space by avoiding pseudo rule generalization. In the annotation phase, iASA exploits ontology knowledge to refine the annotation it proposes. Moreover, our annotation algorithm exploits machine learning methods to correctly select instances and to predict missing instances. Finally, iASA provides an explanation component that explains the nature of the learner and annotator to the user. Explanations can greatly help users understand the rule induction and annotation process, so that they can focus on correcting rules and annotations quickly. Experimental results show that iASA can reach high accuracy quickly.

Due to the history of Behavior Finance, many researches have found that the shape of stock trend is not following random walk model, but the repeated trading patterns exist which are referred to as investors experiences. Furthermore, some classical researches have been merely adopted traditional artificial intelligence to analyze the result. Those methodologies are not sufficiently to resolve the dynamical problem, such as economical trading behaviors. Therefore, the model has been proposed concerning intraday trading but avoiding the system risk in the short-term position to benefit investors. By dynamic learning ability of XCS and general population features, the output operation suggestions could be obtained as a reference strategy for investors to predict the index option trend. As an example of Taiwan Index option, the results of the accuracy and accumulative profit have been exhibited remarkable outcome, and so as the simulations of short term prediction with 10-minute and 20-minute tick data.

Using sets of If-then rules is the most expressive and readable manner. To find If-then rules, many induction algorithms such as ID3, AQ, CN2 and their variants, were proposed. Sequential covering is the kernel technique of them. To avoid testing all possible selectors, Entropy gain is used to select the best attribute in ID3. Constraint of the size of star was introduced in AQ and beam search was adopted in CN2. These methods speed up their induction algorithms but many good selectors are filtered out. In this work, we introduce a new induction algorithm that is based on enumeration of all possible selectors. Contrary to the previous works, we use pruning power to reduce irrelative selectors. But we can guarantee that no good selectors are filtered out. Comparing with other techniques, the experiment results demonstrate that the rules produced by our induction algorithm have high consistency and simplicity.

Based on the principle of natural evolution and global searching, a genetic algorithm is promising for obtaining better results. This article adopts the learning classifier systems (LCS) technique to provide a hybrid knowledge integration strategy, which makes for continuous and instant teaming while integrating multiple rule sets into a centralized knowledge base. This paper makes three important contributions: (1) it provides a knowledge encoding methodology to represent various rule sets that are derived from different sources, and that are encoded as a fixed-length bit string; (2) it proposes a knowledge integration methodology to apply genetic operations and credit assignment to generate optimal rule sets; (3) it uses three criteria (accuracy, coverage, and fitness) to apply the knowledge extraction process, which is very effective in selecting an optimal set of rules from a large population. The experiments prove that the rule sets derived by the proposed approach is more accurate than the Fuzzy ID3 algorithm.

Due to incomplete biomedical information databases, the extraction cannot be done straightforward using dictionaries, so several approaches using contextual rules and machine learning have previously been proposed. Our work is inspired by the previous approaches, but is novel in the sense that it combines Google and Gene Ontology for annotating protein interactions. We got promising empirical results - 57.5% terms as valid GO annotations, and 16.9% protein names in the answers provided by our system gProt.

One of the challenges is to acquire an indexing vocabulary to describe cases. We explore the use of machine learning and statistical techniques to automate aspects of this acquisition task. A propositional semantic indexing tool, PSI, which forms its indexing vocabulary from new features extracted as logical combinations of existing keywords, is presented. We propose that such logical combinations correspond more closely to natural concepts and are more transparent than linear combinations. Experiments show PSI-derived case representations to have superior retrieval performance to the original keyword-based representations. PSI also has comparable performance to Latent Semantic Indexing, a popular dimensionality reduction technique for text, which unlike PSI generates linear combinations of the original features.

While this property is widely considered to be a crucial one in fuzzy rule-based modeling, a more detailed formal investigation of what "interpretability" actually means is not available. So fax, interpretability has most often been associated with rather heuristic assumptions about shape and mutual overlapping of fuzzy membership functions. In this paper, we attempt to approach this problem from a more general and formal point of view. First, we clarify what the different aspects of interpretability are in our opinion. Consequently, we propose an axiomatic framework for dealing with the interpretability of linguistic variables (in Zadeh's original sense) which is underlined by examples and application aspects, such as, fuzzy systems design aid, data-driven learning and tuning, and rule base simplification.

Currently such classifications rely on selected packet header fields (e.g. port numbers) or application layer protocol decoding. These methods have a number of shortfalls e.g. many applications can use unpredictable port numbers and protocol decoding requires a high amount of computing resources or is simply infeasible in case protocols are unknown or encrypted. We propose a novel method for traffic classification and application identification using an unsupervised machine learning technique. Flows are automatically classified based on statistical flow characteristics. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using data from several traffic traces collected at different locations of the Internet. We use feature selection to find an optimal feature set and determine the influence of different features.

We define a model of leamability for ranking functions in a particular setting of the ranking problem known as the bipartite ranking problem, and derive a number of results in this model. Our first main result provides a sufficient condition for the leamability of a class of ranking functions F: we show that F is learnable if its bipartite rank-shatter coefficients, which measure the richness of a ranking function class in the same way as do the standard VC-dimension related shatter coefficients (growth function) for classes of classification functions, do not grow too quickly. Our second main result gives a necessary condition for leamability: we define a new combinatorial parameter for a class of ranking functions F that we term the rank dimension of F, and show that F is learnable only if its rank dimension is finite. Finally, we investigate questions of the computational complexity of learning ranking functions.

We study generalization properties of ranking algorithms, in a particular setting of the ranking problem known as the bipartite ranking problem, using the notion of algorithmic stability. In particular, we derive generalization bounds for bipartite ranking algorithms that have good stability properties. We show that kernel-based ranking algorithms that perform regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space have such stability properties, and therefore our bounds can be applied to these algorithms; this is in contrast with previous generalization bounds for ranking, which are based on uniform convergence and in many cases cannot be applied to these algorithms. A comparison (if the bounds we obtain with corresponding bounds for classification algorithms yields some interesting insights into the difference in generalization behaviour between ranking and classification.

However, the assumptions these methods are based on are often quite distinct and not captured by standard theoretical models. In this paper we describe a PAC-style framework that can be used to model many of these assumptions, and analyze sample-complexity issues in this setting: that is, how much of each type of data one should expect to need in order to learn well, and what are the basic quantities that these numbers depend on. Our model can be viewed as an extension of the standard PAC model, where in addition to a concept class C, one also proposes a type of compatibility that one believes the target concept should have with the underlying distribution. In this view, unlabeled data can be helpful because it allows one to estimate compatibility over the space of hypotheses, and reduce the size of the search space to those that, according to one's assumptions, are a-priori reasonable with respect to the distribution. We discuss a number of technical issues that arise in this context, and provide sample-complexity bounds both for uniform convergence and c-cover based algorithms. We also consider algorithmic issues, and give an efficient algorithm for a special case of co-training.

Even though this assertion serves as a justification for many Laplacian-based algorithms, so far only some aspects of this claim have been rigorously proved. In this paper we close this gap by establishing the strong pointwise consistency of a family of graph Laplacians with data-dependent weights to some weighted Laplace operator. Our investigation also includes the important case where the data lies on a submanifold of R-d.

However most algorithms in that class may be termed "manifold-motivated" as they lack any explicit theoretical guarantees. In this paper we take a step towards closing the gap between theory and practice for a class of Laplacian-based manifold methods. We show that under certain conditions the graph Laplacian of a point cloud converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the underlying manifold. Theorem 1 contains the first result showing convergence of a random graph Laplacian to manifold Laplacian in the machine learning context.

J	Na, JC; Khoo, C; Wu, PHJ				Na, JC; Khoo, C; Wu, PHJ			Use of negation phrases in automatic sentiment classification of product reviews	LIBRARY COLLECTIONS ACQUISITIONS & TECHNICAL SERVICES			English	Article							NEWS	This paper reports a study in automatic sentiment classification, i.e., automatically classifying documents as expressing positive or negative sentiments. The Study investigates the effectiveness of using a machine-learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), on various text features to classify on-line product reviews into recommended (positive sentiment) and not recommended (negative sentiment). In the first part of this study, several approaches, unigrams (individual words), selected words (such as verb, adjective, and adverb), and words labeled with part-of-speech tags were investigated. Using SVM, the unigram approach obtained an accuracy rate of around 76%. Error analysis suggests various approaches for improving classification accuracy: handling of negation phrases, inferencing from superficial words, and handling the problem of comments on parts of the product. The second part of the study investigated the use of negation phrase n-grams to improve classification accuracy. This approach increased the accuracy rate to 79.33%. Compared with traditional subject classification which mainly uses unigrams, syntactic and semantic processing of text appear more important for sentiment classification. We expect that deeper linguistic processing will help increase accuracy for sentiment classification. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While high accuracy learners have intensively been explored, interpretability still poses a difficult problem, largely because it can hardly be formalized in a general way. To circumvent this problem, one can often find a model in a hypothesis space that the user regards as understandable or minimize a user-defined measure of complexity, such that the obtained model describes the essential part of the data. To find interesting parts of the data, unsupervised learning has defined the task of detecting local patterns and subgroup discovery. In this paper, the problem of detecting local classification models is formalized. A multi-classifier algorithm is presented that finds a global model that essentially describes the data, can be used with almost any kind of base learner and still provides an interpretable combined model.

Misclassification costs, which reflect the different level of class identification importance, are integrated into the weight update formula of AdaBoost algorithm. Yet, it has been shown that the weight update parameter of AdaBoost is induced so as the training error can be reduced most rapidly. This is the most crucial step of AdaBoost in converting a weak learning algorithm into a strong one. However, most reported cost-sensitive boosting algorithms ignore such a property. In this paper, we come up with three versions of cost-sensitive AdaBoost algorithms where the parameters for sample weight updating are induced. Then, their identification abilities on the small classes are tested on four "real world" medical data sets taken from UCI Machine Learning Database based on F-measure. Our experimental results show that one of our proposed cost-sensitive AdaBoost algorithms is superior in achieving the best identification ability on the small class among all reported cost-sensitive boosting algorithms.

In case of very large number of values, the risk of overfilling the data increases sharply and building good groupings becomes difficult. In this paper, we propose two new grouping methods founded on a Bayesian approach, leading to Bayes optimal groupings. The first method exploits a standard schema for grouping models and the second one extends this schema by managing a "garbage" group dedicated to the least frequent values.

It often uses advanced data mining and machine learning methodologies to perform prediction or pattern recognition tasks. This paper describes a new method for prediction of protein secondary structure content based on feature selection and multiple linear regression. The method develops a novel representation of primary protein sequences based on a large set of 495 features. The feature selection task performed using very large set of nearly 6,000 proteins, and tests performed on standard non-homologues protein sets confirm high quality of the developed solution. The application of feature selection and the novel representation resulted in 14-15% error rate reduction when compared to results achieved when standard representation is used. The prediction tests also show that a small set of 5-25 features is sufficient to achieve accurate prediction for both helix and strand content for non-homologous proteins.

Tailored for the clinical environment, the proposed segmentation method consists of two stages: a learning stage and a clinical segmentation stage. During the learning stage, manually chosen representative images are segmented using a variational level set method driven by a pathologically modelled energy functional. Then a window-based feature extraction is applied to the segmented images. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to these extracted features and the results are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. During the clinical segmentation stage, the input clinical images are classified with the trained SVM. By the proposed method, we take the strengths of both machine learning and variational level set while limiting their weaknesses to achieve automatic and fast clinical segmentation. Both chest (thoracic) computed tomography (CT) scans (2D and 3D) and dental X-rays are used to test the proposed method. Promising results are demonstrated and analyzed. The proposed method can be used during preprocessing for automatic computer aided diagnosis.

Although fusion of multiple views can already be done reliably, planning is still limited to gathering the next best view, normally the one providing the highest immediate gain in information. In this paper, we show how to perform a generally more intelligent, long-run optimized sequence of actions by linking them with costs. Therefore it will be introduced how to acquire the cost of an appropriate dimensionality in a non-empirical way while still leaving the determination of the system's basic behavior to the user. Since this planning process is accomplished by an underlying machine learning technique, we also point out the ease of adjusting these to the expanded task and show why to use a multi-step approach for doing so.

It is widely known that the choice of the proper description language for a learning problem can affect the efficacy and effectiveness of the learning task. Furthermore, most real-world domains are affected by various kinds of imperfections in data, such as inappropriateness of the description language which does not contain/facilitate an exact representation of the target concept. To deal with such kind of situations, Machine Learning. approaches moved from a framework exploiting a single inference mechanism, such as induction, towards one integrating multiple inference strategies such as abstraction. The literature so far assumed that the information needed to the learning systems to apply additional inference strategies is provided by a domain expert. The goal of this work is the automatic inference of such information. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested by providing the generated abstraction theories to the learning system INTHELEX as a background knowledge to exploit its abstraction capabilities. Various experiments were carried out on the real-world application domain of scientific paper documents, showing the validity of the approach.

In many applications, such as those with unequal misclassification costs, producing good class probability estimates (CPEs) is more important than optimizing classification accuracy. We introduce novel approaches to active learning based on the algorithms Bootstrap-LV and ACTIVEDECORATE, by using Jensen-Shannon divergence (a similarity measure for probability distributions) to improve sample selection for optimizing CPEs. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the benetits of our approaches.

However, they are sensitive to kernel selection, they may have low tolerance to noise, and they can not deal with mixed-type or missing data. We propose to derive a novel kernel from an ensemble of decision trees. This leads to kernel methods that naturally handle noisy and heterogeneous data with potentially non-randomly missing values.

However, generating rules is not an end in itself because their applicability is not so straightforward. Indeed, the user is often overwhelmed when faced with a large number of rules. In this paper, we propose an approach to lighten this burden when the user wishes to exploit such rules to decide which actions to do given an unsatisfactory situation. The method consists in comparing a situation to a set of classification rules. This is achieved using a suitable distance thus allowing to suggest action recommendations with minimal changes to improve that situation. We propose the algorithm DAKAR for learning action recommendations and we present an application to an environmental protection issue. Our experiment shows the usefulness of our contribution in decision-making but also raises concerns about the impact of the redundancy of a set of rules in learning action recommendations of quality.

A theoretic analysis based on the game theory shows that the algorithm can learn the target hypothesis asymptotically. The comparison results using several datasets of the UCI machine learning repository and synthetic data are promising and show that Network Boosting has much resistance to the noisy data than AdaBoost through the cooperation of classifiers in the classifier network.

In real world situations, however, the class distribution changes, and is known to erode the effectiveness of classifiers and calibrated probability estimators. This paper focuses on the problem of accurately estimating the number of positives in the test set-quantification-as opposed to classifying individual cases accurately. It compares three methods: classify & count, an adjusted variant, and a mixture model. An empirical evaluation on a text classification benchmark reveals that the simple method is consistently biased, and that the mixture model is surprisingly effective even when positives are very scarce in the training set-a common case in information retrieval.

But when solving problems in the real world systems, the execution of a plan that theoretically solves a problem, can fail because of not properly capturing the special features of an object in the initial representation. We propose to capture this uncertainty about the world with an architecture that integrates planning, execution and learning. In this paper, we describe the PELA system (Planning-Execution-Learning Architecture). This system generates plans, executes those plans in the real world, and automatically acquires knowledge about the behaviour of the objects to strengthen the execution processes in the future.

The first is a generic metatechnique for classifier improvement showing performances comparable to boosting. The second lies in the ability of using the learned concept in constraint-based decision or optimization problems. It opens a new way of integrating Machine Learning in Decision Support Systems.

Nevertheless, it is recognized that efficiency and scalability is a major obstacle to an increased usage of ILP systems in complex applications with large hypotheses spaces. In this work, we focus on improving the efficiency and scalability of ILP systems by exploring tabling mechanisms available in the underlying Logic Programming systems. Tabling is an implementation technique that improves the declarativeness and performance of Prolog systems by reusing answers to subgoals. To validate our approach, we ran the April ILP system in the YapTab Prolog tabling system using two well-known datasets. The results obtained show quite impressive gains without changing the accuracy and quality of the theories generated.

Multimodal interfaces and architectures are time-critical and data-intensive to develop, which poses new research challenges. The goal of the present work is to model and adapt to users' multimodal integration patterns, so that faster and more robust systems can be developed with on-line adaptation to individual's multimodal temporal thresholds. In this paper, we summarize past user-modeling results on speech and pen multimodal integration patterns, which indicate that there are two dominant types of multimodal integration pattern among users that can be detected very early and remain highly consistent. The empirical results also indicate that, when interacting with a multimodal system, users intermix unimodal with multimodal commands. Based on these results, we present new machine-learning results comparing three models of on-line system adaptation to users' integration patterns, which were based on Bayesian Belief Networks. This work utilized data from ten adults who provided approximately 1,000 commands while interacting with a map-based multimodal system. Initial experimental results with our learning models indicated that 85% of users' natural mixed input could be correctly classified as either unimodal or multimodal, and 82% of users' mulitmodal input could be correctly classified as either sequentially or simultaneously integrated.

This is achieved with an accurate morpho-syntactic analyzer that works simultaneously as language detector, followed by a phonological component which performs various phonological transformations. The result of these symbol processing steps is a complete phonological description of the speech to be synthesized. The subsequent processing step, i.e. prosody control, has to generate numerical values for the physical prosodic parameters from this description, a task that is very different from the former ones. This article shows appropriate solutions to both types of tasks, namely a particular rule-based approach for the phonological component and a statistical or machine learning approach to prosody control.

Four components of the model are defined, and several machine learning techniques are used to extract features from dialogue transcripts: maximum entropy classifiers for dialogue acts, latent semantic analysis for topic segmentation, or decision tree classifiers for discourse markers. A rule-based approach is proposed for solving cross-modal references to meeting documents. The methods are trained and evaluated thanks to a common data set and annotation format. The integration of the components into an automated shallow dialogue parser opens the way to multimodal meeting processing and retrieval applications.

Yet, many low-cost complex computer controlled systems are mass-produced without the concurrent provision of precise physics based models. We wish to utilize new developments in machine learning coupled with model based reasoning methods to address this deficiency. In particular, we shall demonstrate that for an important class of these systems, the extremely large number of mass produced, complex engine systems which power vehicles and small power generation plants, effective means of providing MBR for condition based maintenance exists. It will be recognized that the methodology also has much broader applicability. We will show that a class of dynamic neural networks can be used to provide high-fidelity models of these complex systems that permit an analysis of differences between predicted normal behavior and actual plant behavior to be analyzed to detect deviations from nominal behavior which will be shown to be valuable in estimating time-to-failure for such systems. The realization of this capability is dependent upon the development of extremely efficient and powerful training algorithms for these dynamics neural networks. While many simple training schemes have been in use for many years, they generally fail to provide the needed model accuracy when they are applied to training the relatively "large" multi-layered dynamic networks that are needed to precisely mimic plant behavior over all operating conditions. Our approach has several advantages over these simpler, but less effective methods. Three major improvements are the rate at which learning proceeds, the provision of a means to optimize the learning rate through-out the process, and the dramatic improvements observed in learning in the final stages of training when the error feedback from training examples are extremely small and the associated error covariance matrices almost vanish. We shall demonstrate with data drawn from production vehicles, that for several important problems in analyzing system performance in these vehicles, sufficient model fidelity can be attained to meet the requirements on detection efficiency, false alarm immunity and alarm response time which are required for effective diagnostics and prognostics. Finally we shall discuss the manner in which the deviations are analyzed to not only identify that a failure has been detected but also the means by which the probable root cause may be isolated.

The goal of the study was to develop models that could be used to screen large virtual libraries of catalysts in order to suggest candidates for further synthesis and screening. The descriptors used to represent the catalysts did not require detailed information about the catalysts themselves; they could be calculated using only the topology of the ligands. Using an initial set of five descriptors, model accuracies of about 70% were observed from each learning algorithm. A larger descriptor set (with ten descriptors) allowed bag classifiers that were 80% accurate to be built. All models were carefully evaluated to detect overfitting (memorization of the training data) and one example of the effects of overfitting is provided. Because the descriptors used in this study can be calculated very rapidly and the models themselves are very efficient, these bag classifiers are well suited to screening very large virtual libraries.

A morphological representation of the anatomy of interest is first obtained using high-dimensional template warping, from which regions that display strong correlations between morphological measurements and the classification (clinical) variable are extracted using a watershed segmentation, taking into account the regional smoothness of the correlation map which is estimated by a cross-validation strategy in order to achieve robustness to outliers. A Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) technique is then used to rank computed features from the extracted regions, according to their effect on the leave-one-out error bound. Finally, SVM classification is applied using the best set of features, and it is tested using leave-one-out. The results from a group of 61 brain images of female normal controls and schizophrenia patients demonstrate not only high classification accuracy (91.8%) and steep ROC curves, but also exceptional stability with respect to the number of selected features and the SVM kernel size.

In this paper, we contribute a comprehensive framework for spatial and temporal exploration of fMRI data, and apply it to a challenging case study: separating drug addicted subjects from healthy non-drug-using controls. To our knowledge, this is the first time that learning on fMRI data is performed explicitly on temporal information for classification in such applications. Experimental results demonstrate that, by selecting discriminative features, group classification can be successfully performed on our case study although training data are exceptionally high dimensional, sparse and noisy fMRI sequences. The classification performance can be significantly improved by incorporating temporal information into machine learning. Both statistical and neuroscientific validation of the method's generalization ability are provided. We demonstrate that incorporation of computer science principles into functional neuroimaging clinical studies, facilitates deduction about the behavioral probes from the brain activation data, thus providing a valid tool that incorporates objective brain imaging data into clinical classification of psychopathologies and identification of genetic vulnerabilities.

The methods we consider include: support vector machine (SVM), kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD), and committee machines (ensemble averaging and AdaBoost), most of which have been developed recently in statistical learning theory. We formulate differentiation of malignant from benign MCs as a supervised learning problem, and apply these learning methods to develop the classification algorithms. As input, these methods use image features automatically extracted from clustered MCs. We test these methods using a database of 697 clinical mammograms from 386 cases, which include a wide spectrum of difficult-to-classify cases. We use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate and compare the classification performance by the different methods. In addition, we also investigate how to combine information from multiple-view mammograms of the same case so that the best decision can be made by a classifier. In our experiments, the kernel-based methods (i.e., SVM, KFD) yield the best performance, significantly outperforming a well-established CADx approach based on neural network learning.

Currently, the method of choice for the early detection of breast cancer is mammography. While sensitive to the detection of breast cancer, its positive predictive value (PPV) is low, resulting in biopsies that are only 15-34% likely to reveal malignancy. This paper explores the use of two novel approaches called Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Kernel-PLS (K-PLS) to the diagnosis of breast cancer. The approach is based on optimization for the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm for linear regression and the K-PLS algorithm for non-linear regression. Preliminary results show that both the PLS and K-PLS paradigms achieved comparable results with three separate support vector learning machines (SVLMs), where these SVLMs were known to have been trained to a global minimum. That is, the average performance of the three separate SVLMs were Az = 0.9167927, with an average partial Az (Az90) = 0.5684283. These results compare favorably with the K-PLS paradigm, which obtained an Az = 0.907 and partial Az = 0.6123. The PLS paradigm provided comparable results. Secondly, both the K-PLS and PLS paradigms out performed the ANN in that the Az index improved by about 14% (Az congruent to 0.907 compared to the ANN Az of congruent to 0.8). The "Press R squared" value for the PLS and K-PLS machine learning algorithms were 0.89 and 0.9, respectively, which is in good agreement with the other MOP values.

Accurate detection of MC clusters is an important but challenging problem. In this paper, we propose the use of a recently developed machine learning technique - relevance vector machine (RVM) - for automatic detection of MCs in digitized mammograms. RVM is based on Bayesian estimation theory, and as a feature it can yield a decision function that depends on only a very small number of so-called relevance vectors. We formulate MC detection as a supervised-learning problem, and use RVM to classify if an MC object is present or not at each location in a mammogram image. MC clusters are then identified by grouping the detected MC objects. The proposed method is tested using a database of 141 clinical mammograms. and compared with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier which we developed previously. The detection performance is evaluated using the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves. It is demonstrated that the RVM classifier matches closely with the SVM classifier in detection performance., and does so with a much sparser kernel representation than the SVM classifier. Consequently, the RVM classifier greatly reduces the computational complexity, making it more suitable for real-time processing of MC clusters in mammograms.

Classifying learning resources according to domain specific concept hierarchies could address the problem of indexing and reusability. Manual classification is a tedious task and, as a result, automatic classifiers are in high demand. For this task we present an automated approach based on machine learning technique to exploit hierarchal knowledge in order to classify learning resources in a given hierarchy of concepts. We show by experimentation that using hierarchical information and content of unclassified documents provides better accuracy.

However, one major step towards individualized therapy is to use a combination of various data sources, e.g. transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data. We have integrated clinical data and lung cancer microarray data that were generated on two different oligonucleotide platforms. We were interested in the question whether the prediction of survival outcome benefits from the integration of clinical and transcriptomic data. In addition, we attempted to identify those genes whose expression profiles correlate with survival outcome. We applied five machine learning techniques to predict survival risk groups, and we compared the models with respect to their performance and general user acceptance. Based on quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria, we chose decision trees as the most relevant technique for this type of analysis. Our in silico analysis corroborates the role of numerous marker genes already described in lung adenocarcinomas. In addition, our study reveals a set of highly interesting genes whose expression profiles correlate with genetic risk groups of unexpected survival outcomes.

Fuzzeval, our proposed mechanism, consists of a fuzzy controller that dynamically evaluates the perceived strength of the board configurations it receives. Fuzzeval employs an evaluation function that adjusts the membership functions linked to the linguistic variables employed in the knowledge base. The membership functions are aligned to the average crisp input that was successfully used in the past winning games. Fuzzeval mechanisms are adaptive and have the simplicity associated with fuzzy controllers. Our experiments show that Fuzzeval improves its performance up to 42% after a match of only one hundred backgammon games played against Pubeval, a strong intermediate level program.

Although these errors are most commonly attributed to random noise, there also exist "ill-defined" attributes that are too general or too specific that can produce systematic classification errors. We present a computer program called Newton which uses the fact that ill-defined attributes create an ordered error pattern among the instances to compute hypotheses explaining the classification errors of a concept in terms of too general or too specific attributes. Extensive empirical testing shows that Newton identifies such attributes with a prediction rate over 95%.

Our work is based on a residual generation scheme, where the output of a model for process normal behavior is compared against actual process values. The residuals indicate the presence of a fault. The model consists of a general statistical inference Engine operating on discrete spaces. This model represents the maximum entropy joint probability mass function (pmf) consistent with arbitrary lower order probabilities. The joint pmf is a rich model that, once learned, allows one to address inference tasks, which can be used for prediction applications. In our case the model allows the one step-ahead prediction of process variable, given its past values. The relevant past values for the forecast model are selected by learning a causal structure with an algorithm to learn a discrete bayesian network. The parameters of the statistical engine are found by an approximate method proposed by Yan and Miller. We show the performance of the prediction models and their application in power systems fault detection.

Machine learning is used in this case not only as a classifier to decide when a rule is used but to generate meaningful rules which then can be used to syllabify new words. Syllabification is an important task in speech recognition and synthesis since every syllable represents the sound in a single effort of articulation. Experiments were carried out using an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) tool. The experiments were made on different sets of words to ascertain the importance of the number of examples in obtaining useful rules. The results show that it is possible to automatically obtain rules for syllabifying.

This voice is compatible with the Text to Speech Synthesis System Festival. In the development of each module of the system the own features of Spanish were taken into account. In this work we hope to enhance the naturalness of the synthesized voice by including a prosodic model. The prosodic factors taken into consideration by the model are: phrasing, accentuation, duration and F0 contour. Duration and F0 prediction models were trained from natural speech corpora. We found the best prediction models by testing several machine learning methods and two different corpora. The paper describes the building, and training process as well as the results and their respective interpretation.

In practice, some dental implants do not succeed. Important questions in this regard concern whether machine learning techniques could be used to predict whether an implant will be successful and which are the best techniques for this problem. This paper presents a comparative study on machine learning techniques for prediction of success of dental implants. The techniques compared here are: (a) constructive RBF neural networks (RBF-DDA), (b) support vector machines (SVM), (c) k nearest neighbors (kNN), and (d) a recently proposed technique, called NNSRM, which is based on kNN and the principle of structural risk minimization. We present a number of simulations using real-world data. The simulations were carried out using 10-fold cross-validation and the results show that the methods achieve comparable performance, yet NNSRM and RBF-DDA produced smaller classifiers.

A dexterous end effector has to be able of dynamic adaptation to novel and unforeseen situation. Thus, it is vital that gripper controller is able to learn from its perception and experience of the environment. An attractive approach to solve this problem is intelligent control, which is a collection of complementary 'soft computing' techniques within a framework of machine learning. Several attempts have been made to combine methodologies to provide a better framework for intelligent control, of which the most successful has probably been that of neurofuzzy modelling. Here, a neurofuzzy controller is trained using the actor-critic method. Further, an expert system is attached to the neurofuzzy system in order to provide the reward signal and failure signal. Results show that the proposed framework permits a transparent-robust control of a robotic end effector.

Infrastructures and algorithms for distributed anomaly-based intrusion detection in mobile ad-hoc networks	MILCOM 2005 - 2005 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Military Communications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM 2005)	OCT, 2005	Atlantic City, NJ	IEEE			NOVELTY DETECTION	This paper addresses one aspect of the problem of defending Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) against computer attacks, namely, the development of a distributed anomaly-based intrusion detection system. In a general sense, the proposed system is a co-located sensor network, in which the monitored variable is the health of the network being monitored. A three level hierarchical system for data collection, processing and transmission is described. Local IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) are attached to each node of the MANET collecting raw data of network operation, and computing a local anomaly index measuring the difference between the current node operation and a baseline of normal operation. Anomaly indexes from. nodes belonging to a cluster are periodically transmitted to a cluster head, which fuses the node indexes producing a cluster-level anomaly index. Likewise, cluster heads periodically transmit these cluster-level anomaly indexes to a manager node, which fuses the cluster-level indexes into a network-level anomaly index. Due to network mobility, cluster membership and cluster heads are time varying. The paper describes: (1) Clustering algorithms to update cluster centers; (2) Machine Learning algorithms for computing the local anomaly indexes; (3) A statistical scheme for fusing the anomaly indexes at the cluster heads and at the manager The statistical scheme is formally shown to increase detection accuracy under idealized assumptions. These algorithms were implemented and tested under the following conditions. Routing schemes: AODV (Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing) and OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing); Mobility patterns: Random Walk Mobility Model and Reference Point Group Mobility, at various speeds; Types of attacks: Traffic flooding Denial-of-Service and Black Hole. For Performance Evaluation we determined the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) for various operational conditions at the nodes, cluster heads and manager The overall results confirm the effectiveness of the infrastructures and algorithms described in the paper, with detection accuracy generally improving as we move up in the hierarchy, i.e. detection accuracy at the cluster level is higher than at local level, while network-level detection outperforms cluster-level detection.

An Application into Using Artificial Intelligence for Estimating Organic Carbon	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Organic carbon; Artificial neural networks; Artificial intelligence	GREAT-PLAINS	Soil is an important resource that is vital for the sustainability of plants, animals and humans. Organic Carbon is an important soil property that describes the amount of carbon broken down from plants or life forms to the soil below. Traditionally to quantify soils organic carbon content, a soil sample is collected and analysed in a laboratory. The collection of the soil sample is a time consuming and expensive process. A promising alternative is to estimate organic carbon based solely upon remotely sensed data. The advantage of using remotely sensed data is that organic carbon can be estimated without going out into the field. Researchers have investigated the association between organic carbon and climatic factors as well as soil site attributes. Factors such as precipitation, temperature, clay content and soil texture have been found to relate to organic carbon content. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and statistical techniques have been successfully used in various soil studies. Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Trees are examples of AI techniques that have been applied to many prediction and classification problems. These AI approaches use a supervised learning approach, that uses historical data to determine the relationship between the influencing factors (e. g. rainfall, elevation), and the output (e. g. organic carbon). Once trained, these techniques can be applied to previously unseen input data and used to produce an estimate of organic carbon content. Victorian soil data was provided by the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) to assist in the machine learning process. The factors provided in each set are climatic (i.e. rainfall, temperature and evaporation), landform (i.e. elevation and slope) and soil physical and chemical attributes (i.e. pH, sand, silt and clay). From the DPI dataset two datasets were produced. The first dataset (Vic-All) contained all factors related to the presence of organic carbon. The second dataset (Vic-Remote) contained landscape data predominantly derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) as well as climatic data. The first dataset was used to determine if chemical analysis of soil samples could be replaced by using soil survey and automated factors to estimate organic carbon. The second dataset was used to investigate the potential of organic carbon mapping only using remotely sensed factors. Experiments have been undertaken using Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks and Multiple Linear Regression. Models were developed using Artificial Neural Networks and Multiple Linear Regression to predict the percentage of organic carbon in the topsoil. Neural Networks out performed Multiple Linear Regression when predicting the percentage of organic carbon. Correlations of 0.82 and 0.59 were obtained on the Vic-All and Vic-Remote testing datasets using Neural Networks. A classification study was also undertaken, using Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks, to determine how well each model could classify organic carbon into classes (i.e. Low, Moderate or High). Neural Networks showed better performance compared to Decision Trees on three of the four experiments. Testing performances of 80.2% and 62.3% were achieved on the Vic-All and Vic-Remote datasets respectively when classifying to three classes. The results indicate that Neural Networks have promise to be a cost effective method of estimating organic carbon. In particular, the use of Neural Networks combined with remotely sensed data has the potential to make it feasible to map organic carbon over broader areas with limited soil analytical data. Potential research extensions are discussed, including possible directions for developing enhanced models for improving performance, and demonstrating the applicability of the model to broader data sets.

Machine Learning for Adversarial Agent Microworlds	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Wargames; Reinforcement learning; Hierarchy; Representation		We describe models and algorithms to support interactive decision making for operational national and military strategic courses of action. Abstract representations or 'microworlds' have been used throughout military history to aid in conceptualization and reasoning of terrain, force disposition and movements. With the introduction of digitized systems into military headquarters the capacity to degrade decision-making has become a concern with these representations. Maps with overlays are a centerpiece of most military headquarters and may attain an authority which exceeds their competency, as humans forget their limitations both as a model of the physical environment, and as a means to convey command intent (Miller 2005). The design of microworlds may help to alleviate human-system integration problems, by providing detail where and when it is appropriate and recognizable abstractions where it is not. Ultimately, Lambert and Scholz (2005 p. 29) view "the division of labor between people and machines should be developed to leave human decision making unfettered by machine interference when it is likely to prove heroic, and enhance human decision making with automated decision aids, or possibly override it with automated decision making, when it is likely to be hazardous." Cognisant of these issues, we state a formalism for microworlds initially to manage representation complexity for machine learning. This formalism is based on multi-agent stochastic games, abstractions and homomorphism. According to Kaelbling et al (1996), "Reinforcement learning (RL) is the problem faced by an agent that must learn behaviour through trial and error interactions with a dynamic environment." As RL is frustrated by the curse of dimensionality, we have pursued methods to exploit temporal abstraction and hierarchical organisation. As noted by Barto and Mahadevan 2003 (p. 23), " Although the proposed ideas for hierarchical RL appear promising, to date there has been insufficient experience in experimentally testing the effectiveness of these ideas on large applications." We describe the results of RL approaches to microworld applications of progressively increasing complexity, as determined by the state-action space dimension. These include discrete space-time (grid-world) models of modified Chess and Checkers, and a military campaign-level game with concurrent moves, called "TD-Island". We also detail complexity reduction through hierarchical decomposition in a continuous space model of an operational level air-combat model as is shown in figure 1. [GRAPHICS] Given this decomposition, current hierarchical RL approaches are not sufficient in an adversarial context as game-theoretic notions such as mixed or randomised strategies, to keep the opponent "second-guessing" are absent. We briefly describe a new approach to hierarchical learning. This combines both the "win-or-learn-fast" algorithm which learns mixed strategies and the MAXQ algorithm developed to learn through the structure of the hierarchy. Finally, we compare the performance of human guessed parameter importance with that of machine learned importance in a modified game of Checkers with hidden-pieces. Our results show that in new or novel domains, such as the hidden Checkers game, machine-learned parameters fare better in play, as the algorithms can gain experience faster than humans.

A machine learning approach for evaluating the impact of land use and management practices on streamwater pollution by pesticides	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			stream water quality; modeling; simulation; machine learning	AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT; CROP MANAGEMENT; CONSEQUENCES; RUNOFF; SPACE; MODEL; TIME	Streamwater pollution by pesticides is a critical environmental issue in farmed catchment areas. Many important factors are involved in this pollution phenomenon, like weather, area topology, land use and crop management practices, which all influence streamwater quality. The purpose of the ongoing study presented in this paper is to evaluate the impact of land use and management practices on streamwater pollution. We use modelling, simulation and machine learning techniques for acquiring knowledge about this complex domain. Our main objective is to learn qualitative rules relating the pollution factors to the temporal distribution of the stream pesticide concentration. The study area is the farmed catchment of Fremeur (similar to 17 km(2)), located in Brittany, France. Our approach relies on a simulation model, called SACADEAU, which is based on two main components: a biophysical transfer model and a decision model. The biophysical transfer model simulates pesticide transfer through the catchment, from application sites on maize parcels, to the river. The decision model simulates farm management practices such as tillage, sowing, and pesticide application. The two other components of the SACADEAU model include a climate model which provides daily rainfall and temperature, and a spatial model which describes land use and catchment topology ( Figure 1). This simulation model is used for generating a large number of scenarios of the catchment system, considering different weather series or spatial distributions of land use and agricultural activities. [GRAPHICS] Machine learning techniques were used to interpret the very complex and large set of results. ICL, an inductive logic programming software, generated a set of simple rules which described the factors influencing streamwater contamination. This demonstrated that soil characteristics, and in particular organic carbon content, are a key factor controlling contamination. Other important factors are: type of pesticide used, timing and quantity of rainfall, and topology of the catchment. The Sacadeau model is not yet fully implemented and The first results have been obtained with a simplified model. We were able to check the coherence and the feasibility of our approach, and to build a first view of the role of some attributes in stream-water quality. When the SACADEAU model is fully operational, it should be possible to develop more specific rules that incorporate a greater level of details about spatial and temporal variations.	[Cordier, M.

The proposed framework is organized into three views that consider all the stages of a protocol engineering process, i.e. the design, specification, validation, implementation and management of IPs. The modeling view allows visual IP design. The specification view automatically outputs, from the design, the syntactic specification of the IPs in a declarative-type language called ACSL, which improves IP publication, localization and machine learning by agents. Finally, the implementation view provides a formal operational semantics for the ACSL language. This semantics allows protocol property verification and eases automatic code generation from the ACSL specification for the purpose of simulating code execution at design time, as well as improving and assuring correct IP compliance at run time.

In the five editions of MCS workshop, most of the papers have dealt with design methods and applications of supervised multiple classifier systems. Recently, the use of multiple classifier systems has been extended to unsupervised classification tasks. Despite its practical relevance, semi-supervised classification has not received much attention. Few works on semi-supervised multiple classifiers appeared in the machine learning literature. This paper's goal is to review the background results that can be exploited to promote research on semi-supervised multiple classifier systems, and to outline some future research directions.

In contrast, humans learn in changing environments with sequential training examples and leverage prior knowledge in new situations. To deal with real-world problems in changing environments, the ability to make human-like quick responses must be developed in machines. Many researchers have presented learning systems that assume the presence of hidden context and concept drift. In particular, several systems have been proposed that use ensembles of classifiers on sequential chunks of training examples. These systems can respond to gradual changes in large-scale data streams but have problems responding to sudden changes and leveraging prior knowledge of recurring contexts. Moreover, these are not pure online learning systems. We propose an online learning system that uses an ensemble of classifiers suited to recent training examples. We use experiments to show that this system can leverage prior knowledge of recurring contexts and is robust against various noise levels and types of drift.

The need for such methods arises in those sensing application areas in which multiple and diverse sensing modalities are available, but the information provided can be imprecise or only indirectly related to the effects to be discerned. Biological sensing for biodefense is an important instance of such applications. Information fusion in that context is the focus of a research program now underway at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The paper outlines a multi-level, multi-classifier recognition architecture developed within this program, and discusses its components. Information source uncertainty is quantified and exploited for improving the quality of data that constitute the input to the classification processes. Several methods of sensor uncertainty exploitation at the feature-level are proposed and their efficacy is investigated. Other aspects of the program are discussed as well. While the primary focus of the paper is on biodefense, the applicability of concepts and techniques presented here extends to other multisensor fusion application domains.

Not only these methods require high cost for compiling lexico-syntatic patterns but also it is very difficult for human experts to compile a set of lexical-syntactic patterns with a broad-coverage, because in natural languages there are various different expressions which represent the same concept. To alleviate 14 these problems, this paper proposes a new method for extracting hypernyms of a noun from an MRD. In proposed approach, we use only syntactic(part-of-speech) patterns instead of lexico-syntactic patterns in identifying hypernyms to reduce the number of patterns while keeping their coverage broad. Our experiment shows that the classification accuracy of the proposed method is 92.37% which is significantly much better than those of previous approaches.

First we introduce a domain knowledge dictionary NEUKD, and propose two models which use domain knowledge as textual features for text categorization. The first one is BOTW model which uses domain associated terms and conventional words as textual features. The other one is BOF model which uses domain features as textual features. But due to limitation of size of domain knowledge dictionary, we study and use a machine learning technique to solve the problem, and propose a BOL model which could be considered as the extended version of BOF model. In the comparison experiments, we consider naive Bayes system based on BOW model as baseline system. Comparison experimental results of naive Bayes systems based on those four models (BOW, BOTW, BOF and BOL) show that domain knowledge is very useful for improving text categorization. BOTW model performs better than BOW model, and BOL and BOF models perform better than BOW model in small number of features cases. Through learning new features using machine learning technique, BOL model performs better than BOF model.

Provided that enough training data is available, it is possible to learn accurate automatic classifiers by using Information Retrieval and Machine Learning Techniques. However, performance of this approach is damaged by the problems derived from language variation (specially polysemy and synonymy). We investigate how Word Sense Disambiguation can be used to alleviate these problems, by using two traditional methods for thesaurus usage in Information Retrieval, namely Query Expansion and Concept Indexing. These methods are evaluated on the problem of using the Lexical Database WordNet for text categorization, focusing on the Word Sense Disambiguation step involved. Our experiments demonstrate that rather simple dictionary methods, and baseline statistical approaches, can be used to disambiguate words and improve text representation and learning in both Query Expansion and Concept Indexing approaches.

By taking the snapshot instead of the whole, the value space of lexical features can be significantly reduced. From the perspective of machine learning, a small space of feature values implies a loss of information but less data-spareness and less unseen data. The snapshot of words can be taken by using the word folding technique, the goal of which is to reduce the value space of lexical features while minimizing the loss of information.

Compared to the previous perceptron reranking algorithms, the new algorithms use full pairwise samples and allow us to search for margins in a larger space. Our experimental results on the data set of [1] show that a perceptron like ordinal regression algorithm with uneven margins can achieve Recall/Precision of 89.5/90.0 on section 23 of Penn Treebank. Our result on margin selection can be employed in other large margin machine learning algorithms as well as in other NLP tasks.

In this paper, we identify features that influence pronominalization, and construct a pronoun generation model by using various machine learning techniques. The old entities, which are the target of pronominalization, are categorized into three types according to their tendency in attentional state: Cb and old-Cp derived from a Centering model, and the remaining old entities. We construct a pronoun generation model for each type. Eighty-seven texts are gathered from three genres for training and testing. Using this, we verify that our proposed features are well defined to explain pronominalization in Korean, and we also show that our model significantly outperforms previous ones with 99% confidence level by t-test. We also identify central features that have a strong influence on pronominalization across genres.

To resolve the problem of spelling variants, we propose the use of edit-distance as a feature for SVM. To resolve the lack-of-corpus problem, we propose the use of virtual examples, by which the annotated corpus can be automatically expanded in a fast, efficient and easy way. The experimental results show that the introduction of edit-distance produces some improvements. And the model, which is trained with the corpus expanded by virtual examples, outperforms the model trained with the original corpus. Finally, we achieved the high performance of 71.46% in F-measure (64.03% in precision, 80.84% in recall) in the experiment of five categories named entity recognition on CENIA corpus (version 3.0).

Japanese relative clause modification should be classified into at least two major semantic types: case-slot gapping and head restrictive. However, these types for relative clause modification cannot apparently be distinguished. In this paper we propose a method of identifying a RCC's type with a machine learning technique. The features used in our approach are not only representing RCC's characteristics, but also automatically obtained from large corpora. The results we obtained from evaluation revealed that our method outperformed the traditional case frame-based method, and the features that we presented were effective in identifying RCC's types.

In agglutinative languages such as Korean and Japanese, a rule-based chunking method is predominantly used for its simplicity and efficiency. A hybrid of a rule-based and machine learning method was also proposed to handle exceptional cases of the rules. In this paper, we present how CRFs can be applied to the task of chunking in Korean texts. Experiments using the STEP 2000 dataset show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance as well as outperforms previous systems.

An sp-score gives a very concise summary of a review and provides more information than binary classification. The difficulty of this task lies in the quantification of polarity. In this paper we use support vector regression (SVR) to tackle the problem. Experimentson book reviews with five-point scales show that SVR outperforms a multi-class classification method using support vector machines and the results are close to human performance.

The proposed method adopts a machine learning algorithm in acquiring rules for identifying a taxonomic relationship to minimize human-intervention. The accuracy of our method in identifying hypemyms of a noun is 89.7%, and it shows that the proposed method can be successfully applied to the problem of extending a thesaurus.

This research establishes a method for the automatic extraction of such expressions. Our method involves three stages. In the first, a statistical measure is used to extract candidate bi-grams. In the second, we use this list to select occurrences of candidate expressions in a corpus, together with their surrounding contexts. These examples are used as training data for supervised machine learning, resulting in a classifier which can identify target multiword expressions. The final stage is the estimation of the part of speech of each extracted expression based on its context of occurence. Evaluation demonstrated that collocation measures alone are not effective in identifying target expressions. However, when trained on one million examples, the classifier identified target multiword expressions with precision greater than 90%. Part of speech estimation had precision and recall of over 95%.

A wrong order of information not only makes it difficult to understand, but also conveys an entirely different idea to the reader. This paper proposes an algorithm that learns orderings from a set of human ordered texts. Our model consists of a set of ordering experts. Each expert gives its precedence preference between two sentences. We combine these preferences and order sentences. We also propose two new metrics for the evaluation of sentence orderings. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in all evaluation metrics.

This paper presents a two-phase biomedical NER consisting of term boundary detection and semantic labeling. By dividing the problem, we can adopt an effective model for each process. In our study, we use two exponential models, conditional random fields and maximum entropy, at each phase. Moreover, results by this machine learning based model are refined by rule-based postprocessing implemented using a finite state method. Experiments show it achieves the performance of F-score 71.19% on the JNLPBA 2004 shared task of identifying 5 classes of biomedical NEs.

A binary version of the PSO algorithm is used to obtain a set of logic rule's that map binary masks (that represent the attribute values), to the available classes. This algorithm has been tested both in a single pass mode and in an iterated mode on a well-known set of problems, called the MONKS set, to compare the PSO results against the results reported for that domain by the application of some common Machine Learning algorithms.

While swarm systems have proved very effective when applied to a variety of problems, swarm-based methods for computer vision have received little attention. This paper proposes a swarm system capable of extracting and exploiting the geometric properties of objects in images for fast and accurate recognition. In this approach, computational agents move over an image and affix themselves to relevant features, such as edges and corners. The resulting feature profile is then processed by a classification subsystem to categorize the object. The system has been tested with images containing several simple geometric shapes at a variety of noise levels, and evaluated based upon the accuracy of the system's predictions. The swarm system is able to accurately classify shapes even with high image noise levels, proving this approach to object recognition to be robust and reliable.

The bank that has the most accurate view of its credit risk will be the most profitable. One of the main pillars in the assessing credit risk is the estimated probability of default of each counterparty, i.e., the probability that a counterparty cannot meet its payment obligations in the horizon of one year. A credit rating system takes several characteristics of a counterparty as inputs and assigns this counterparty to a rating class. In essence, this system is a classifier whose classes lie on an ordinal scale. In this paper we apply linear regression ordinal logistic regression, and support vector machine techniques to the credit rating problem. The latter technique is a relatively new machine learning technique that was originally designed for the two-class problem. We propose two new techniques that incorporate the ordinal character of the credit rating problem into support vector machines. The results of our newly introduced techniques are promising.

We show that, even when their state space is very large (possibly infinite), natural algorithmic solutions can be implemented in an asynchronous neurocomputing way, that is by an assembly of interconnected simple neuron-like units which does not require any synchronization. From a neuroscience perspective, this work might help understanding how an asynchronous assembly of simple units can give rise to efficient control. From a computational point of view, such neurocomputing architectures can exploit their massively parallel structure and be significantly faster than standard sequential approaches. The contributions of this paper are the following: (1) We introduce a theoretically sound methodology for designing a whole class of asynchronous neurocomputing algorithms. (2) We build an original asynchronous neurocomputing architecture for optimal control in a small state space, then we show how to improve this architecture so that also solves the reinforcement learning problem. (3) Finally, we show how to extend this architecture to address the case where the state space is large (possibly infinite) by using an asynchronous neurocomputing adaptive approximation scheme. We illustrate this approximation scheme on two continuous space control problems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a partially-observable situation, in which the environment includes unobservable state variables, our RL incorporates estimation of unobservable variables. We propose a possible functional model of our RL, focusing on the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. To test the model, we conducted a human imaging study during a sequential learning task, and found significant activations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex during RL. From a comparison of the mean activations in the earlier and later learning phases, we suggest that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex maintains and manipulates the environmental model, while the anterior cingulate cortex is related to the uncertainty of action selection. These experimental results are consistent with our model. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We present here an application of machine learning to adapt simple greedy strategies for the RCPSP. Iterative repair steps are applied to an initial schedule which neglects resource constraints. The rout-algorithm of reinforcement learning is used to learn an appropriate value function which guides the search. We propose three different ways to define the value function and we use the support vector machine (SVM) for its approximation. The specific properties of the SVM allow to reduce the size of the training set and SVM shows very good generalization behavior also after short training. We compare the learned strategies to the initial greedy strategy for different benchmark instances of the RCPSP. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hydrologists use historical data to establish a relationship between water level and discharge, which is known as a rating curve. Once a relationship is established it can be used for predicting discharge from future measurements of water level only. Successful applications of machine learning in water management inspired the exploration of applicability of these approaches in modelling this complex relationship. In the present paper, models of the water level-discharge relationship are built with an artificial neural network (ANN) and an M5 model tree. The relevant inputs are selected by computing average mutual information. The predictive accuracy of this model is compared with a traditional rating curve built with the same data. It is concluded that the ANN- and M5 model tree-based models are Superior in accuracy than the traditional model. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Learning effective and efficient prediction models from such data sets is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a Tabu Search enhanced Markov Blanket (TS/MB) procedure to learn a graphical Markov Blanket classifier from data. The TS/MB procedure is based on the use of restricted neighborhoods in a general Bayesian Network constrained by the Markov condition, called Markov Equivalent Neighborhoods. Computational results from a real world data set drawn from the health care domain indicate that the TS/MB procedure converges fast, is able to find a parsimonious model with substantially fewer predictor variables than in the full data set, has comparable or better prediction performance when compared against several machine learning methods, and provides insight into possible causal relations among the variables.

The basic idea is to characterize the corresponding relations between 2D view feature and 3D model feature based on a machine learning approach. Thus the subsequent feature matching can be carried out in 3D feature space. As an effective solution to regression problems, relevance vector machine is used in this paper to establish an association between 2D and 3D features. Experimental results show that our proposed 2D query based method is comparable with the direct 3D query based one.

There are applications, for example, in pattern recognition, machine learning and information retrieval, where one needs to measure the similarity of objects. When graphs are used for the representation of structured objects, then measuring the similarity of objects becomes equivalent to determining the similarity of graphs. The measurement of similarity is normally performed by determining the maximum common subgraph of the graphs in question.

Since then, numerous developments have been initiated to turn nonlinear oscillators into a standard tool for speech technology. The present contribution will review and compare several of these attempts with a special emphasis on adaptive model identification from data and the approaches to the associated machine learning problems. This includes Bayesian methods for the regularization of the parameter estimation problem (including the pruning of irrelevant parameters) and Ansatz library (Lainscsek et al., 2001) based methods (structure selection of the model). We conclude with the observation that these advanced identification methods need to be combined with a thorough background from speech science to succeed in practical modeling tasks.

As an example, most state of the art automatic speech processing systems rely on a representation based on predefined phonetic symbols. The use of language dependent representations, whilst linguistically intuitive, has several drawbacks i.e. portability across languages, development time. Therefore, in this article, we review and present our recent experiments exploiting the idea inherent in the ALISP (Automatic Language Independent Speech Processing) approach, with particular respect to speech processing, where the intermediate representation between the acoustic and linguistic levels area is automatically inferred from speech data. We then present prospective directions in which the ALISP principles could be exploited by different domains such as audio, speech, text, image and video processing.

The whole segmentation process is subdivided into four steps: series of non-linear transformations are used for building first-order features that allow easy detection of segmentation candidates, second-order features that describe sound properties in the neighborhood of a segmentation candidate are developed, the set of segmentation candidates is transformed into machine learning data set by labeling candidates in accordance to the annotated speech corpus, and supervised symbolic machine learning methods are applied resulting in segmentation rules(1).

J	Gangal, R; Sharma, P				Gangal, R; Sharma, P			Human pol II promoter prediction: time series descriptors and machine learning	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article						Cuticle; cracking; epidermis; fruit growth; Lycopersicon esculentum; plant biomechanics; ripening; stiffening; tomato		Although several in silico promoter prediction methods have been developed to date, they are still limited in predictive performance. The limitations are due to the challenge of selecting appropriate features of promoters that distinguish them from non-promoters and the generalization or predictive ability of the machine-learning algorithms. In this paper we attempt to define a novel approach by using unique descriptors and machine-learning methods for the recognition of eukaryotic polymerase II promoters. In this study, non-linear time series descriptors along with non-linear machine-learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), are used to discriminate between promoter and non-promoter regions. The basic idea here is to use descriptors that do not depend on the primary DNA sequence and provide a clear distinction between promoter and non-promoter regions. The classification model built on a set of 1000 promoter and 1500 non-promoter sequences, showed a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 87% and an independent test set had an accuracy > 85% in both promoter and non-promoter identification. This approach correctly identified all 20 experimentally verified promoters of human chromosome 22. The high sensitivity and selectivity indicates that n-mer frequencies along with non-linear time series descriptors, such as Lyapunov component stability and Tsallis entropy, and supervised machine-learning methods, such as SVMs, can be useful in the identification of pol II promoters.

J	Bhardwaj, N; Langlois, RE; Zhao, GJ; Lu, H				Bhardwaj, N; Langlois, RE; Zhao, GJ; Lu, H			Kernel-based machine learning protocol for predicting DNA-binding proteins	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RECOGNITION; SITES; INTERFACES; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; SEQUENCE; FEATURES; FOLD; CODE	DNA-binding proteins (DNA-BPs) play a pivotal role in various intra- and extra-cellular activities ranging from DNA replication to gene expression control. Attempts have been made to identify DNA-BPs based on their sequence and structural information with moderate accuracy. Here we develop a machine learning protocol for the prediction of DNA-BPs where the classifier is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Information used for classification is derived from characteristics that include surface and overall composition, overall charge and positive potential patches on the protein surface. In total 121 DNA-BPs and 238 non-binding proteins are used to build and evaluate the protocol. In self-consistency, accuracy value of 100% has been achieved. For cross-validation (CV) optimization over entire dataset, we report an accuracy of 90%. Using leave 1-pair holdout evaluation, the accuracy of 86.3% has been achieved. When we restrict the dataset to less than 20% sequence identity amongst the proteins, the holdout accuracy is achieved at 85.8%. Furthermore, seven DNA-BPs with unbounded structures are all correctly predicted. The current performances are better than results published previously. The higher accuracy value achieved here originates from two factors: the ability of the SVM to handle features that demonstrate a wide range of discriminatory power and, a different definition of the positive patch. Since our protocol does not lean on sequence or structural homology, it can be used to identify or predict proteins with DNA-binding function(s) regardless of their homology to the known ones.

Classifying removable images on the Web pages according to their uniqueness of content will allow simpler representation of Web pages. For such classification, machine learning based methods can be used to categorize images into two groups; eliminable and non-eliminable. We use two representative learning methods, the Naive Bayesian classifier and C4.5 decision trees. For our Web image classification, we propose new features that have expressive power for Web images to be classified. We apply image samples to the two classifiers and analyze the results. In addition, we propose an algorithm to construct an optimized subset from a whole feature set, which includes most influential features for the purposes of classification. By using the optimized feature set, the accuracy of classification is found to improve markedly.

Many algorithms for resource management in sensor networks require a comprehensive model of the external environment and the sensor network system, and are rule-based; this restricts their use in dynamic environments. We present an event-based control optimization formulation of the resource management problem and discuss a method to adoptively change desired system performance of the sensor network in response to events. This functionality is critical in field-deployable sensor networks where the available energy is extremely limited. This limitation disallows continuous operation as a very expensive option and necessitates system adaptation as a means to extend operational lifetime in the face of dynamic external events. We show results on synthetic sensor networks where only partially accurate information about the external world and the sensing system is available and illustrate the efficacy of the control algorithm in handling dynamic events with guaranteed minimum system lifespan via efficient usage of energy resources. We show that the control algorithm makes effective control decisions about the use of energy and storage resources with varying sensor reliabilities.

These videos are difficult to analyze, because the airplane moves, the camera zooms in and out and vibrates, and the moving objects of interest can be in the scene, out of the scene, or partly occluded. Recognizing both the moving and static objects is important in order to find events of interest to human analysts. In this paper, we describe our approach to object and event recognition using multiple stages of classification.

Compared with the classical machine learning methods, SVM learning discipline is to minimize the structural risk instead of the empirical risk of the classical methods, and it gives better generative performance. Because SVM algorithm is a convex quadratic optimization problem, the local optimal solution is certainly the global optimal one. In this paper a SVM algorithm is applied to detect the micro-calcifications (MCCs) in mammograms for the diagnostics of breast cancer that has not been reported yet. It had been tested with 10 mammograms and the results show that the algorithm can achieve a higher true positive in comparison with artificial neural network (ANN) based on the empirical risk minimization, and is valuable for further study and application in the clinical engineering.

This is a growing and relatively new type of problem within computer vision. One of the fundamental problems when classifying facial expressions in previous approaches is the lack of a consistent method of measuring expression. This paper solves this problem by the computation of the Facial Expression Shape Model (FESM). This statistical model of facial expression is based on an anatomical analysis of facial expression called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We use the term Action Unit (AU) to describe a movement of one or more muscles of the face and all expressions can be described using the AU's described by FACS. The shape model is calculated by marking the face with 122 landmark points. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyse how the landmark points move with respect to each other and to lower the dimensionality of the problem. Using the FESM in conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVM) we classify facial expressions. SVMs are a powerful machine learning technique based on optimisation theory. This project is largely concerned with statistical models, machine learning techniques and psychological tools used in the classification of facial expression. This holistic approach to expression classification provides a means for a level of interaction with a computer that is a significant step forward in human-computer interaction.

One particular problem in waste disposal and chemical manufacturing is the identification of solvents into chlorinated or non-chlorinated. In this work we have used Raman spectroscopy as the basis for a discrimination and quantification method for chlorinated solvents. Raman spectra of an extensive collection of solvent mixtures (200+) were collected using a JY-Horiba LabRam, infinity with a 488 nm excitation source. The solvent mixtures comprised of several chlorinated solvents: dichloromethane, chloroform, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, mixed with solvents such as toluene, cyclohexane and/or acetone. The spectra were then analysed using a variety of chemometric techniques (Principal Component Analysis and Principal Component Regression) and machine learning (Neural Networks and Genetic Programming). In each case models were developed to identify the presence of chlorinated solvents in mixtures at levels of similar to 5%, to identify the type of chlorinated solvent and then to accurately quantify the amount of chlorinated solvent.

Since participants play different roles on the activeness and success of a VC, it is valuable for companies to treat these participants differently. Considering the situation of large amount of VCs with great population of participant base, companies need some objective and effective methods to distinguish different roles of participants in a VC based on finite online observable behaviors. These roles do not simply mean posting more or less, but rather a compound summary of individual behaviors and social patterns. Integrating with knowledge in social interaction study, such as IPA (Interaction Process Analysis), we apply several quantitative methods, including classification algorithms, clustering algorithms and neural networks, to analyze participants' roles and social influence in VCs. Results demonstrate how those methods can distinguish different groups of participants from individual behaviors and social patterns in VCs. This study also provides a new trial on how advanced information technologies can efficiently understand social factors in VCs with the help of social interaction theories	[Zhang, Cheng; Zhang, Chenghong] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Dept IM & IS, Shanghai, Peoples R China		zhangche@fudan.edu.cn; chzhang@fudan.edu.cn	Zhang, Cheng/A-1230-2009				Bales Robert Freed, 1950, INTERACTION PROCESS; Banyard P., 2000, INTRO PSYCHOL RES 70; BRENNER E, 1998, INFORM TODAY, V15, P16; Carlson Niel, 1997, PSYCHOL SCI BEHAV; FULKERSON B, 1999, HDB ELECT COMMERCE, P411; GRANOVET.MS, 1973, AM J SOCIOL, V78, P1360, DOI 10.1086/225469; HARE AP, 1996, SMALL GROUPS INTRO; Hartigan J.

B	Loh, GH				Loh, GH			A simple divide-and-conquer approach for neural-class branch prediction	PACT 2005: 14th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques	SEP 17-21, 2005	St Louis, MO	IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE TCCA, ACM SIGARCH, IFIP WG 10 3				The continual demand for greater performance and growing concerns about the power consumption in high-performance microprocessors make the branch predictor a critical component of modem microarchitectures. Recent research in applying machine learning techniques to the branch prediction problem has shown incredible improvements in branch prediction accuracy by exploiting correlations in very long branch histories. Nevertheless, these techniques have not been adopted by industry due to the high implementation complexity. In this paper, we propose a global-history Divide-and-Conquer (gDAC) branch predictor that achieves IPC rates that are near that of the best neural predictors, but remains easy to implement because they only make use of simple tables of saturating counters. We show how to use ahead-pipelining to implement our gDAC predictor with a single-cycle effective latency. Our gDAC predictor achieves higher performance (IPC) than the original global history perceptron predictor across all predictor sizes evaluated, and outperforms the path-based neural predictor for predictors 16KB and larger At 128KB, gDAC even achieves an IPC rate equal to the recently proposed piecewise-linear neural branch predictor.

Support vector machines (SVM) have shown strong generalization ability in a number of application areas, including protein structure prediction. However, it is a black box model. On the other hand, a decision tree has good comprehensibility. In this paper, a novel approach to rule generation for understanding protein secondary structure prediction by integrating merits of both support vector machine and decision tree is presented. This approach combines SVM with decision tree into a new algorithm called SVM_DT. The results of the experiments of protein secondary structure prediction on RS126 data sets show that the comprehensibility of SVM_DT is much better than that of SVM. Moreover, the generalization ability of SVM_DT is better than that of decision tree and is similar to that of SVM. Hence, SVM_DT can be used not only for prediction, but also for guiding biological experiments.

Currently such classifications rely on selected packet header fields (e.g. destination port) or application layer protocol decoding. These methods have a number of shortfalls e.g. many applications can use unpredictable port numbers and protocol decoding requires high resource usage or is simply infeasible in case protocols are unknown or encrypted. We propose a framework for application classification using an unsupervised machine learning (ML) technique. Flows are automatically classified based on their statistical characteristics.

Fuzzy ARTMAP systems have been benchmarked against a variety of machine learning, neural networks, and genetic algorithms with considerable success. Owing to many appealing properties, fuzzy ARTMAP systems provide a natural basis for many researchers. Many different approaches have been proposed to modify fuzzy ARTMAP systems. In this paper, we propose a new approach to modifying a fuzzy ARTMAP system. We refer to the new system as the modified and simplified fuzzy ARTMAP (MSFAM) system. The aims of MSFAM systems are not only to reduce the architectural redundancy of the fuzzy ARTMAP system, but also to make extracted rules more comprehensible and concise. Four data sets were used for demonstrating the performance of the proposed MSFAM system.			muchun@csie.ncu.edu.tw; mav@se01.csie.ncu.edu.tw; yjlee@selab.csie.ncu.edu.tw; chen@csie.ncu.edu.tw; echsieh@itl.iii.org.tw					ABE S, 1995, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V3, P18, DOI 10.1109/91.366565; BLUME M, 1996, P WORLD C NEUR NETW, P250; Carpenter G.

Experiments were conducted in the online learning setting to model the way in which time series data is presented. The performance of each learner's probability forecasts was assessed using ROC curves, square loss, classification accuracy and Empirical Reliability Curves (ERC) [1]. Our results demonstrate that effective probability forecasts can be generated on time series data and we discuss the practical implications of this.

In these situations the stability of the given explanation is crucial. We have presented a methodology for building classification trees, Consolidated Trees Construction Algorithm (CTC). CTC is based on subsampling techniques, therefore it is suitable to face class imbalance problems, and it improves the error rate of standard classification trees and has larger structural stability. The built trees are more steady as the number of subsamples used for induction increases, and therefore also the explanation related to the classification is more steady and wider. In this paper a model is presented for estimating the number of subsamples that would be needed to achieve the desired structural convergence level. The values estimated using the model and the real values are very similar, and there are not statistically significant differences.

This paper presents a new rough set based machine learning method, named feature decomposition method, to discover concept hierarchies and develop a multi-hierarchy model of database. For the databases which we are familiar with, the feature group can be selected by experience of expert. When dealing with the databases without any background knowledge, a new criterion based on rough set is presented to select the features to form a feature group. According to some measures of rough set theory, the objects defined on the proposed feature group are labeled by a new intermediate concept. The concept hierarchies of the database have specific meaning, which increased the transparency of data mining process and enhance the comprehensibility of the model. Each feature group and the corresponding intermediate concept compose the structure of the database. Finally rule induction can be processed on the intermediate concepts. The algorithm presented is verified by datasets from UCI. The results show that the multi-hierarchy model established by feature decomposition method can get high classification accuracy and have better comprehensibility.

Research on combination strategies of multiple classifiers becomes a popular topic. For a crisp classifier, which returns a discrete class label instead of a set of real-valued probabilities respecting to every classes, the often used combination method is majority voting. Both majority and weighted majority voting are classifier-based voting schemes, which provide a certain base classifier with an identical confidence in voting. However, each classifier should have different voting priorities with respect to its learning space. This differences can not be reflected by classifier-based voting strategy. In this paper, we propose another two voting strategies in an effort to take such differences into consideration. We apply the AdaBoost algorithm to generate multiple classifiers and vary its voting strategy. Then, the prediction ability of each voting strategy is tested and compared on 8 datasets taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results show that one of the proposed voting strategies, namely sample-based voting scheme, achieves better performance in view of classification accuracy.

In web filtering, content similarity analysis is the core problem, the automatic-learning and relativity-analysis abilities of machine learning algorithms help solve the above problems and make ML useful in web filtering. While in practical applications, different filtering task implies different userinterest and thus implies different filtering result. This work studies how to adjust the web filtering results to be more fit for the user interest. The web filtering result are divided into three categories: relative pages, similar pages and homologous pages according to different user interest. A Biased Support Vector Machine (BSVM) algorithm, which imports a stimulant function, uses training examples distribution n(+)/n(-) and a user-adaptable parameter k to deal imbalancedly different classes of the pre-assigned pages, is introduced to adjust the filtering result to be best fit for the user interest. Experiments show that BSVM can greatly improve the web filtering performance.

One of the contributions is the development of a likelihood function based on one of machine learning algorithm-AdaBoost algorithm. The likelihood function can capture the structure characteristics of one class of objects, and is thus robust to clutters and noise in the complex background. The other contribution is the adoption of mean shift iteration as a proposal distribution, which can steer discrete samples towards regions which most likely contain the targets, and is therefore leading to computational efficiency in the algorithm. The effectiveness of such a framework is demonstrated with a particular class of objects-human faces.

We commence by showing how the problem of converting graphs to strings, or seriation, can be solved using semi-definite programming (SDP). This is a convex optimisation procedure that has recently found widespread use in computer vision for problems including image segmentation and relaxation labelling. We detail the representation needed to cast the graph-seriation problem in a matrix setting so that it can be solved using SDP.

In this work we propose a hierarchical classifier (HQ architecture. Moreover, we show that radial basis function-support vector machines may obtain a lower error rate than linear support vector machines, if a step of feature selection and a step of feature transformation is performed. The error rate decreases from 9.1% using linear support vector machines to 6.85% using the new hierarchical classifier.

Large-scale sequencing, expression and localization data have provided us with a great opportunity to study biology at the system level. I will introduce some outstanding problems in genome expression and regulation network in which better modem statistical and machine learning technologies are desperately needed. Recent revolution in genomics has transformed life science. For the first time in history, mankind has been able to sequence the entire human own genome. Bioinformatics, especially computational molecular biology, has played a vital role in extracting knowledge from vast amount of information generated by the high throughput genomics technologies. Today, I am very happy to deliver this key lecture at the First International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence at the world renowned Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) where such luminaries as Mahalanobis, Bose, Rao and others had worked before. And it is very timely that genomics has attracted new generation of talented young statisticians, reminding us the fact that statistics was essentially conceived from and continuously nurtured by biological problems. Pattern/rule recognition is at the heart of all learning process and hence of all disciplines of sciences, and comparison is the fundamental method: it is the similarities that allow inferring common rules; and it is the differences that allow deriving new rules. Gene expression, normally referring to the cellular processes that lead to protein production, is controlled and regulated at multiple levels. Cells use this elaborate system of "circuits" and "switches" to decide when, where and by how much each gene should be turned on (activated, expressed) or off (repressed, silenced) in response to environmental clues. Genome expression and regulation refer to coordinated expression and regulation of many genes at large-scales for which advanced computational methods become indispensable. Due to space limitations, I can only highlight some of the pattern recognition problems in transcriptional regulation, which is the most important and best studied. Currently, there are two general outstanding problems in transcriptional regulation studies: (1) How to find the regulatory regions, in particular, the promoters regions in the genome (throughout most of this lecture, we use promoter to refer to proximal promoters, e.g. similar to 1kb DNA at the beginning of each gene); (2) How to identify functional cis-regulatory DNA elements within each such region.

This technique aims at exploiting the promising SVM method for classification of 2-D (or n-D) scenes by considering the spatial-context information of the pixel to be analyzed. ne context-based architecture is defined by properly integrating SVMs with a Markov Random Field (MRF) approach. In the design of the resulting system, two main issues have been addressed: i) estimation of the observation term statistic (class-conditional densities) with a proper multiclass SVM architecture; ii) integration of the SVM approach in the framework of MRFs for modeling the prior model of images. Thanks to the effectiveness of the SVM machine learning strategy and to the capability of MRFs to properly model the spatial-contextual information of the scene, the resulting context-sensitive image classification procedure generates regularized classification maps characterized by a high accuracy. Experimental results obtained on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Here, a fuzzy membership value is assigned to each pattern, and points are classified by assigning them to the nearest of two non parallel planes that are close to their respective classes. The algorithm is simple as the solution requires solving a generalized eigenvalue problem as compared to SVMs, where the classifier is obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem. The approach can be used to obtain an improved classification when one has an estimate of the fuzziness of samples in either class.

Its severe assumption that each feature word is independent with other feature words in a document makes higher efficiency possible but also adversely affects the quality of its results because some of feat,ire words are interrelated In this paper, in order to enhance the performance of the text classification, some solutions are proposed to some of the problems with Naive Bayes classifiers. Based on the original Naive Bayes algorithm, we take feature weight into account and make it a factor and combine KL-divergence (relative entropy) between the words to improve Naive Bayes classifier. The improved Naive Bayes classification algorithm is called INBA. By theory and experiment analyses it is proved that INBA algorithm not only has advantages of Naive Bayes classifier, but also results in higher classification accuracy, ana the solutions are feasible, practical and effective.

The resulting FINN lends itself to interpretation of the system obtained, unlike crisp neural nets. Although FINNs have advantages over crisp neural nets and other types of fuzzy inference systems, their creation and optimization processes suffer front disadvantages. FINNs are sensitive to the order of the examples in the training set and require intense computation. This paper details a genetic algorithm, which alleviates the stated disadvantages. In addition, with the purpose of speed up, a parallel implementation of the algorithm is described. The results of using the parallel implementation of the algorithm for three machine learning benchmark problems are presented. Finally, some conclusions and new lines research are proposed.

Key improvements over existing approaches include discovery of "motif hubs" (multiple overlapping significant subgraphs), computational efficiency relative to subgraph census, and flexibility (the method is easily generalizable to weighted and signed graphs). The embedding space is based on scalars, functionals of the adjacency matrix representing the network. Scalars are global, involving all nodes; although they can be related to subgraph enumeration, there is not a one-to-one mapping between scalars and subgraphs. Improvements in network randomization and significance testing-we learn the distribution rather than assuming Gaussianity-are also presented. The resulting algorithm establishes a systematic approach to the identification of the most significant scalars and suggests machine-learning techniques for network classification.

S	Oh, J; Smith, SF		Burke, E; Trick, M		Oh, J; Smith, SF			Learning user preferences in distributed calendar scheduling	PRACTICE AND THEORY OF AUTOMATED TIMETABLING V	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling	AUG 18-20, 2004	Pittsburgh, PA					Within the field of software agents, there has been increasing interest in automating the process of calendar scheduling in recent years. Calendar (or meeting) scheduling is an example of a timetabling domain that is most naturally formulated and solved as a continuous, distributed problem. Fundamentally, it involves reconciliation of a given user's scheduling preferences with those of others that the user needs to meet with, and hence techniques for eliciting and reasoning about a user's preferences are crucial to finding good solutions. In this paper, we present work aimed at learning a user's time preference for scheduling a meeting. We adopt a passive machine learning approach that observes the user engaging in a series of meeting scheduling episodes with other meeting participants and infers the user's true preference model from accumulated data. After describing our basic modeling assumptions and approach to learning user preferences, we report the results obtained in an initial set of proof of principle experiments. In these experiments, we use a set of automated CMRADAR calendar scheduling agents to simulate meeting scheduling among a set of users, and use information generated during these interactions as training data for each user's learner. The learned model of a given user is then evaluated with respect to how well it satisfies that user's true preference model on a separate set of meeting scheduling tasks. The results show that each learned model is statistically indistinguishable from the true model in their performance with strong confidence, and that the learned model is also significantly better than a random choice model.

With the feature representation as input, we compare the performance of several machine learning techniques for misuse detection and show experimental results on anomaly detection. The results show that standard machine learning and clustering techniques on simple "bag of system calls" representation of system call sequences is effective and often performs better than those approaches that use foreign contiguous subsequences in detecting intrusive behaviors of compromised processes.

It is not easy, however, to distinguish such new attacks using only knowledge of pre-existing attacks. In this paper we concentrate on machine learning techniques for detecting attacks from internet anomalies. Our machine learning framework consists of two major components: Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for packet classification. By experiment we also demonstrate that our proposed framework out performs currently employed real-world NIDS.

The approach characterizes network traffic using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set Of counters using bit-pattern hash functions. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. Preliminary results using the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Sets yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with very low false positive rate. Furthermore, the approach is able to detect nearly all of the individual packets that comprised each attack.

Existing statistical and machine learning methods are incapable of dealing with. the complex nonlinear time series prediction. The proposed method combines the wavelet decomposition with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to construct a nonlinear prediction model. The wavelet decomposition is used as a pair of filters to decompose the original time series. A new time series with multiple scales is constructed that is easier to model and predict. The phase space is reconstructed with different time-delay embedding dimension and SVM is performed to construct nonlinear regression prediction model for signal at each scale. The prediction value of each model is summed as the output. The model is established and applied to the ShangHai stock market prediction. Experimental result indicates its superiority over classical Artificial. Neural Network (ANN) and SVM prediction model. It has higher prediction accuracy and is applicable to complex nonlinear time series.

Generally proposed methodology is fit for extracting the differences between HTML documents of web pages, results of which cannot be used to tell the actual distance, between the content of web pages and the facade displayed in internet explorers. Based on these above, content distance, style distance, and hybrid distance are proposed in this paper, to make measurement result more practical. The efficiency will be proved through some classical experiments.

In this paper, we introduce the information theory, propose a new concept of probability information distance (PID) and prove that the PID satisfies four requests of axiomatization of the distance. So the PID is a kind of distance measure, which can be used to measure the degree of variation between two random variables. We make the PID be separability criterion of the classes for information feature extraction, and call it PID criterion (PIDC). Based on PIDC, we design a novel algorithm for information feature xtraction. Compared with principal components analysis (PCA), correlation analysis etc., the algorithm put forward in this paper had regarded for the class information, and so it is a kind of supervised algorithm of feature extraction. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is valid and reliable, and it provides a new research approach for feature extraction, data mining and pattern recognition.
