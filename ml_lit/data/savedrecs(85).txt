J	Eiter, T; Mannila, H				Eiter, T; Mannila, H			Distance measures for point sets and their computation	ACTA INFORMATICA			English	Article								We consider the problem of measuring the similarity or distance between two finite sets of points in a metric space, and computing the measure. This problem has applications in, e.g., computational geometry, philosophy of science, updating or changing theories, and machine learning. We review some of the distance functions proposed in the literature, among them the minimum distance link measure, the surjection measure, and the fair surjection measure, and supply polynomial time algorithms for the computation of these measures. Furthermore, we introduce the minimum link measure, a new distance function which is more appealing than the other distance functions mentioned. We also present a polynomial time algorithm for computing this new measure. We further address the issue of defining a metric on point sets. We present the metric infimum method that constructs a metric from any distance functions on point sets. In particular, the metric infimum of the minimum link measure is a quite intuitive. The computation of this measure is shown to be in NP for a broad class of instances; it is NP-hard for a natural problem class.

J	Ram, A; Santamaria, JC				Ram, A; Santamaria, JC			Continuous case-based reasoning	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						case-based reasoning; machine learning; reinforcement learning; robot navigation; reactive control; motor schema-based navigation	MOBILE ROBOT NAVIGATION; AI RESEARCH; SYSTEM	Case-based reasoning systems have traditionally been used to perform high-level reasoning in problem domains that can be adequately described using discrete, symbolic representations. However, many real-world problem domains, such as autonomous robotic navigation, are better characterized using continuous representations. Such problem domains also require continuous performance, such as on-line sensorimotor interaction with the environment, and continuous adaptation and learning during the performance task. This article introduces a new method for continuous case-based reasoning, and discusses its application to the dynamic selection, modification, and acquisition of robot behaviors in an autonomous navigation system, SINS (self-improving navigation system). The computer program and the underlying method are systematically evaluated through statistical analysis of results from several empirical studies. The article concludes with a general discussion of case-based reasoning issues addressed by this research.

The eight models were each constructed based on 9847 patient cases and they were each evaluated on 4352 additional cases. The primary evaluation metric was the error in predicted survival as a function of the fraction of patients predicted to survive. This metric is useful in assessing a model's potential to assist a clinician in deciding whether to treat. a given patient in the hospital or at home. We examined the error rates of the models when predicting that a given fraction of patients will survive. We examined survival fractions between 0.1 and 0.6. Over this range, each model's predictive error rate was within 1% of the error rate of every other model. When predicting that approximately 30% of the patients will survive, all the models have an error rate of less than 1.5%. The models are distinguished more by the number of variables and parameters that they contain than by their error rates; these differences suggest which models may be the most amenable to future implementation as paper-based guidelines.

J	Domingos, P				Domingos, P			Context-sensitive feature selection for lazy learners	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						lazy learning; feature selection; nearest neighbor; induction; machine learning	RULES	High sensitivity to irrelevant features is arguably the main shortcoming of simple lazy learners. In response to it, many feature selection methods have been proposed, including forward sequential selection (FSS) and backward sequential selection (BSS). Although they often produce substantial improvements in accuracy, these methods select the same set of relevant features everywhere in the instance space, and thus represent only a partial solution to the problem. In general, some features will be relevant only in some parts of the space; deleting them may hurt accuracy in those parts, but selecting them will have the same effect in parts where they are irrelevant. This article introduces RC, a new feature selection algorithm that uses a clustering-like approach to select sets of locally relevant features (i.e., the features it selects may vary from one instance to another). Experiments in a large number of domains from the UCI repository show that RC almost always improves accuracy with respect to FSS and BSS, often with high significance, A study using artificial domains confirms the hypothesis that this difference in performance is due to RC's context sensitivity, and also suggests conditions where this sensitivity will and will not be an advantage. Another feature of RC is that it is faster than FSS and BSS, often by an order of magnitude or more.

J	Sheppard, JW; Salzberg, SL				Sheppard, JW; Salzberg, SL			A teaching strategy for memory-based control	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						lazy learning; nearest neighbor; genetic algorithms; differential games; pursuit games; teaching; reinforcement learning	REINFORCEMENT	Combining different machine learning algorithms in the same system can produce benefits above and beyond what either method could achieve alone. This paper demonstrates that genetic algorithms can be used in conjunction with lazy learning to solve examples of a difficult class of delayed reinforcement learning problems better than either method alone. This class, the class of differential games, includes numerous important control problems that arise in robotics, planning, game playing, and other areas, and solutions for differential games suggest solution strategies for the general class of planning and control problems. We conducted a series of experiments applying three learning approaches - lazy Q-learning, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and a genetic algorithm - to a particular differential game called a pursuit game. Our experiments demonstrate that Ic-NN had great difficulty solving the problem, while a lazy version of Q-learning performed moderately well and the genetic algorithm performed even better. These results motivated the next step in the experiments, where we hypothesized Ic-NN was having difficulty because it did not have good examples - a common source of difficulty for lazy learning. Therefore, we used the genetic algorithm as a bootstrapping method for Ic-NN to create a system to provide these examples. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting joint system learned to solve the pursuit games with a high degree of accuracy outperforming either method alone - and with relatively small memory requirements.

By making use of machine learning techniques the features of the surface froths of flotation cells can be used to construct representations of the behaviour of a plant. Two probabilistic decision tree methods and a backpropagation neural net were all equally capable of classifying the different froths at least as well as a human expert. Explicit decision trees were derived, relating froth characteristics to froth surface structures. Relatively sharply clustered Sammon maps of froth structures were obtained, allowing good visualisation of multidimensional flotation data.

Data analysis with rule induction	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						artificial intelligence; data analysis; ecological modelling; expert systems; machine learning; rule induction		Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods can be used to automate the acquisition of ecological knowledge, i.e., automate the construction of ecological models. This paper describes a particular methodology of machine learning, called rule induction, and its application to data analysis in several ecological domains. These include the biological classification of British rivers based on bioindicator data, the analysis of the influence of physical and chemical parameters on selected bioindicator organisms in Slovenian rivers and the biological classification of Slovenian rivers based on physical and chemical parameters as well as bioindicator data. In all three cases, valuable models (knowledge) in the form of rules were extracted from data acquired through environmental monitoring and/or expert interpretation of the acquired samples. This provides positive evidence for the utility of machine learning in ecological modelling. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The drawbacks of this approach are mostly related to the knowledge elicitation through laborious enumeration of the tree structure and ad hoc threshold selection for symptoms definition. These problems can be alleviated if a more profound knowledge of the process is brought into play. The main idea of the paper consists of modeling the nominal and faulty states of the plant by means of interval-like component models derived from first-principles laws, e.g. the conservation law. Such a model serves to simulate the entire system under different fault conditions, in order to obtain the representative patterns of measurable process quantities, i.e. training examples. To march these patterns by diagnostic rules, multistrategy machine learning is applied. As a result, binary decision trees that relate symptoms to faults are obtained, along with the thresholds defining the symptoms, This technique is applied to a laboratory test process operating in the steady state, and is shown to be suitable for handling incipient single faults. The proposed learning approach is compared with two related machine learning methods, It is found that it achieves similar classification accuracy with better transparency of the resulting diagnostic system.

J	Chen, CLP; Lu, Y				Chen, CLP; Lu, Y			FUZZ: A fuzzy-based concept formation system that integrates human categorization and numerical clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article							BASIC CATEGORIES; CONSTRUCTION; MODEL	Recently, psychologists proposed the prototype theory of concept representation, in which a concept is organized around a best example or so-called prototype. Most proponents of the prototype theory conceive that objects may fall in a concept to some degree rather than the all-or-none membership in the classical theory, Fuzzy-set theory is compatible with the basic premises of the prototype theory of concept representation, Concept formation is defined as a machine learning task that captures concepts through categorizing the observation of objects and also uses them in classifying future experiences, A reasonable computational model of concept formation must reflect the characteristics of human concept learning and categorization, In this paper, the design and implementation of a fuzzy-set based concept formation system (FUZZ) is presented. The main feature of the FUZZ is that the concept hierarchy is nondisjoint, in which an instance may belong to two categories in different memberships, An information-theoretic evaluation measure called category binding to direct searches in the FUZZ is proposed, The learning and classification algorithms of the FUZZ are also given, In order to examine FUZZ's behavior, the results of some experiments are examined.

It has become clear from these studies that it is important to develop or choose learning procedures appropriate for the types of data models involved in a given problem formulation. In this paper, we focus on this issue of learning with respect to different data structures and consider, in particular, problems related to the learning of relational structures in visual data. Finally, we discuss problems related to rule evaluation in multi-object complex scenes and introduce some new techniques to solve them.

J	Silver, DL; Hurwitz, GA				Silver, DL; Hurwitz, GA			The predictive and explanatory power of inductive decision trees: A comparison with artificial neural network learning as applied to the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						coronary artery disease; artificial intelligence; machine learning; artificial neural networks; inductive decision trees	ACUTE PULMONARY-EMBOLISM; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS; PERFUSION IMAGES; CLINICAL-DATA; EXERCISE; TL-201; SCINTIGRAPHY; IDENTIFICATION; INTELLIGENCE	Background: This paper compares two machine learning systems, an inductive decision tree (IDT) and a back-propagation neural network (ANN), in the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease given a set of diagnostic input attributes, A collection of 490 patient cases were accumulated from the reference of diagnostic stress myocardial scintigraphy performed in a nuclear medicine department. All cases had correlating angiography, the results of which were used to derive the target diagnoses, Input attributes included 4 baseline clinical characteristics, 4 nonimaging stress components, and 3 scintigraphic findings. Methods: We chose 4 possible angiographic criteria for coronary artery disease and assessed the ability of each learning system to develop a diagnostic model, The 2 machine learning systems were compared on the basis of predictive performance and explanatory power. Results: Cross-validation experiments showed the 2 machine learning systems to have equivalent predictive power at the same level as the clinical scan reading, For the 70% stenosis criterion, the IDT had a sensitivity of 94 +/- 3% (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) and a specificity of 59 +/- 8%, and the ANN had a sensitivity of 97 +/- 2% and a specificity of 51 +/- 13%. However the IDT system exhibited excellent explanatory power; producing simple representations of the diagnostic models which agree with previous research. Conclusion: In comparison with the more widely used ANNs, the IDT learning system may bring advantages to certain problems in diagnostic classification.

J	Karalic, A; Bratko, I				Karalic, A; Bratko, I			First order regression	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						machine learning; inductive logic programming; regression; real-valued variables; first-order logic; applications of machine learning		We present a new approach, called First Order Regression (FOR), to handling numerical information in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). FOR is a combination of ILP and numerical regression. First-order logic descriptions are induced to carve out those subspaces that are amenable to numerical regression among real-valued variables. The program FORS is an implementation of this idea, where numerical regression is focused on a distinguished continuous argument of the target predicate. We show that this can be viewed as a generalisation of the usual ILP problem. Applications of FORS On several real-world data sets are described: the prediction of mutagenicity of chemicals, the modelling of liquid dynamics in a surge tank, predicting the roughness in steel grinding, finite element mesh design, and operator's skill reconstruction in electric discharge machining. A comparison of FORS' performance with previous results in these domains indicates that FORS is an effective tool for ILP applications that involve numerical data.

The classification rules are represented in the form of logic programs. We first transform input objects from pixel representation into predicate representation. The transformation consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and symbolic transformation. We then use FOIL which is an indictive logic programming system to produce classification rules. Experiments on two sets of data were performed to justify our proposed method. Copyright (C) 1997 pattern Recognition Society.

The name program-based branch prediction is given to static branch prediction techniques that base their prediction on a program's structure. In this article, we investigate a new approach to program-based branch prediction that uses a body of existing programs to predict the branch behavior in a new program. We call this approach to program-based branch prediction evidence-based static prediction, or ESP. The main idea of ESP is that the behavior of a corpus of programs can be used to infer the behavior of new programs. In this article, we use neural networks and decision trees la map static features associated with each branch to a prediction that the branch will be taken. ESP shows significant advantages over other prediction mechanisms. Specifically, it is a program-based technique; it is effective across a range of programming languages and programming styles; and it does not rely on the use of expert-defined heuristics. In this article, me describe the application of ESP to the problem of static branch prediction and compare our results to existing program-based branch predictors. We also investigate the applicability of ESP across computer architectures, programming languages, compilers, and run-time systems. We provide results showing how sensitive ESP is to the number and type of static features and programs included in the ESP training sets, and we compare the efficacy of static branch prediction for subroutine libraries.

The paper outlines reactive/proactive approaches based on real-time production monitoring, and on the other hand, distributed (agent based) solutions. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques is emphasised. Simulation is an obvious way to develop and test new architectures. For this reason, an object oriented framework for evaluation of new control architectures is shortly introduced.

Several types of structured objects can be represented adequately by labeled graphs. The similarity of such descriptions is difficult to define and to compute. However, many algorithms in machine learning, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition and classification are based on the estimation of the similarity between the analysed objects. In order to make similarity based algorithms like nearest neighbor classifiers, clustering, or generalised prototype learning accessible for the analysis of relational data, a connectionist approach for the determination of the similarity of arbitrary labeled graphs is introduced. Using an example from organic chemistry, it is shown that classifiers based on the connectionist approach to structural similarity to be considered in this paper perform very satisfactorily in comparison with recent logical and feature vector approaches. Moreover, being able to handle relational data in a natural way without any loss of structural information, the algorithms need only a subset of the given features of the objects for classification.

However, little attention is typically given to the validity of the features and types of rules generated by these systems and how well they perform across a variety of features and patterns. A comparison of the classification performance of two different types of decision tree techniques and their associated feature types is presented.

Ltree is able to define decision surfaces both orthogonal and oblique to the axes defined by the attributes of the input space. This is done combining a decision tree with a linear discriminant by means of constructive induction. At each decision node Ltree defines a new instance space by insertion of new attributes that are projections of the. examples that fall at this node over the hyper-planes given by a linear discriminant function. This new instance space is propagated down through the tree. Tests based on those new attributes are oblique with respect to the original input space. Ltree is a probabilistic tree in the sense that it outputs a class probability distribution for each query example. The class probability distribution is computed at learning time, taking into account the different class distributions on the path from the root to the actual node. We have carried out experiments on sixteen benchmark datasets and compared our system with other well known decision-tree systems (orthogonal and oblique) like C4.5, OC1 and LMDT. On these datasets we have observed that our system has advantages in what concerns accuracy and tree size at statistically significant confidence levels.

S	Schlosser, M		Liu, XH; Cohen, P; Berthold, M		Schlosser, M			Knowledge discovery in endgame databases	ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS: REASONING ABOUT DATA	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Advances in Intelligent Data Analysis - Reasoning About Data (IDA-97)	AUG 04-06, 1997	LONDON, ENGLAND					In many application domains we have seen an explosive growth in the capabilities to both generate and collect data. Representative examples are business, medical, and scientific databases. In the game of chess (and similar games), we have a similar situation. Moreover, in chess we have gigantic databases with perfect information available. An endgame database is a very rare case of an information source with complete knowledge. However, this information, although complete, is not in a form which is particularly useful to human beings. Therefore, the raw data inside an endgame database have to be transformed into knowledge in understandable form. This task concerning chess endgame databases is, in principle, the same as in KDD in general. This paper summarizes a few results from literature where knowledge (especially patterns) has been discovered for simple chess endgames - in most cases this has been done empirically, by intuition, and interacting with the computer, but not automatically. Up to now, there are almost no satisfying results for practical endgames to extract knowledge in an automatic way. The main contribution of this paper is to present a new chess endgame database from which we have extracted knowledge automatically using decision trees - a method well-known from Machine Learning. Additionally, a mechanism for automatic feature discovery is introduced.

Instead we apply simple hill-climbing in a relative fitness environment. These results and further analysis suggest that the surprising success of Tesauro's program had more to do with the co-evolutionary structure of the learning task and the dynamics of the backgammon game itself.

J	Holsapple, CW; Lee, A; Otto, J				Holsapple, CW; Lee, A; Otto, J			A machine learning method for multi-expert decision support	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article								When a decision maker has access to multiple expert systems, each embodying a different expert perspective on analyzing and reasoning about the same bind of decision problem, an important consideration is which to use at what times. We address this issue with a method based on competition among the distinct expert systems (and their respective rules). We begin by reviewing prior research concerned with the coordination of multiple sources of expertise in support of decision making, pointing out potential weaknesses of the proposed methods. Next, we introduce a new coordination method based on the competitive paradigm that has been applied in machine learning. This method involves adjustments to the strengths of expert systems and to their constituent rules based on their performances. A nine-step process for adjusting strengths is described. Advantages and limitations of this new method for expert system coordination are discussed. We outline an approach to testing the coordination method and report on preliminary testing of the performance of a system employing our method versus the performance of individual experts.

Some systems employ machine learning techniques to allow the agent to adapt to the user's changing requirements. With the increase in the volume of data on the Internet, agents have emerged that are able to monitor and learn from their users to identify topics of interest. One such agent, described here, has been developed to filter mail messages. We examine the issues involved in constructing an autonomous interface agent that employs a learning component, and explore the use of two different learning techniques in this content.

J	Kononenko, I; Simec, E; RobnikSikonja, M				Kononenko, I; Simec, E; RobnikSikonja, M			Overcoming the myopia of inductive learning algorithms with RELIEFF	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						learning from examples; estimating attributes; impurity function; RELIEFF; empirical evaluation		Current inductive machine learning algorithms typically use greedy search with limited lookahead. This prevents them to detect significant conditional dependencies between the attributes that describe training objects. Instead of myopic impurity functions and lookahead, we propose to use RELIEFF an extension of RELIEF developed by Kira and Rendell [10, 11], for heuristic guidance of inductive learning algorithms. We have reimplemented Assistant, a system for top down induction of decision trees, using RELIEFF as an estimator of attributes at each selection step. The algorithm is tested on several artificial and several real world problems and the results are compared with some other well known machine learning algorithms. Excellent results on artificial data sets and two real world problems show the advantage of the presented approach to inductive learning.

This paper describes and compares three kinds of algorithms that learn axis-parallel rectangles to solve the multiple instance problem. Algorithms that ignore the multiple instance problem perform very poorly. An algorithm that directly confronts the multiple instance problem (by attempting to identify which feature vectors are responsible for the observed classifications) performs best, giving 89% correct predictions on a musk odor prediction task. The paper also illustrates the use of artificial data to debug and compare these algorithms.

J	DeJong, GF; Bennett, SW				DeJong, GF; Bennett, SW			Permissive planning: Extending classical planning to uncertain task domains	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						planning; learning; uncertainty; machine learning; explanation-based learning; planning bias	GOALS	Uncertainty, inherent in most real-world domains, can cause failure of apparently sound classical plans. On the other hand, reasoning with representations that explicitly reflect uncertainty can engender significant, even prohibitive, additional computational costs. This paper contributes a novel approach to planning in uncertain domains, The approach is an extension of classical planning. Machine learning is employed to adjust planner bias in response to execution failures, Thus, the classical planner is conditioned towards producing plans that tend to work when executed in the world. The planner's representations are simple and crisp; uncertainty is represented and reasoned about only during learning. The user-supplied domain theory is left intact. The operator definitions and the planner's projection ability remain as the domain expert intended them. Some structuring of the planner's bias space is required. But with suitable structuring the approach scales well. The learning converges using no more than a polynomial number of examples. The system then probabilistically guarantees that either the plans produced will achieve their goal when executed or that adequate planning is not possible with the domain theory provided. An implemented robotic system is described.

J	Fink, E; Yang, QN				Fink, E; Yang, QN			Automatically selecting and using primary effects in planning: Theory and experiments	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						planning; machine learning; primary effects; partial-order planning; PAC learning		The use of primary effects of operators is an effective approach to improving the efficiency of planning. The characterization of ''good'' primary effects, however, has remained at an informal level and there have been no algorithms for selecting primary effects of operators. We formalize the use of primary effects in planning and present a criterion for selecting useful primary effects, which guarantees efficiency and completeness. We analyze the efficiency of planning with primary effects and the quality of the resulting plans. We then describe a learning algorithm that automatically selects primary effects and demonstrate, both analytically and empirically, that the use of this algorithm significantly reduces planning time and does not compromise completeness.

An important issue for virtual teaching environments is the efficient processing of the students' questions. We have developed a user-friendly question support facility that overcomes many limitations of real classroom situations. We provide the students with a natural language interface so that they can formulate their questions directly in Japanese. The system applies the computed semantic representations to the retrieval of answers from a FAQ knowledge base or to the gathering of semantically equivalent new questions. One of the main obstacles to the efficient use of natural language interfaces is the often required high amount of manual knowledge engineering. Therefore, we support an adaptive interface architecture to automate the acquisition of linguistic knowledge. For that purpose we apply existing linguistic resources and methods from machine learning. We guide the assignment to the correct semantic category by an XSE (eXtended Semantic Enumeration) tree, a powerful model-based machine learning paradigm. It selectively activates linguistic tests from semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic analysis according to the required feature tests during the search of rule nodes. We build the XSE-tree automatically based on past input questions without the need for any additional linguistic knowledge.

Subjects were represented by their age, education and gender, plus their responses on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), and the Ishihara Color Plate (ICP) tasks. The ML algorithms applied to these data contained within the electronic patient records of a medical relational database, learned rule sets that were as good as or better than any rules derived from either the Literature or from domain specific knowledge provided by expert clinicians. All ML algorithms for all runs found that a single question from the FAQ, the forgetting rule, (''Do you require assistance remembering appointments, family occasions, holidays, or taking medications?'') was the only attribute included in all rule sets. CART's tree simplification procedure always found that just the forgetting rule gave the best pruned decision tree rule set with classification accuracy (93% sensitivity and 80% specificity) as high as or better than any other decision tree rule-set. Comparison with published classification accuracies for the FAQ and MMSE revealed that including some of the additional attributes in these tests actually worsen classification accuracy. Stepwise logistic regression using the FAQ attributes to classify dementia status confirmed that the forgetting rule gave a much larger odds ratio than any other attribute and was the only attribute included in all of the stepwise logistic regressions performed on 33 random samples of the data. Stepwise logistic regression using the MMSE attributes identified two attributes which occurred in all 33 runs and had by far the highest odds ratio.

Earlier experiments have demonstrated the utility of background knowledge when learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. A particular form of background knowledge comprising typical co-occurrences of several groups of attributes was provided by a medical expert. This paper explores the possibility to automate the process of acquiring background knowledge of this kind. A method based on function decomposition is proposed that identifies typical co-occurrences for a given set of attributes, The method is evaluated by comparing the typical co-occurrences it identifies, as well as their contribution to the performance of machine learning algorithms, to the ones provided by a medical expert.

Another source of knowledge about a decision making problem are examples of expert decisions in situations that have occurred in practice, stored in patient records of clinical information systems. Such examples can be used to revise the expert-provided knowledge, i.e., to discover and repair its deficiences. The revised knowledge performs better than the original one and often better than rules learned from examples alone. In addition, it inherits pacts of the original expert knowledge and is thus easier to understand and accept for the expert. We present an application of the machine learning approach of theory revision to the problem of revising an expert-provided theory for treating children with acute abdominal pain.

The applied methods include variants of the Assistant algorithm for top-down induction of decision trees, and variants of the Bayesian classifier. Since the available dataset turned out to be insufficent for reliable diagnosis of selected sport injuries, expert-defined diagnostic rules were added and used in combination with classifiers induced by machine learning systems. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy and the explanation capability of the naive Bayesian classifier with the fuzzy discretization of numerical attributes was superior to other methods and therefore the most appropriate for practical use in our application.

The four diagnostic levels consist of evaluation of signs and symptoms of the disease and ECG (electrocardiogram) at rest, sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, myocardial scintigraphy and finally coronary angiography. The diagnostic process is stepwise and the results are interpreted hierarchically, i.e. the next step is necessary only if the results of the former are inconclusive. Because the suggestibility is possible, the results of each step are interpreted individually and only the results of the highest step are valid. On the other hand, Machine Learning methods may be able of objective interpretation of all available results for the same patient and in this way increase the diagnostic accuracy of each step. We conducted many experiments with four learning algorithms and different variations of our dataset (327 patients with completed diagnostic procedures). Our results show that improvements using Machine Learning techniques are reasonable and might find good use in practice.

We have developed CMGTP (Constraint MGTP) to deal with constraint satisfaction problems. By attaining the constraint propagation with negative atoms, CMGTP makes it possible to reduce search spaces by orders of magnitude compared to the original MGTP. To enhance the ability to prune search spaces, we have developed a new method called non-Horn magic sets (NHM) and incorporated its relevancy testing function into the folding-up (FU) method proposed by Letz. The NHM method suppresses useless model generation with clauses irrelevant to the goal. The FU method avoids generating duplicated sub-proofs after case-splitting. With these methods we can eliminate two major kinds of redundancies in model-generation based theorem provers. We have studied several applications in Al such as negation as failure, abductive reasoning and modal logic systems, through extensive use of MGTP. These studies share a basic common idea, that is, to use MGTP as a meta-programming system. We can build various reasoning systems on MGTP by writing the specific inference rules for each system in MGTP input clauses. Furthermore, are are now working on other applications such as machine learning with MGTP and heuristic proof-search based on the genetic algorithm.

In the current study, the self-organizing feature map algorithm, the genetics-based machine learning (GBML) paradigm, and the K-means nearest neighbour clustering algorithm are applied on the same set of data. The aim of this exercise is to show how these three paradigms can be used in practice, given that their diagnostic performance is problem- and parameter-dependent. A total of 720 macro EMG recordings were carried out from four groups, from seven normal, nine motor neuron disease, 14 Becker's muscular dystrophy, and six spinal muscular atrophy subjects, respectively. Twenty-three of the subjects were used for training and 13 for evaluating the various models. For each subject, the mean and the standard deviation of the parameters (i) amplitude, (ii) area, (iii) average power and (iv) duration were extracted. The feature vector was structured in two different ways for input to the models: an eight-input feature vector that consisted of both the mean and the standard deviation of the four parameters measured, and a four-input feature vector that included only the mean of the parameters. Also, due to the heterogenous nature of the spinal muscular atrophy group, three class models that excluded this group were investigated. In general, self-organizing feature map and GBML models resulted in comparable diagnostic performance of the order of 80-90% correct classifications (CCs) score for the evaluation set, whereas the K-means nearest neighbour algorithm models gave lower percentage CCs. Furthermore, for all three learning paradigms: better diagnostic performance was obtained for the three class models compared with the four class models; similar diagnostic performance was obtained for both the eight- and four-input feature vectors. Finally, it is claimed that the proposed methodology followed in this work can be applied for the development of diagnostic systems in the analysis of biosignals.

Situated learning theory postulates that the situations that an expert is exposed to forms the developmental conditions of expertise. We extend and adapt that theory for computer-aided design with the primary objective of learning the use of existing knowledge, rather than simply the knowledge itself. The idea behind situated learning is to learn situations and associate them with some knowledge with the intention of using the knowledge in similar situations.

We are employing machine learning algorithms to classify full-text legal opinions in terms of a set of predefined concepts. These factors, representing factual strengths and weaknesses in the case, are used in the case-based argumentation module of our instructional environment CATO. We first show empirical evidence for the connection between the factor model and the vector representation of texts developed in information retrieval. In a set of hypotheses we sketch how including knowledge about the meaning of the factors, their relations and their use in the case-based reasoning system can improve learning, and discuss in what ways background knowledge about the domain can be beneficial. The paper presents initial experiments that show the limitations of purely inductive algorithms for the task.

In this paper we will address this problem and explain how the domain theory plays a key role in determining the context of a feature. We provide a characterization of the domain theory End show that in domains meeting this characterization, the context can be simplified. We also use explanation-based learning techniques to determine the context in domains not meeting the characterization. Our work relates for the first time CBR, machine learning and planning theory to determine the context of a feature.

Sizing optimization and material selection are also briefly commented. The prominent methods employed to generate optimal topological designs are homogenization, bubble insertion, nature analogy and ground structure. Similarly, the main algorithms used to perform shape optimization fall in one of the following categories: boundary variation, nature analogy and hybrid such as, a machine learning system interfaced to the shape optimization environment. The practical use of such methods in the design of structures is discussed. Special consideration will be given to the nature analogy software algorithms SKO (soft kill option) and CAO (computer aided optimization) both developed at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre. These are an integral part of the software package employed at EMPA for topology and shape optimization, respectively. In addition, it is planned to fabricate and test the structural components optimized with SKO and CAO in order to validate the algorithms.

J	Wu, XD				Wu, XD			Hybrid interpretation of 'no match' and 'multiple match' in induction	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article								When applying rules produced by induction from training examples to a test example, there are three possible cases that demand different actions: (i) no match; (ii) single match; and (iii) multiple match. Existing techniques for dealing with the first and third cases are exclusively based on probability estimation. However, when there are continuous attributes in the example space, and if these attributes have been discretized into intervals before induction, fuzzy interpretation of the discretized intervals at deduction time could be very valuable. This paper describes the fuzzy matching techniques implemented in the HCV (Version 2.0) software, and presents a hybrid interpretation mechanism which combines fuzzy matching with probability estimation. Experimental results of the HCV (Version 2.0) software with different interpretation techniques are provided on a number of data sets from the University of California at Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Databases.

Machine Learning (ML) can use all particular data in interpretation of result. Our goal was to predict in a group of 327 patients the results of coronary angiography obtained by ML method and compare them with the results of MPS as the highest step in the classical diagnostic procedure. The Naive Bayesian Classifier as one of the ML methods was applied. The sensitivity of MPS was 0.83 and specificity 0.85 The post-test probability for CAD was 0.75 for positive results and 0.43 for negative ones. With application of ML we achieved sensitivity 0.89, specificity 0.88 and the post-test probability 0.90 for positive and 0.25 for negative results.

The input to VF15 is a training set of records. Each record contains clinical measurements, from ECG signals and some other information such as set age, and weight, along with the decision of an expert cardiologist. The knowledge representation is based on a recent technique called Feature Intervals, where a concept is represented by the projections of the training cases on each feature separately. Classification in VF15 is based on a majority voting among the class predictions made by each feature separately. The comparison of the VF15 algorithm indicates that it outperforms other standard algorithms such as Naive Bayesian and Nearest Neighbor classifiers.

The model is based on the design of ML systems. It integrates different tools with various purposes in an open environment in order to facilitate the interaction between the ML system and another agent which is often an expert or a user. This integration is done in such a way that every change of data in one of the tools is automatically taken into account and interpreted by the other tools. Such dynamic process improves the interaction with the ML system, and consequently the interpretation of ML results. A prototype of such model is described.

J	Lehnert, WG				Lehnert, WG			Information extraction: What have we learned?	DISCOURSE PROCESSES			English	Article								Practical natural language processing applications typically confront significant difficulties with lexical ambiguity, knowledge-engineering bottlenecks, and brittle processing techniques that fail to handle unrestricted input in a robust fashion. However, recent research efforts suggest that these problems can be successfully negotiated for an important class of applications. Information extraction systems operate in restricted discourse domains where they summarize the content of input texts in a highly goal-oriented manner. Machine learning techniques appear to be a promising foundation for high-quality information extraction performance, requiring only a training corpus of representative input documents that have been annotated by a domain expert. In this paper we will describe innovative research in information extraction, and speculate a bit about the future of information extraction.

CIS is also the name of the associated research area, which has emerged from the synthesis of distributed databases and distributed artificial intelligence. In CIS, software agents mitigate an information environment's heterogeneity by interacting through common protocols, and manage its large size by making intelligent local decisions without centralized control. In order to cope with the dynamism presented by open environments, CIS agents must have the ability to adapt and learn. We discuss some of the most important problems involving learning and adaptivity in CISs, including requirements for reconciling semantics and improving coordination. We present a "customers' view" of learning technology as might find ready application in CISs.

Its task is optimized refueling-design, which is crucial to keep down operation costs at a plant. FUELCON proposes sets of alternative configurations of fuel-allocation; the fuel is positioned in a grid representing the core of a reactor. The practitioner of in-core fuel management uses FUELCON to generate a reasonably good configuration for the situation at hand. The domain expert, on the other hand, resorts to the system to test heuristics and discover new ones, for the task described above. Expert use involves a manual phase of revising the ruleset, based on performance during previous iterations in the same session. This paper is concerned with a new phase: the design of a neural component To carry out the revision automatically. Such an automated revision considers previous performance of the system and uses it for adaptation and learning better rules. The neural component is based on a particular schema for a symbolic to recurrent-analogue bridge, called NIPPL, and on the reinforcement learning of neural networks for the adaptation.

EHW is implemented on a programmable logic device (PLD), whose architecture can be altered by downloading a binary bit string, i.e. architecture bits. The architecture bits are adaptively acquired by genetic algorithms (GA). The target task of EHW is "Boolean concept formation", which has been intensively studied in machine learning literatures. Although many evolutionary or adaptive techniques were proposed to solve this class of problems, there have been very few comparative studies from the viewpoint of computational learning theory. This paper describes machine learning approach to the gate-level EHW, i.e. 1) MDL-based improvement of fitness evaluation, and 2) comparative studies of efficiency by PAC criterion. We also discuss the current extension of EHW and related works.	Electrotech Lab, Ibaraki, Osaka 305, Japan	Iba, H (reprint author), Electrotech Lab, 1-1-4 Umezono, Ibaraki, Osaka 305, Japan.

RULEX (Andrews & Geva 1994, 1995) [1,2], classified as a decompositional technique of rule extraction from trained neural network in a recent survey by Andrews et.;if. [3], is used to extract symbolic rules from data that have been preprocessed by identification of functional dependency. The identification of functional dependency offers several advantages. It can lead to significant reductions in the computational load, to reduction in the number and complexity of derived rules and to the discovery of alternative solutions that would otherwise be ignored by some methods due to implicit or explicit procedural bias. Benchmark datasets fi-om the UCI repository of machine learning databases are used. in the testing. Experimental results indicate that by including functional dependency preprocessing, performance of RULEX can be improved. Good rule quality is obtained by applying RULEX with functional dependency preprocessing when compared to symbolic rule extraction technique C4.5.

This necessitates efficient and dynamic factory scheduling and control procedures This paper addresses a hybrid computing learning scheme, which includes operations reseal ch, genetic algorithm and machine learning techniques, developed for the acquisition of schedule knowledge base to generate robust and effective schedules dynamically and intelligently with respect to part-mix changes in real time. The proposed methodology involves three stages. The first stage consists of generating training examples which are used for the acquisition of knowledge base. The second stage uses an inductive learning algorithm(revised CID3 extended with genetic search process), which automatically generates a feed forward network and learns the training examples. In the final stage, the acquired scheduling knowledge, formed as the hidden layers of the generated network, are formulated as decision rules in order to regulate the flow of parts with optimum schedule.

The direct hand programmming approach uses an explicit model or a behavioral model (subsumption architecture). The machine learning community uses neural network and/or genetic algorithm. We claim that hand programming and learning are complementary, The two approaches used together can be orders of magni tude more powerful than each approach taken separately. We propose a method to combine them both, It includes three concepts : syntactic constraints to restrict the search space, hand-made problem decomposition, hand given fitness. We use this method to solve a complex problem (eight-legged locomotion). It needs 5000 less evaluations compared to when genetic algorithm are used done.

Instead of relying totally on empirical testing, a learning algorithm is used to incrementally define the operational zone with the related parameters described above. Once determined, the operational zone is then used to enhance machining control.

The classification scheme is based on Simpson's fuzzy min-max method and relaxes some assumptions he makes. This enables our scheme to handle mutually nonexclusive classes. The neuro-fuzzy clustering scheme is a multiresolution algorithm that is modeled after the mechanics of human pattern recognition. We also present data from an exhaustive comparison of these techniques with neural, statistical, machine learning, and other traditional approaches to pattern recognition applications. The data sets used for comparisons include those from the machine learning repository at the University of California, Irvine. We find that our proposed schemes compare quite well with the existing techniques, and in addition offer the advantages of one-pass learning and on-line adaptation.

First, different visitors have distinct goals, Second, even a single visitor may have different needs at different times. Much of the information at the site may also be dynamic or time-dependent. Third, as the site grows and evolves, its original design may no longer be appropriate. Finally, a site may be designed for a particular purpose but used in unexpected ways. Web servers record data about user interactions and accumulate this data over time. We believe that AI techniques can be used to examine user access logs in order to automatically improve the site. We challenge the AI community to create adaptive web sites: sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation based on user access data. Several unrelated research projects in plan recognition, machine learning, knowledge representation, and user modeling have begun to explore aspects of this problem. We hope that posing this challenge explicitly will bring these projects together and stimulate fundamental AI research. Success would have a broad and highly visible impact on the web and the AI community.

This paper details an attempt to acquire feelings automatically. We assume that some relations or constraints exist between impressions felt and situations, which consist of an object and its environment. For example, in music arrangement, the object is a music score and its environment contains listeners, etc, Our project validates this assumption through three levels of experiments. At the first level a program simply mimics human arrangements in order to transfer their impressions to another arrangement. This implies that the program is capable of distinguishing patterns that result in some impressions. At the second level, in order to produce a music recognition model, the program locates relations and constraints between a music score and its impressions, by which we show that machine learning techniques may provide a powerful tool for composing music and analyzing human feelings. Finally, rye examine the generality of the model by modifying some arrangements to provide the subjects with a specified impression.

Since most learning algorithms have domain-specific parameters, it is a popular custom to adapt these parameters to obtain a minimal error rate on the test set. The same rate is then used to rank the algorithm, which causes an optimistic bias, We quantify this bias, showing, in particular, that an algorithm with more parameters will probably be ranked higher than an equally good algorithm with fewer parameters. We demonstrate this result, showing the number of parameters and trials required in order to pretend to outperform C4.5 or FOIL, respectively, for various benchmark problems. We then describe out how unbiased ranking experiments should be conducted.

In this research we have been building an office-conversant mobile robot which autonomously moves around in an office environment, actively gathers information through close interaction with this environment including sensing multi-modal data and making dialog with people in the office, and acquires knowledge about the environment with which it ultimately becomes conversant. Here our major concerns are in how the close interaction between the learning system and its social environment can help or accelerate the system's learning process, and what kinds of prepared mechanisms are necessary for the emergence of such interactions. The office-conversant robot is a platform on which we implement our ideas and test their feasibility in a real-world setting. An overview of the system is given and two examples of implemented ideas, i.e. dialog-based map acquisition and route acquisition by following, are described in detail.

This method has been demonstrated for the skill of learning to fill an aircraft in a flight simulator. The simulator has been augmented to interact with a knowledge acquisition program for creating rules and logging the pilot's actions along with flight information. We have developed a method called Dynamic Ripple Down Rules for knowledge acquisition and Learning Dynamic Ripple Down Rules for automatically generating rules from the logged data. The rules were tested by running the flight simulator in autopilot mode where the autopilot code is implemented by the rules.

Such a control skill is typically hard to reconstruct through introspection. Therefore an attractive approach to the reconstruction of control skill involves machine learning from operators' control traces, also known as behavioural cloning. In the most common approach to behavioural cloning, a, controller is induced in the form of a rule set or a decision or regression tree that maps system states to actions, Unfortunately, induced controllers usually suffer from lack of robustness and lack typical elements of human control strategies, such as subgoals and substages of the control plan. In this paper we present a new approach to behavioural cloning which involves the induction of a model of the controlled sa stem and enables the identification of subgoals that the operator is pursuing at various stages of the execution trace. The underlying formal basis far the present approach to behavioural cloning is the theory of LQ controllers. Experimental results show that this approach greatly improves the robustness of the induced controllers and also offers a new way of understanding the operator's subcognitive skill.

An important aspect of the research that has been ignored in the past is the learning or discovering of interesting holes in the database. If we view each case in the database as a point in a k-dimensional space, then a hole is simply a region in the space that contains no data point. Clearly, not every hole is interesting. Some holes are obvious because it is known that certain value combinations are not possible. Some holes exist because there are insufficient cases in the database. However, in some situations, empty regions do carry important information. For instance, they could warn us about some missing value combinations that are either not known before or are unexpected. Knowing these missing value combinations may lead to significant discoveries. in this paper, we propose an algorithm to discover holes in databases.

It describes the deterioration of generalisation performance of a trained model, In this paper, we investigate: the ability of a novel artificial neural network, BP-SOM, to avoid overfitting, BP-SOM is a hybrid neural network which combines a multi-layered feed-forward network (MFN) with Kohonen's self-organising maps (SOMs). During training, supervised back-propagation learning and unsupervised SOM learning cooperate in finding adequate hidden-layer representations. We show that BP-SOM outperforms standard back-propagation, and also back-propagation with a weight decay when dealing with the problem of overfitting. In addition, we show that BP-SOM succeeds in preserving generalisation performance under hidden-unit pruning, where both other methods fail.

Such information is often relational and is best represented by a set of directed graphs. A machine learning technique called graph-based induction (GBI) efficiently extracts regularities from such data, based on which a user-adaptive interface is built that can predict next command, generate scripts and prefetch files in a multi task environment. The heart of GBI is pairwise chunking. The paper shows how this simple. mechanism applies to the top down induction of decision trees for nested attribute representation as well as finding frequently occurring patterns in a graph. The results clearly shows that the dependency analysis of computational processes activated by the user commands which is made possible by GBI is indeed useful to build a behavior model and increase prediction accuracy.

In machine learning, two major approaches to speed-up learning exist: Those which interwine the learning and the optimization process and those which clearly separate them. We follow the latter line of thought and present a new restructuring method for chain Datalog programs which have been learned by ILP algorithms. During the restructuring process, rules for new, intermediate concepts are introduced which are used to modify the original program. We proof that this transformation does not change the coverage of a given set of learned target concepts. We show the details of the implemented algorithm which has been successfully applied to a real-world robot navigation domain. Finally, we show that the restructuring method yields a program which can be evaluated faster than the original one. This speed up is achieved by program decompositions.

S	Goncalves, ME		Muggleton, S		Goncalves, ME			Handling quantifiers in ILP	INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Logic Program Synthesis and Transformation (LOPSTR 96) / 6th Inductive Logic Programming Workshop (ILP 96)	AUG 28-30, 1996	STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN	Network Computat Log, European Commiss, ESPRIT Compulog Net				An important research area in the field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is concerned with predicate learning. Recently, many predicate learners have been developed whose task consists in learning a definition of a concept from positive and negative examples. In most of them, the definition of the concept is represented by a set of definite (or normal) clauses. The variables that appear in the head of a clause (the head-variables) are universally quantified, and the variables that appear only in the body of the clause (the body-variables) are existentially quantified. Some predicate learners described in the ILP literature are able to deal with such existential (body-)variables, using some language bias like ij-determinacy (see [11]). However, as far as the authors know, no ILP system is able to deal with clauses in whose body both existential and universal body-variables appear. Moreover, there exists no generalisation and no specialisation operator that handle such body-variables. In this paper, we first present a set of generalisation/specialisation rules devoted to deal with existential and universal variables that appear only in the body of the clauses. We then highlight some properties of these rules, essentially correctness and completeness theorems. We do not explicit any type of control that could permit to exploit practically these rules in an ILP system, however we give some ideas of how to integrate them in different sorts of systems with minor modifications and without increasing the search space too greatly. Following the motivation of ILP systems with respect to more classical machine learning ones, an important motivation of these rules is to extend the expressiveness of the ILP representation formalism (clauses without any Skolem functions, i.e. with only existential body-variables). Moreover, a significant interest of the q-operators presented in this paper is that several existing ILP systems can be adapted (with some modifications) to process quantifiers in the body of clauses and thus increase their expressiveness.

Such techniques hold the promise of being able to make sense of a variety of inputs of different types, in producing an output. Software cost modelling has always appeared to be a rather hit-or-miss business where statistical methods frequently result in low accuracy of prediction. Some experiments using a neural network - a CMAC or Albus perceptron - have been conducted, highlighting some of the problems that arise when machine learning techniques ate applied to software cost modelling. These experiments show that, compared with conventional regression analysis, improved accuracy of prediction is possible.

Buildings can be easily represented as parameterized graphs from which p-subisomorphic graphs will be computed. P-graphs will be defined and an upper bound complexity estimation of the computation of p-subisomorphims will be given. In order to reduce search space we will discuss several pruning mechanisms. Background knowledge requires a classification in order to receive a probability distribution which will serve as a priori knowledge for 3D building reconstruction. Therefore, we will apply an alternative view of nearest-neighbor classification to measured knowledge in order to learn based on a complete seed and a noise model a distribution of this knowledge. An application of an extensive scene consisting of 1846 building cluster which are represented as p-graphs in order to estimate a probability distribution of corner nodes demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. An evaluation using the information coding theory determines the information gain which is provided by the estimated distribution in comparison with no available a priori knowledge.

Many factors that might influence the survival of patients have been suggested. The aim of this study was to determine which of the factors, known at the time of admission to the hospital, might predict survival of the patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Our aim was also to assess the relative importance of the factors and to identify potentially useful decision and regression trees generated by machine learning algorithms. Our study included 126 patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma treated at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana from 1972 to 1992. In this chapter, we compare the machine learning approach with previous statistical evaluations of the problem (univariate and multivariate analysis) and show that it can provide a more thorough analysis and improve the understanding of the data.

Attributes included age, sex and education plus responses to the Functional Activities Questionnaire, the Mini-Mental Status and Blessed Orientation, Memory and Concentration tests. The machine learning algorithms included decision tree learners (C4.5, CART), rule inducers (C4.5 Rules, FOCL) and naive Bayes. Stepwise logistic regression was used to compare results. The sample was randomly split into training and testing sets, and the results were validated over 30 runs. Although the Functional Activities Questionnaire has been used since 1980, the machine learning algorithms were the first to identify that a single attribute, measuring forgetfulness, equaled or exceeded the accuracy of any other scoring method of this test. Post hoc inspection of the odds ratios obtained by stepwise logistic regression confirmed this finding. The application of machine learning has identified an extremely simple, yet accurate screen for very mild dementia.

The classifiers were taken from different paradigms of machine learning (symbolic, statistical and neural) in order to encapsulate the different approaches. The unsolved problem of coronary artery disease progression consists of predicting the stenosis (narrowing of the coronary artery) change on the basis of clinical, laboratory and epidemiological attributes. A total of 263 patients belonging to two classes (stenosis changed vs. non-changed) were described with 25 attributes. The overall results are not promising and suggest that the attributes used are not sufficiently relevant to enable the prediction of coronary artery disease progression. It should also be pointed out that the simplest classifiers (the naive Bayesian classifier and linear discriminant method) generally yield the best results. This phenomenon seems to be typical for medical data and is consistent with our previous experience.

In a medical application it is crucial that a machine learning system is capable of detecting regularities in the data by appropriately dealing with imperfect data, i.e., data that contains various kinds of errors, either random or systematic. This chapter presents a compression-based method that is capable of detecting data which is suspected to contain errors and is therefore unsuitable for the extraction of genuine regularities. This noise elimination method is applied to a problem of early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases which is known to be difficult due to its nature and to the imperfections in the available dataset. The method is evaluated by applying the noise elimination algorithm in conjunction with the CN2 rule induction algorithm, and by comparing their performance to earlier results obtained by CN2 in this diagnostic domain.

They are of significant chemical and commercial interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical effecters. The interpretation of diterpene C-13 NMR-spectra normally requires specialists with detailed spectroscopic knowledge and substantial experience in natural products chemistry, more specifically knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. Given a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure, we apply machine learning approaches to discover correlations between peak patterns and chemical structure. Backpropagation neural networks, nearest neighbor classification and decision tree induction are applied, as well as approaches from the field of inductive logic programming.

The method is based on decision table decomposition, a machine learning approach that decomposes a given decision table into an equivalent hierarchy of decision tables. The decomposition aims to discover the decision tables that are overall less complex than the initial one, potentially easier to interpret, and introduce new and meaningful intermediate concepts. The chapter introduces the decomposition method and, through decomposition-based data analysis of two neurophysiological datasets, shows that the decomposition can discover physiologically meaningful concept hierarchies and construct interpretable decision tables which reveal relevant physiological principles.

Towards that end, a machine capable of learning needs to be able to abstract bodies of complex high-dimensional data into manageable grouping and be able to discern and articulate relationships between such data items. This discussion describes how 2D depictions of multivariate data can support such Machine Learning activities. A new dimension-reduction procedure is described schematically. It seems to generate mappings which have useful 'topologically correct' characteristics. Previous related data abstraction schemes are discussed briefly for comparison purposes. In the case of interrelated tasks and corresponding bodies of 2D maps, the latter can facilitate the recognition of associations and the inference of rules, important components of Machine Learning.

Facing a new design case, an experienced designer will recall the similar cases in case base been solved before. Then, the designer will attempt to find the solution from these similar cases in a way of adaptation or synthesis. In this paper, an unsupervised fuzzy neural network (UFN) case-based learning model has been developed to perform the aforementioned design process and implemented in two steps. The UFN learning model has been applied to the domain of engineering design. The learning results show that the learning performance of the new learning model is superior to that of a supervised learning model only in complicated or discrete domains. Also, the unsupervised fuzzy neural network learning model can learn complicated design problems within a reasonable CPU time.

A learning model using conditional attributes was used in this study, which divides a problem into either an attribute or a decision. Through the input of attribute values, the system can present the required decision by inference. With this model, the training of the system can produce acceptable results. This learning model is also used to establish a multiple decision type selection system for coordinate measuring machines to assist the user in choosing an appropriate coordinate measuring machine.

Peptide binding to MHC molecules is necessary for immune recognition, but only a subset of peptides are capable of binding to a particular MHC molecule. Common amino acid patterns (binding motifs) have been observed in sets of peptides that bind to specific MHC molecules. Recently, matrix models for peptide/MHC interaction have been reported. These encode the rules of peptide/MHC interactions for an individual MHC molecule as a 20x9 matrix where the contribution to binding of each amino acid at each position within a 9-mer peptide is quantified. The artificial intelligence techniques of genetic search and machine learning have proved to be very useful in the area of biological sequence analysis. The availability of peptide/MHC binding data can facilitate derivation of binding matrices using machine learning techniques. We performed a simulation study to determine the minimum number of peptide samples required to derive matrices, given the pre-defined accuracy of the matrix model. The matrices were derived using a genetic search. In addition, matrices for peptide binding to the human class I MHC molecules, HLA-B35 and -A24, were derived, validated by independent experimental data and compared to previously-reported matrices. The results indicate that at least 150 peptide samples are required to derive matrices of acceptable accuracy. This result is based on a maximum noise content of 5%, the availability of precise affinity measurements and that acceptable accuracy is determined by an area under the Relative Operating Characteristic curve (Aroc) of >0.8. More than 600 peptide samples are required to derive matrices of excellent accuracy (Aroc>0.9). Finally, we derived a human HLA-B27 binding matrix using a genetic search and 404 experimentally-tested peptides, and estimated its accuracy at Aroc>0.88. The results of this study are expected to be of practical interest to immunologists for efficient identification of peptides as candidates for immunotherapy.

Given features that can be computed from the amino-acid sequence in a straightforward fashion (such as pi, molecular weight, and amino-acid composition), the technique allows us to answer questions such as: Is the protein an enzyme? If so, in which Enzyme Commission (EC) class does it belong? Our approach uses machine learning (AIL) techniques to induce classifiers that predict the EC class of an enzyme from features extracted from its primary sequence. We report on a variety of experiments in which we explored the use of three different ML techniques in conjunction with training datasets derived from PDB and from Swiss-Prot. We also explored the use of several different feature sets. Our method is able to predict the first EC number of an enzyme with 74% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of six broad categories of enzyme function), and to predict the second EC number of an enzyme with 68% accuracy (thereby assigning the enzyme to one of 57 subcategories of enzyme function). This technique could be a valuable complement to sequence-similarity searches and to pathway-analysis methods.

IEEE Comp Soc, Test Technol Tech Comm, IEEE Philadelphia Sect				This paper presents a new approach for designing test sequences to be generated on-chip. The proposed technique is based on machine learning, and provides a way to generate efficient patterns to be used during BIST test pattern generation. The main idea is that test patterns detecting random pattern resistant faults are not embedded in a pseudo-random sequence as in existing techniques, but rather are used to produce relevant features allowing to generate directed random test patterns that detect random pattern resistant faults as well as easy-to-test faults. A BIST implementation that uses a classical LFSR plus a small amount of mapping logic is also proposed in this paper. Results are shown for benchmark circuits which indicate that our technique can reduce the weighted or pseudo-random test length required for a particular fault coverage. Other results are given to show the possible trade off between hardware overhead and test sequence length. An encouraging point is that results presented in this paper, although they are comparable with those of existing mixed-mode techniques, have been obtained with a machine learning tool not specifically developed for BIST generation and therefore may significantly be improved.

However, the development of such tools requires a prior acquisition of constructability knowledge. In this paper, results of a feasibility study of automated constructability knowledge acquisition are reported. In the conducted research, constructability of a beam in a reinforced-concrete frame has been investigated. For this problem, a knowledge representation space has been developed, relevant constructability data has been acquired from industry, and a collection of examples has been prepared. In this collection, each example represents a structural design concept evaluated from the point of view of its constructability. The collection of examples has been used by a learning system to acquire from them constructability knowledge in the form of decision rules.

J	Wang, WY; Gero, JS				Wang, WY; Gero, JS			Sequence-based prediction in conceptual design of bridges	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper explores the application of a machine learning technique in knowledge support systems in civil engineering design. It presents a sequence-based prediction method for engineering design and demonstrates its utility in the conceptual design of bridges. The basic idea of sequence-based prediction is that the most recent numbers of similar design cases are used in predicting the characteristics of the next design and more recent cases are given stronger influence on decision making in the new design situation than older ones. This paper develops a model of sequence-based prediction and carries out a number of experiments using it. It is then applied to a set of standard data and the results of using a sequence-based prediction method are compared with other methods. The empirical results show the potential applications of the method in engineering design.

An IR system which could make use of this context may be better able to match the specific need. A machine-learning approach to inferring the user's context is described, and the results of an evaluation experiment are given. There appears to be scope for IR systems to operate in this way.

J	Barrera, J; Dougherty, ER; Tomita, NS				Barrera, J; Dougherty, ER; Tomita, NS			Automatic programming of binary morphological machines by design of statistically optimal operators in the context of computational learning theory	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY; FILTERS; REPRESENTATION; PRECISION; MAPPINGS	Representation of set operators by artificial neural networks and design of such operators by inference of network parameters is a popular technique in binary image analysis. We propose an alternative to this technique: automatic programming of morphological machines (MMachs) by the design of statistically optimal operators. We propose a formulation of the procedure for designing set operators that extends the one stated by Dougherty for binary image restoration, show the relation of this new formulation with the one stated by Haussler for learning Boolean concepts in the context of machine learning theory (which usually is applied to neural networks), present a new learning algorithm for Boolean concepts represented as MMach programs, and give some application examples in binary image analysis.

However, some knowledge which might be quite useful for maintenance purposes, remains implicit and disseminated in the rule base. We present an original approach for the discovery of such implicit knowledge, based on machine learning techniques. We will illustrate the use of our approach in the book-keeping domain, where it has proven its interest within the scope of an industrial project.

Particularly, in ill-structured domains where there is no clear idea about which concepts exist, inductive unsupervised learning systems appear to be a promising approach to help experts in the early stages of the acquisition process. In this paper we examine the concept of inductive bias, which have received great attention from the ML community, and discuss the importance of bias shift when using ML algorithms to help experts in constructing a knowledge base (KB) A simple framework for the interaction of the expert with the inductive system exploiting bias shift is shown. Also, it is suggested that under some assumptions, bias selection in unsupervised learning may be performed via parameter setting, thus allowing the user to shift the system bias externally.

CLIPS is an extension of the CLILP2 algorithm. CLIP3 generates multiple rules for a given concept from two sets of discrete attribute data. It combines the best concepts of tree-based and rule-based algorithms to produce a highly reliable machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm is run on the benchmark ''MONK's data sets''. Compares the results of standard machine learning algorithms such as the ID and AQ families of algorithms. The algorithm is also run on the breast cancer data set and the results are compared with C4.5 algorithm results.

J	Blum, A				Blum, A			Empirical support for Winnow and Weighted-Majority algorithms: Results on a calendar scheduling domain	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Winnow; Weighted-Majority; multiplicative algorithms		This paper describes experimental results on using Winnow and Weighted-Majority based algorithms on a real-world calendar scheduling domain. These two algorithms have been highly studied in the theoretical machine learning literature. We show here that these algorithms can be quite competitive practically, outperforming the decision-tree approach currently in use in the Calendar Apprentice system in terms of both accuracy and speed. One of the contributions of this paper is a new variant on the Winnow algorithm (used in the experiments) that is especially suited to conditions with suing-valued classifications, and we give a theoretical analysis of its performance. In addition we show how Winnow can be applied to achieve a good accuracy/coverage tradeoff and explore issues that arise such as concept drift. We also provide an analysis of a policy for discarding predictors in Weighted-Majority that allows it to speed up as it learns.

The usual advantage of such structuring of the learning problem is that it makes the learning easier and improves the comprehensibility of induced descriptions. In this paper, we develop a technique for discovering useful intermediate concepts when both the class and the attributes are real-valued. The technique is based on a decomposition method originally developed for the design of switching circuits and recently extended to handle incompletely specified multi-valued functions. It was also applied to machine learning tasks. In this paper, we introduce modifications, needed to decompose real functions and to present them in symbolic form. The method is evaluated on a number of test functions. The results show that the method correctly decomposes fairly complex functions. The decomposition hierarchy does not depend on a given repertoir of basic functions (background knowledge).

In order to invent a new concept, one has to discover such a duster. The necessary tool for clustering is a metric, or pseudo-metric. Here are presented families of pseudometrics which seem well suited to such tasks. On terms and literals, we construct a new kind of metric from the substitutions which arise through subsumption. From these, it is easy to form metrics on clauses, by a technique due to F.Hausdorff. They will be applicable to generalization from sets of ground clauses, to discovery of heuristic guidance for theorem proving, and to inductive logic programming.

The GRG system generalizes data, reduces the number of attributes, and generates decision rules. A subsystem of this software learns decision rules using familiar and novel rule induction techniques and uses these rules to make decisions. This paper provides an overview of GRG, describes those aspects of the system most relevant to creating and using decision rules, and compares it to other machine learning approaches.

We introduce an analysis method, based on machine learning techniques. The method provides insight into the nature of the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty. In this article, building on previous research concerning brand and dealer loyalty, the relationship between satisfaction with the car, satisfaction with the dealer (sales and after-sales), brand loyalty and dealer loyalty (sales and after-sales) has been investigated. The method has been evaluated and the results are compared with the results of a frequently used method.

This limited attention for work on empirical learning of language knowledge and behaviour from text and speech data seems unjustified. After all, it is becoming apparent that empirical learning of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can alleviate NLP's all-time main problem, viz. the knowledge acquisition bottleneck: empirical ML methods such as rule induction, top down induction of decision trees, lazy learning, inductive logic programming, and some types of neural network learning, seem to be excellently suited to automatically induce exactly that knowledge that is hard to gather by hand. In this paper we address the question why NLP is an interesting application for empirical ML, and provide a brief overview of current work in this area.

The ability to learn, i.e., to adapt to preferences, abilities and behaviour of a user and to peculiarities of the task at hand, should provide for both a wider range of application and a higher degree of acceptance of agent technology. In this paper, we discuss the role of Machine Learning as a basic technology for human-agent interaction and motivate the need for interdisciplinary approaches to solve problems related to communication with artificial agents for task specification, teaching, or information retrieval purposes.

We argue that a lot of further research is still needed, outline the directions that such research should go and describe the expected results.

J	Lang, GK; Seitz, P				Lang, GK; Seitz, P			Robust classification of arbitrary object classes based on hierarchical spatial feature-matching	MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						object classification; templates; machine learning; binary matched filters; computer vision	INTENSITY CHANGES; VISION SYSTEMS; RECOGNITION; COMPUTER; POINTS; CURVES	We present a novel approach to the robust classification of arbitrary object classes in complex, natural scenes. Starting from a re-appraisal of Marr's 'primal sketch', we develop an algorithm that(1) employs local orientations as the fundamental picture primitives, rather than the more usual edge locations, (2) retains and exploits the local spatial arrangement of features of different complexity in an image and (3) is hierarchically arranged so that the level of feature abstraction increases at each processing stage. The resulting, simple technique is based on the accumulation of evidence in binary channels, followed by a weighted, non-linear sum of the evidence accumulators. The steps involved in designing a template for recognizing a simple object are explained. The practical application of the algorithm is illustrated, with examples taken from a broad range of object classification problems. We discuss the performance of the algorithm and describe a hardware implementation. First successful attempts to train the algorithm, automatically, are presented. Finally, we compare our algorithm with other object classification algorithms described in the literature.

It is an anthropomimetic technique and consinsts of three parts. At the first stage, the clinicians' scan of the ECG traces is imitated and changes in the shape of QRS are quantified. In the sequel, a clinician involves in the interpretation of the most prominent changes providing the patient-dependent prototypes for the subsequent machine learning procedure. Finally, a classification scheme incorporates the portion of medical knowledge needed to explore the whole patient's EGG. This scheme, being very robust to noise, presents excellent generalization properties and can serve as a reliable automation in a future examination of the certain subject.

In the case of inflammatory bowel disease, quality of life greatly differs through phases of remissions and relapses. Could the quality of life questionnaire tell the difference? In this study we are disclosing possibilities of assessing patients' perspectives by analysing analogue scale statements regarding concerns and worries related to ulcerative colitis. Some two hundred Swedish patients, 3/4 in remission and 14 in relapse, filled out a booklet containing 36 statements. To characterise the disease activity, we have used multivariate discrimination. To structure and describe in details path distinguishing the remission from relapse, we have used an artificial intelligence procedure. Applications of the CART (Classification And Regression Trees) algorithm resulted in a set of classifiers which are, based on the similar subsets of significant variables, i.e. statements. Best reached classification accuracy did not exceed 80 % in any case. Other classifiers namely, K-nearest-neighbour (KNN), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) confirmed that outcome. An expectation that the disease activity should clearly speak throughout the questionnaire held for a certain number of the observation such as pain and suffering, loss of bowel control, dying early, felling alone, ability to have children, being treated as different and concerns regarding th medication. To highlight the difference of incorrect 20%, K-means clustering was performed. The results settled a basis for a hypothesis that the studied quality of life instrument captures more than the disease activity.

It sits at the common frontiers of several fields including Data Base Management, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, and Data Visualization. From a statistical perspective it can be viewed as computer automated exploratory data analysis of (usually) large complex data sets. In spite of (or perhaps because of) the somewhat exaggerated hype, this field is having a major impact in business, industry, and science. It also affords enormous research opportunities for new methodological developments. Despite the obvious connections between data mining and statistical data analysis, most of the methodologies used in Data Mining have so far originated in fields other than Statistics. This paper explores some of the reasons for this, and why statisticians should have an interest in Data Mining. It is argued that Statistics can potentially have a major influence on Data Mining, but in order to do so some of our basic paradigms and operating principles may have to be modified.

Today's users of computer systems are expanded to ordinary people, Furthermore, too much network accessible information resources in the form of various media increases rapidly everyday. The primary goal of the intelligent Multimedia Repository(IMR) is to assist users in accessing multimedia information efficiently, Primary users of the IMR are assumed to be novice users even though the system can be used for users at different levels of expertise, Users are not well-trained people in using computer systems. Thus, the semantic gap between users and the system must be mainly reduced from the system site. The technology of intelligent user interface is adopted to minimize the semantic gap. For the intelligent user interface of the IMR, a Human Computer Interaction(HCI) model has been devised, and the IUI for the IMR has been designed and developed. Machine learning technologies have been employed to provide user adaptation/intelligent capability to the sq-stem. The IUI of the IMR consists User Interface Manager(UIM), and User Model(UM). The UIM performs the function of managing intelligent user interface. The UM stores the behavioral knowledge of the user. The UM stores the history of query and response interactions to absorb communication errors due to semantic gaps between the user and the IMR. The UM is implemented by decision tree based Case-Based Reasoning(CBR) and back propagation neural networks. Experimental results show the IUI can improve the performance of the IMR.

Two of the most popular models that have been recently proposed, Valiant's PAC learning model and Angluin's query learning model, can be thought of as refinements of preceding models such as Gold's classic paradigm of identification in the limit, in which the question of how fast the learning can take place is emphasized. A considerable amount of results have been obtained within these two frameworks, resolving the learnability questions of many important classes of functions and languages. These two particular learning models are by no means comprehensive, and many important aspects of learning are not directly addressed in these models. Aiming towards more realistic theories of learning, many new models and extensions of existing learning models that attempt to formalize such aspects have been developed recently. In this paper, we will review some of these new extensions and models in computational learning theory, concentrating in particular on those proposed and studied by researchers at Theory NEC Laboratory RWCP, and their colleagues at other institutions.

With the algorithm we introduce, for the first time, a generalization phase to Summers' method. Moreover, we present a new bottm-up inference method which combines elements of the generalization algorithm, a minimal multiple generalization algorithm, and Summers' method.

A lot of work in this domain deals with decision trees. In this paper, we are concerned with a different kind of technique based on Galois lattices or concept lattices. We present a new semilattice based system, IGLUE, that uses the entropy function with a top-down approach to select concepts during the lattice construction. Then IGLUE generates new relevant numerical features by transforming initial boolean features over these concepts. IGLUE uses the new features to redescribe examples. Finally, IGLUE applies the Mahanalobis distance as a similarity measure between examples.

However, it usually tends to create more categories than are actually needed. This often causes the so called overfitting problem, namely the performance of the networks in test set is not monotonically increasing with the additional training epochs and category creation, for fuzzy ARTMAP. In order to avoid the overfitting problem, Carpenter and Tan [Carpenter and Tan, 1993] proposed tr confidence-based pruning method by eliminating those categories that were either less useful or less accurate. This paper purposes yet another-alternative pruning method that is based on the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle can be viewed as a tradeoff between theory complexity and data prediction accuracy given the theory. We adopted Cameron-Jones' error encoding scheme and Quinlan's modifier for theory encoding to estimate the fuzzy ARTMAP theory description length. A greedy search algorithm of the minimum description length to prune the fuzzy ARTMAP categories one by one is proposed. The experiments showed that fuzzy ARTMAP pinned with the MDL principle Save better performance with far fewer categories created than the original fuzzy ARTMAP and other machine learning systems on a number of benchmark clinical databases such as heart disease, breath cancer and diabetes databases.

To design schemes of databases is one of knowledge acquisitions. One of deficiencies in database design is there are no unique solutions. In addition, we can not avoid an evolution of the schemes, because of database paradigm. It is useful to employ AI methodologies as machine learning or knowledge discovery in database design. In this paper, we assume ISA hierarchies as a knowledge control, examine the data, and present a knowledge acquisition, method to discover or find the difference of type schemes, in a sense of approximation, between a scheme knowledge and a knowledge obtained from database instances.

An evaluation function is used to approximate the goodness of different partition candidates. Most existing methods for multisplitting on numerical attributes are based on heuristics, because of the apparent efficiency advantages. We characterize a class of well-behaved cumulative evaluation functions for which efficient discovery of the optimal multisplit is possible by dynamic programming. A single pass through the data sumces to evaluate multisplits of all arities. This class contains many important attribute evaluation functions familiar from symbolic machine learning research. Our empirical experiments convey that there is no significant differences in efficiency between the method that produces optimal partitions and those that are based on heuristics. Moreover, we demonstrate that optimal multisplitting can be beneficial in decision tree learning in contrast to using the much applied binarization of numerical attributes or heuristical multisplitting.

B	Schadler, K; Wysotzki, F		Komorowski, J; Zytkow, J		Schadler, K; Wysotzki, F			A connectionist approach to structural similarity determination as a basis of clustering, classification and feature detection	PRINCIPLES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st European Symposium on Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (PKDD 97)	JUN 24-27, 1997	TRONDHEIM, NORWAY					Many algorithms in machine learning, knowledge discovery, pattern recognition and classification are based on the estimation of the similarity or the distance between the analysed objects. Objects with higher structural complexity often cannot be described by feature vectors without losing important structural information. These objects can adequately be represented in the language of logic or by labeled graphs. The similarity of such descriptions is difficult to define and to compute. In this paper, a connectionist approach for the determination of the similarity of arbitrary labeled graphs is introduced. Using an example from organic chemistry, the application of the approach within one distance based and one generalisation based classfication algorithm is demonstrated. The generalisation based algorithm forms clusters or subclasses of similar examples of the same class and extracts the parts of the objects which determine the class of the object. The algorithms perform very satisfactorily in comparison with recent logical and feature vector approaches. Moreover, being able to handle structural data directly, the algorithms need only a subset of the given features of the objects for classification.

Unlike global view on the algorithms (evaluation of overall accuracy on some testing data) or unlike multistrategy learning (voting of more classifiers), we propose "local" evaluation for each example using one classifier. The basic idea is to learn to classify the correct decisions made by the classifier. This is done by creating new class attribute "match" and by running the learning algorithm on the same input attributes. We call this (second) step verification. Some first preliminary experimental results of this method used with C4.5 and CN4 are reported. These results show that: (1) if the classification accuracy is very high, it makes no sence to perform the verification step (since the verification step will create only the majority rule), (2) in multiple-class and/or noisy domains the verification accuracy can be significantly higher then the classification accuracy.

The only practical way is to design modular neural network systems consisting of simple modules. While there has been a lot of work on combining different modules in a modular system in the fields of neural networks, statistics, and machine learning, little work has been done on how to design those modules automatically and how to exploit the interaction between individual module design and module combination. This paper proposes an evolutionary approach to designing modular neural networks. The approach addresses the issue of automatic determination of the number of individual modules and the exploitation of the interaction between individual module design and module combination. The relationship among different modules is considered during the module design. This is quite different from the conventional approach where the module design is separated from the module combination. Experimental results on some benchmark problems are presented and discussed in this paper.

The nonlinear relationship between stimulus and motion, and the biomechanical interaction among muscles were analyzed to determine the feasibility of using machine learning technique. A stepped stimulation paradigm was used to one electrode while a continuous bias stimulation was applied to a second electrode in an incomplete hemiplegic subject. 43 stimulus combinations were tested. The result limb motions (7 joint angles) were measured using a three-dimensional magnetic tracking system. The biomechanical interaction. e.g.. the supinator depression by the wrist extensor was quantitatively described.

We have previously demonstrated that adaptive logic networks (ALNs) can be used in gait event discrimination (GED) and automatic design of control algorithms for FES-assisted locomotion. Machine learning techniques for supervised learning generalize well in cloning the skill of the subject controlling the stimulation manually. However, safe operation of a GED-based control system applied to a highly variable human walking may require more redundancy than ALNs alone can provide. A practical method was designed to provide additional safety for the subject. Functional errors of the FES-control system were defined to evaluate its performance, and restriction rules (RRs), based on a priori knowledge about the subject's walking, were introduced to verify decisions made by ALNs and to eliminate infrequent functional errors. Our results demonstrated that RRs can completely eliminate critical functional errors if a certain level of ALN training is achieved. Our future efforts are directed toward expanding the training error assessment method to define the training level required for error-free performance.

The simple structure that represents fuzzy rules in a neural network uses a rule extraction mechanism varying from most other approaches as it is based on concepts of machine learning. An additional, straightforward optimization eventually enhances the performance of the diagnosis. The approach is especially designed for the needs of technical fault diagnosis using parity space, observer and parameter estimation techniques. It evaluates parameter as well as parity space residuals and other information from the faulty process. Prior knowledge can easily be included as rules due to the simple structure of the scheme. The approach is tested on an electrical d.c. motor test bench to which several different faults can be applied.

The algorithm incorporates a Filter Bank (FB) which decomposes the ECG into subbands with uniform frequency bandwidths. The FB-based algorithm enables independent time and frequency analysis to be performed on the EGG. Various features are computed from the subbands to distinguish between between paced and non-paced beats. These features are computed in a very computationally efficient manner. A machine learning method is used to design a decision tree to be used in the classification process. The classification algorithms were tested on records from the MIT/BIH database. The paced beat classification algorithm has a sensitivity of 87.64 % and a positive predictivity of 90.97 %. The FB-based structure is useful for performing multiple ECG processing tasks using one set of preprocessing filters.

The input consisted of the hip and knee joint angles, horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces recorded in an able-bodied human. The output data consisted of the patterns of muscle activities. These patterns were obtained from simulation of walking with a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system. The simulation takes into account the individual biomechanical characteristics of the eventual user having spinal cord injury (SCI). The mappings were tested using numerous data from five minutes of walking previously not used for the training. We illustrate the technique by presenting the estimation of the activations of the equivalent flexor knee muscle and the knee joint sensor for four strides. The correlation is better and tracking errors are smaller when the combination of IL and RBF is used compared to the usage of IL or RBF. We show that the prediction of sensory state is achievable; thus, the delays imposed by the properties of the neuro-muscular system can be minimized.

There are several major problems with Chinese character recognition Chinese characters are distinct and ideographic, the character size is very large and a lot of structurally similar characters exist in the character set. Thus, classification criteria are difficult to generate. This paper presents a new technique far the recognition of hand-printed Chinese characters using machine learning C4.5. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The paper also discusses Chinese character recognition using Dominant point feature extraction and C4.5. The system was tested with 900 characters (each character has 40 samples) and the rate of recognition obtained was 84%.

In a battlefield environment, it is often important to have access to rapid scheduling techniques that produce effective and efficient schedules. Standard approaches to scheduling may be ineffective whenever the characteristics of the schedule to be generated - its size, its complexity, interactions among its components, etc. - make it difficult to generate a satisfactory schedule in a reasonable amount of time. In such cases it may be possible to produce near-optimal schedules rapidly through the use of Genetic Algorithms, a sub-symbolic machine learning technique. This approach evolves a schedule probabilistically from a population of schedules, rather than attempting to generate one deterministically. Results obtained in a project to generate mission schedules for U. S. Army engineering units demonstrate that schedules can be evolved relatively rapidly, and that the quality of these schedules is high.

Many psychological models of categorization, on the other hand, assume that an entire set of features is known. We present a new model of categorization, called Categorization by Elimination, that uses as few features as possible to make an accurate category assignment. This algorithm demonstrates that it is possible to have a categorization process that is fast and frugal-using fewer features than other categorization methods-yet still highly accurate in its judgments. We show that Categorization by Elimination does as well as human subjects on a multi-feature categorization task, judging intention from animate motion, and that it does as well as other categorization algorithms on data sets from machine learning. Specific predictions of the Categorization by Elimination algorithm, such as the order of cue use during categorization and the time-course of these decisions, still need to be tested against human performance.

A variety of techniques from statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, machine learning, and neural networks have been proposed to understand the data by discovering useful categories. However, to date research in data mining has not paid attention to the cognitive factors that make learned categories comprehensible. We show that one factor which influences the comprehensibility of learned models is consistency with existing knowledge and describe a learning algorithm that creates concepts with this goal in mind.

The design of learning methods to learn concept descriptions in linguistic environments is thus very important. In this paper, we apply fuzzy set concepts to machine learning to solve this problem. A fuzzy learning algorithm based on the maximum information gain is proposed to manage linguistic information. Experiments on the sport classification problem are to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the rules derived from our approach are simpler and yields high accuracy.

The system was tested on finding the differential diagnostic rules for female urinary incontinence. Galactica found accurate and general differential diagnostic rules for stress, mixed and sensory urge incontinence. Also the effectiveness of Michalski's concept generalization and specialization operators was studied. Michalski's operators proved to be especially useful in improving the learning process when the quality of the initial population is low. The results suggest that genetic algoritm-based machine learning is a useful technique for the rule discovery.

In order to exploit its inherent (and often hidden) knowledge for improving business processes the application of data mining technology is the only way for reaching good and efficient results, as opposed to purely manual and interactive data exploration. This paper reports the first steps of a project initiated at Swiss Life for mining its data resources from the life insurance business. Based on the Data Warehouse MASY collecting all relevant data from the OLTP systems for the processing of private life insurance contracts, a Data Mining environment is set up which integrates a palette of tools for automatic data analysis, in particular machine learning approaches.

Due to these characteristics, water distribution companies face the problem of data and knowledge integration related with control and optimal exploitation. A few European and International RTD projects are currently focused on the design and development of a next generation system to support the control, optimal operation and decision support of drinking water distribution networks. In the context of a two year RTD project - WATERNET*, an evolutionary knowledge capture for advanced supervision of water distribution network is being developed. The WATERNET system, assists the distributed control of water management network to minimize the costs of exploitation, guarantee the continuous supply of water with a better quality monitoring, save energy consumption and minimize natural resources waste. This system comprises of several subsystems: a distributed information management subsystem, a machine learning subsystem, an optimization subsystem, a water quality monitoring subsystem, a simulation subsystem, and a supervision system that integrates these subsystems in order to assist the decision making and optimal operation of the network. This paper first provides a high level global description of this on going research on water management system. Then, it concentrates on the current stage of development on two specific subsystems in the project; the distributed information management and the machine learning subsystems.

This paper presents IDL, a prototypical intelligent digital library service. IDL addresses both the problems mentioned above and proposes a solution for them: The former, by integrating learning tools and techniques in order to make effective, efficient and economically feasible the task of capturing the information that should be stored and indexed by content in a digital library; the latter, by defining a metaquery language which answers for the interoperability of the various digital libraries to be connected.

This type of learning is exploited in animal training techniques such as ''shaping by successive approximations'', which enables trainers to gradually adjust the animal's behavior by giving strategically timed reinforcements. While this is similar in principle to reinforcement learning, the real phenomenon includes many subtle effects not considered in the machine learning literature, In addition, a good deal of domain information is utilized by an animal learning a new task; it does not start from scratch every time it learns a new behavior. For these reasons, it is not surprising that mobile robot learning algorithms have yet to approach the sophistication and robustness of animal learning. A serious attempt to model instrumental learning could prove fruitful for improving machine learning techniques. In the present paper, we develop a computational theory of shaping at a level appropriate for controlling mobile robots. The theory is based on a series of mechanisms for ''behavior editing'', in which pre-existing behaviors, either innate or previously learned, can be dramatically changed in magnitude, shifted in direction, or otherwise manipulated so as to produce new behavioral routines. We have implemented our theory on Amelia, an RWI B21 mobile robot equipped with a gripper and color video camera. We provide results from training Amelia on several tasks, all of which were constructed as variations of one innate behavior, object-pursuit.

However, there are some classes of problems where they seem to be scarcely applicable, e.g. when the solution to a given problem consists of several parts that influence each other. In that case the classic genetic operators cross-over and mutation do not work very well thus preventing a good performance. This paper describes an approach to overcome this problem by using high-level genetic operators and integrating task specific but domain independent knowledge to guide the use of these operators. The advantages of this approach are shown for learning a rule base to adapt the parameters of an image processing operator path within the SOLUTION system.

Knowledge in connectionist networks is stored in distributed internal weights. Learning algorithms based on numerical optimisation techniques can adapt these weights for a particular task (e.g., pattern classification), While in some applications it may be sufficient to rely on the generalisation capability of a network, others may require that the knowledge be available in symbolic form. It is, therefore, necessary to interpret and understand the knowledge learned by connectionist networks. One of tile major criticisms to connectionist approach, however, is that knowledge generated by neural networks is not explicitly represented in the form of rules suitable for verification or interpretation by human, i.e., they are often regarded as black boxes. In this paper, we will discuss the ability of connectionist networks to transfer the role of learning into knowledge refinement and generate rule-based explanations. It will be shown that the exchange of information between symbolic and connectionist representations is accomplished in a simple recurrent network (SRN) for the task of prediction. Preliminary results show that our method is promising with regard to explaining networks' behaviours.		Wu, XY (reprint author), UNIV ULSTER,FAC INFORMAT,JORDANSTOWN BT37 0QB,CO ANTRIM,NORTH IRELAND.

On the other hand, in the last twenty years, a genetic algorithm is attracted as one method which gives us optimal answers for search, optimization and machine learning problems. In this paper, we propose a new genetic tuning algorithm of PID parameters, in which the search area of PID parameters is reduced sharply by considering an effective parameters' area from the viewpoint of the control performance.

This method has been demonstrated for the skill of flying an aircraft in a flight simulator. Dynamic Ripple Down Rules (DRDR) has been develop for those parts of the system where it is possible for the pilot to verbalise his or her control strategy. For those parts of the flight where it is difficult or impossible for the pilot to formulate his or her strategy, Learning Dynamic Ripple Down Rules (LDRDR) has been develop to automatically produce rules from the logged data of the expert's behaviour. Parvaz has been tested using three volunteers. All the subjects were successful in creating a set of rules that can fly the aircraft through a given flight plan.

Such an approach may have merit, but only if the structures and mechanisms provided for learning are tuned to the special needs of robots. These needs are outlined, and reinforcement learning is promoted as the best starting point for fulfilling them. In order to make good on the promise of learning to the level required of mobile robots, significant enhancements are required to current formulations of reinforcement learning. The issues involved in making improvements are discussed, and a simple enhanced model of reinforcement learning is suggested as a first step in this direction.

Traditional machine learning algorithms are mainly used for deriving exact rules. In the lust decade, scientists have realized the importance of inexact discovery of knowledge with uncertainty. This paper explores the possible ways of extracting knowledge with uncertainty from observation. II presents two major categories of inexact knowledge discovery approaches: tile probabilistic approaches and the possibility approaches. Existing problems of current approaches and possible solutions are also discussed at the End of this paper.

However, in the Petri Nets we have to represent all kinds of processes by separate subnets even though the process has the same behavior of other one, Real-world knowledge often contain many parts which are similar, but not identical. This means that the total Petri Nets becomes very large. Therefore, it becomes difficult to see the similarities and the differences among the individual subnets representing similar parts. The kind of problems may be annoying for a small system, and it may be catastrophic for the description of a large-scale system. To avoid this kind of problems we propose a learning and reasoning method using Fuzzy Coloured Petri Nets (FCPN) under uncertainty. On the other hand to correct the rules of knowledge-based system hand-built classifier and empirical learning method both based on domain cheery have been proposed as machine learning methods, where there is a significant gap between the knowledge-intensive approach in the former and the virtually knowledge-free approach in the letter. To resolve such problems simultaneously we propose a hybrid learning method which is built on the top of knowledge-based Fuzzy Coloured Petri Net and Genetic Algorithms. Since we may meet the relation among rules are ambiguous in practical applications, an algorithm is presented for checking the consistency of fuzzy knowledge base. via a learning process using Genetic Algorithm, Using this method, it keeps equally amount of information, while it decrease its net size, computing time and difficulty on explanation of network, and it can provide a structured representation in which die relationship among the rules in the knowledge base is easily understood. To verify the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method, the system has been successfully applied to a medical diagnostic system.

The most effective way to achieve this goal is to build intelligent capabilities into the spacecraft themselves. Our technological vision for meeting the challenge of returning quality science through limited communication bandwidth will actually put scientists in a more direct link with the spacecraft than they have enjoyed to date. Technologies such as pattern recognition and machine learning can place a part of the scientist's awareness onboard the spacecraft to prioritize downlink or to autonomously trigger time-critical follow-up observations - particularly important in flyby missions - without ground interaction. Onboard knowledge discovery methods can be used to include candidate discoveries in each downlink for scientists' scrutiny. Such capabilities will allow scientists to quickly reprioritize missions in a much more intimate and efficient manner than is possible today. Ultimately, new classes of exploration missions will be enabled.

The four diagnostic levels consist of evaluation of signs and symptoms of the disease and ECG (electrocardiogram) at rest, sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, myocardial scintigraphy and finally coronary angiography. The diagnostic process is stepwise and the results ate interpreted hierarchically, i.e. the next step is necessary only if the results of the former an inconclusive. Because the suggestibility is possible, the results of Each step are interpreted individually and only the results of the highest step are valid. On the other hand. Machine Learning methods may be able elf objective interpretation of all available results for the same patient and in this way increase the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of each step. In the usual setting, the Machine Learning algorithms are tuned to maximize classification accuracy. In our case, the sensitivity and specificity were much more important, so we generalized the algorithms to take in account the variable misclassification costs. The costs can be tuned in order to bias the algorithms towards higher sensitivity or specificity. We conducted many experiments with four learning algorithms and different variations of our dataset (327 patients with completed diagnostic procedures). Our results show that improvements using Machine Learning techniques are reasonable and might find good we in practice.

A more objective assessment of altered motor control may be achieved by using a comprehensive protocol based on a surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity recorded from thigh and leg muscles. However, the relation between clinical and neurophysiological assessments is still unknown. In this paper we employ three different classification methods to investigate this relationship. The experimental results indicate that, if the appropriate set of sEMG features is used, the neurophysiological assessment is related to clinical findings and can be used to predict the AS. A comprehensive and objective sEMG assessment may be proven useful for the assessment of interventions and follow-up of SCI patients.

A model of the information seeking process is introduced and specialized to define text Altering. The historical development of text filtering is then reviewed and case studies of recent work are used to highlight important design characteristics of modern text filtering systems. User modeling techniques drawn from information retrieval, recommender systems, machine learning and other fields are described. The paper concludes with observations on the present state of the art and implications for future research on text filtering.

In contrast with traditional modeling methods, which are used to identify parameter values of the model with prescribed structure, machine learning tools identify the structure of the model as well. In the paper, we present LAGRAMGE, an equation discovery system that uses context free grammars to define the space of possible model structures, and can also make use of domain specific background knowledge in the form of function definitions. We use LAGRAMGE to automate the modeling of phytoplankton growth in Lake Glumsoe, Denmark. The structure of the automaticly constructed model agrees with human experts expectations. The model can be successfully used for short-term prediction bf the phytoplankton concentration.

The paper briefly describes the ML tools M5 and FORS that induce knowledge from measured data in the form of regression trees and Prolog programs, respectively. It then describes their successful application to the system identification and subsequent prediction of algal growth in the Lake of Bled, Slovenia The models were induced using some expert background knowledge in the form of data preparation, i.e. groupation and averaging throughout the strata of the lake, as the tackled domain was too complex for data mining alone. The induced (discovered) models contain structural and numeric information which helped experts to better understand the behavior of the system. The values predicted by the discovered models closely match the measured data.

(1) either the measured data are analyzed with a statistical approach and a black-box statistical model is constructed, or (2) the model is deduced from basic (physical, chemical, etc;) principles and the measured data are used to calibrate and validate the model. A combination of the both ways is used very rarely, although it could combine the benefits of both. Machine learning tools (ML), developed within the area of artificial intelligence (AI), are able to analyze a data base (perform data mining), using also some domain (expert) knowledge. As a result, ML tools can automatically, or with limited expert help, induce compact and easy to understand models from measured data. In this paper a description of the ML tool GoldHorn that induces differential or difference (algebraic) equations from measured time series data is given. Its successful application to the prediction of algae growth in the Lagoon of Venice, Italy, is also described in detail. The model was induced using some background knowledge, as the tackled domain was too complex for data mining alone. Our experiments show that for noisy and complex domains inducing difference equations models could be more effective than inducing differential equations models. The induced (discovered) difference equation model for predicting algae growth in the Lagoon contains only one difference equation in contrast to classical models which contain several differential equations. Nevertheless, the simulation and predictive accuracy of the discovered model is comparable to the best deductionistic models of the Lagoon.

Training is performed by computing gradients of a global objective function with respect to all the parameters in the system using a kind of back-propagation procedure. A complete check reading system based on these concepts is described. The system uses convolutional neural network character recognizers, combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is presently deployed commercially and reads million of checks per month.

Thus the study of inexact learning becomes necessary and important. This paper presents the inexact knowledge discovery using Fish-Net algorithm which is an inexact field learning method for inducing forecasting rules from data. The experimental results show that this method is especially useful when the data are noisy, erroneous and with missing values. The algorithm call also be applied for learning of fuzzy classification rules. It is interesting that the derived rules are capable of achieving higher prediction rates on new unseen cases compared with other exact learning methods.

The game Go is an ideal problem domain for exploring machine learning; it has simple rules but requires complex strategies to play well. All current commercial Co programs are knowledge based implementations; they utilize input feature and pattern matching along with minimax type search techniques, But the extremely high branching factor puts a limit on their capabilities, and they are very weak compared to the relative strengths of other game program like chess. In this paper, the Go-playing ACD consists of a critic network and an action network. The HDP type critic network learns to predict cumulative utility function of the current board position from training games, and, the action network chooses a next move which maximizes critics' next step cost-to-go. After about 6000 different training games against a public domain program, WALLY [1], the network (playing WHITE) began to win in some of the games and showed slow but steady improvements on test games.

Currently, NYNEX uses an expert system called MAX to aid human experts in diagnosing these faults; however, having an effective learning algorithm in place of MAX would allow easy portability between different maintenance centers, and easy updating when the phone equipment changes. We find that (i) machine learning algorithms have better accuracy than MAX, (ii) neural networks perform better than decision trees, (iii) neural network ensembles perform better than standard neural networks, (iv) knowledge-based neural networks perform better than standard neural networks, and (v) an ensemble of knowledge-based neural networks performs the best.

One direction is the application of machine learning techniques to pricing financial products, which is certainly one of the most complex issues in finance. In the literature, when the interest rate, the mean-rate of return and the volatility of the underlying asset follow general stochastic processes, the analytical selection is usually not available. Over the last two years, artificial neural nets have been applied to solve option pricing numerically. However, so far, there is no applications based on evolutionary computation in this area. In this paper, we shall illustrate how genetic algorithms (GAs), as an alternative to neural nets, can be potentially helpful in dealing with option pricing. In particular, we test the performance of basic genetic algorithms by using it to the determination of prices of European call options, whose exact solution is known from Black-Scholes option pricing theory. The solutions found by basic genetic algorithms are compared with the exact solution, and the performance of GAs is evaluated accordingly.

As the condition presented in this theorem is hard to be directly checked in practice, in this paper we give one equivalent condition, which is easier to be examined for a given specific problem. Furthermore, since the implementation of the criterion requests a large quantity of computing costs to estimate parameters for each candidate cluster number k, here we also propose a heuristic algorithm for those data from mixture populations with the same priori probabilities and equal-and-isotropic variance, which can make the number of k as small as possible by selecting reasonable k's instead of one by one to test. Preliminary experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm can save computing costs considerably.

Learning in neurofuzzy control however, is often referred to as global training with a large set of random examples and with a very low learning rate. This type of controller does not show exploratory learning behaviors. An agent-oriented approach to neurofuzzy control is introduced and illustrated in folding-legged robot locomotion and gymnastics; necessary and sufficient conditions are established for agent-oriented neurofuzzy discovery; and a theory of coordinated multiagent neurofuzzy control is analytically formulated. The analytical features bridge a gap between linear control, neurofuzzy control, adaptive learning, and exploratory learning.

This situation occurs very often in practical problems in which the environment changes over time, e.g., in financial investment problems. The well known back propagation method in artificial neural networks is not effective for such additional learning. On the other hand, the potential method, which was suggested by the authors recently, can make additional learning very easily. In this paper, the effectiveness of the potential method is shwon from a viewpoint of additional learning. Furthermore, since the rule for classification becomes more and more complex with only additional learning, some appropriate forgetting is also necessary. Examples in stock portfolio problems show that the performance of potential method increases more with additional learning and forgetting.

Twenty attributes (prenatal, perinatal and postnatal), thought to play a role in MR were utilized. The outcome variable (class), was, whether the child was retarded or not, based on the IQ score. Tree learners (C4.5, CART), rule inducers (C4.5Rules,FOCL) and a reference classifier (Naive Bayes) were the machine learning algorithms used for model building. The predictive accuracy ranged from 68.4% (FOCL) to 70.3% (Naive Bayes). CART obtained a sensitivity of 79.0% and also generated highly stable and simple trees across fifty random two-third (training), one-third (testing) partitions of the sample. The algorithms identified emotional/behavioral problem in children as a significant predictor of MR risk. Out-study shows that KDD methods hold promise in recovering useful structure from medical data.

However, it is not uncommon that one is left with data files without any description file. An example is the aftermath of a system crash; other examples are related to security problems. Manual determination of the subject of a data file can be a difficult and tedious task particularly if files are look-alike. An example is a big survey database where data files that look alike are actually related to different subjects. Two data files on the same subject will probably have similar semantic structures of attributes. We detect the similarity between two attributes. Then we create clusters of attributes to compare the similarity of the subjects of two data files. And finally a machine learning technique is used to predict the subject of unseen data files.

This paper aims to introduce an discuss the fundamental apparatus for the analysis and evaluation of information relationships. It defines and explains various relationships between information, measures for the amount and importance of information, and measures for the strength and importance of the information relationships. It demonstrates importance of the introduced relationships and measures for efficient synthesis, and shows how to apply them in the synthesis process. The analysis apparatus makes operational the famous theory of partitions and set systems of Hartmanis. While partitions and set systems enable us to model information, the relationships and measures enable us to analyze and measure information and information relationships. Bath together form a complete information modeling and analysis apparatus that can be applied in logic design, decision system design, pattern recognition, knowledge discovery, machine learning and other areas.

Decomposition is non-disjoint and multi-level. A fundamental difference in decomposition of MV functions and MV relations is discussed: the column (cofactor) pair compatibility translates to the group compatibility for functions, but not for relations. This makes the decomposition of relations more difficult. The method is especially efficient for strongly unspecified data typical for Machine Learning (ML).

From the aspect of machine learning, learning samples can be implemented as minterms in multi-valued logic. The representation, can then be decomposed into smaller blocks, resulting in a reduced problem complexity. This gives induced descriptions through structuring, or feature extraction, of a learning problem. Our approach to the decomposition is based on expressing a multi-valued function (learning problem) in terms of a Multi-valued Decision Diagram that allows the use of Don't Cares. The inclusion of Don't Cares is the emphasis for this paper since multi-valued benchmarks care characterized as having many Don't Cares.

We consider the problem where labels are subjected to random classification noise. The problem was known to be PAC-learnable via a hypothesis that consists of a polynomial number of linear thresholds (due to Blum, Frieze, Kannan, and Vempala). The question whether a hypothesis that is itself a perceptron (a single threshold function) can be found in polynomial time was open. We show that indeed, noisy perceptrons are PAC learnable with a hypothesis that is a perceptron.

End users' needs of analyses are more and more sophisticated. That is why it is necessary to set up departemental data marts from the data warehouse. Usually those data marts use OLAP architecture, offering a multidimensional view of data. There are four main categories of analysis tools : query tools. multidimensional data bases (MOLAP), relational OLAP (ROLAP) and data mining. Query foot are fight analysis tools. Multidimensional databases are databases stored In arrays table form which allows a rapid visual representation of basic consolidated data from multiple analysis viewpoints. Relational OLAP offers the same capabilities as OLAP but doesn't store any multidimensional database and interrogate the relational database directly. Among forthcoming evolutions in the decision support domain, data mining is certainly the most important. This paper's objective is to present the different dataware-housing technologies : from multidimensional analysis to data mining.

We propose a generalized KDD model for supervised training. A main step in this process, data mining, involves the creation of a classification structure that is representative of the concept classes identified in the data set. Data mining incorporates learning which may be supervised or unsupervised and often uses statistical as well as heuristic (machine learning) techniques. Previous research has shown that different supervised models perform better under certain conditions. In this paper, we tested the extent of overlap of instance classifications between five supervised models in tow real-world domains. Experimental results showed that in one domain all five models classified 75.8% of the instances identically, correct or incorrect. In the second domain, the corresponding figure was 63.3%. The amount of agreement between models can be used to help determine the nature of the domain and the applicability of a supervised learning approach. We extend the above experimental result and propose a multi-model majority rules (MR) data mining technique to learn about the nature of a given domain. We conclude with directions for future work.

In case of malfunction of the plant, we do not have any formal specification of the running process. So it is not possible to implement some classical techniques such as Expect Systems. Machine learning techniques integrated in SECAPI, combine concepts of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). The use of such a tool, allows to store past experiments which will be used later to explain new malfunctions and to induce rules that model the most frequent malfunctions.

J	Kleinberg, EM				Kleinberg, EM			An overtraining-resistant stochastic modeling method for pattern recognition	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						pattern recognition; machine learning	WEAK	We will introduce a generic approach for solving problems in pattern recognition based on the synthesis of accurate multiclass discriminators from large numbers of very inaccurate ''weak'' models through the use of discrete stochastic processes. Contrary to the standard expectation held for the many statistical and heuristic techniques normally associated with the field, a significant feature of this method of ''stochastic modeling'' is its resistance to so-called ''overtraining.'' The drop in performance of any stochastic model in going from training to test data remains comparable to that of the component weak models from which it is synthesized; and since these component models are very simple, their performance drop is small, resulting in a stochastic model whose performance drop is also small despite its high level of accuracy.

J	Gratch, J; DeJong, G				Gratch, J; DeJong, G			A statistical approach to adaptive problem solving	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Domain independent general purpose problem solving techniques are desirable from the standpoints of software engineering and human computer interaction. They employ declarative and modular knowledge representations and present a constant homogeneous interface to the user, untainted by the peculiarities of the specific domain of interest. Unfortunately, this very insulation from domain details often precludes effective problem solving behavior. General approaches have proven successful in complex real-world situations only after a tedious cycle of manual experimentation and modification. Machine learning offers the prospect of automating this adaptation cycle, reducing the burden of domain specific tuning and reconciling the conflicting needs of generality and efficacy. A principal impediment to adaptive techniques is the utility problem: even if the acquired information is accurate and is helpful in isolated cases, it may degrade overall problem solving performance under difficult to predict circumstances. We develop a formal characterization of the utility problem and introduce COMPOSER, a statistically rigorous learning approach which avoids the utility problem. COMPOSER has been successfully applied to learning heuristics for planning and scheduling systems. This article includes theoretical results and an extensive empirical evaluation. The approach is shown to outperform significantly several other leading approaches to the utility problem.

J	Gildea, D; Jurafsky, D				Gildea, D; Jurafsky, D			Learning bias and phonological-rule induction	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article								A fundamental debate in the machine learning of language has been the role of prior knowledge in the learning process. Purely nativist approaches, such as the Principles and Parameters model, build parameterized linguistic generalizations directly into the learning system. Purely empirical approaches use a general, domain-independent learning rule (Error Back-Propagation, Instance-based Generalization, Minimum Description Length) to learn linguistic generalizations directly from the data. In this paper we suggest that an alternative to the purely nativist or purely empiricist learning paradigms is to represent the prior knowledge of language as it set of abstract learning biases, which guide an empirical inductive learning algorithm. We test our idea by examining the machine learning of simple Sound Pattern of English (SPE)-style phonological rules. We represent phonological rules as finite-state transducers that accept underlying forms as input and generate surface forms as output. We show that OSTIA, a general-purpose transducer induction algorithm, was incapable of learning simple phonological rules like flapping. We then augmented OSTIA with three kinds of learning biases that are specific to natural language phonology, and that are assumed explicitly or implicitly by every theory of phonology: faithfulness (underlying segments tend to be realized similarly on the surface), community (similar segments behave similarly), and context (phonological rules need access to variables in their context). These biases are so fundamental to generative phonology that they are left implicit in many theories. But explicitly modifying the OSTIA algorithm with these biases allowed it to learn move compact, accurate, and general transducers, and our implementation successfully learns a number of rules from English and German. Furthermore, we show that some of the remaining errors in our augmented model are dire to implicit biases in the traditional SPE-style rewrite system that are not similarly represented in the transducer formalism, suggesting that while transducers may be formally equivalent to SPE-style rules, they may not have identical evaluation procedures. Because our biases were applied to the learning of very simple SPE-style rules, and to a non-psychologically-motivated and nonprobabilistic theory of purely deterministic transducers, we do not expect that our model as implemented has any practical use as a phonological learning device, nor is it intended as a cognitive model of human learning. Indeed, because of the noise and nondeterminism inherent to linguistic data, we feel strongly that stochastic algorithms for language induction are much more likely to be a fruitful research direction. Our model is rather intended to suggest the kind of biases that may be added to other empiricist induction models, and the way in which they may be added, in order to build a cognitively and computationally plausible learning model for phonological rules.

A major drawback of its application is the need to input a large amount of data and the necessity to estimate values on a rather subjective basis in order to complete the House of Quality. This data is plentiful and often designers lack the knowledge with satisfying accuracy. This paper suggests a machine learning approach in which a neural network automatically determines the data by learning from examples. Unlike conventional neural networks which are treated as ''black boxes'', the topology and the weight values are not random but represent real circumstances and call. directly be interpreted in the terms of the application. A final section discusses problems arising from the small number of training sets which is usually available in the field of product design.

This paper. proposes an Interactive Inductive Learning System (IILS) which can use background knowledge provided by experts to avoid incorrect or incomplete induced heuristics. Through the specification of guidance relations, the expert can force the rule-induction system to focus on a subset of relevant attributes and training instances. A guidance relation consists of a set of attribute constraints, where each constraint instructs IILS on the role of an attribute for the induction of a concept. IILS has been linked to the database of an Environmental Evaluation Support System (EESS) for the induction of impact estimation and comparison heuristics. The induced heuristics are generalizations of past assessments stored in the database and permit the prediction of impact levels for cases not previously encountered by EESS. The integration of IILS transforms EESS into an environmental impact assessment learning apprentice system capable of acquiring and improving evaluation heuristics through its normal use.

J	Dybala, T; Tecuci, G; Rezazad, H				Dybala, T; Tecuci, G; Rezazad, H			The shared expertise model for teaching interactive design assistants (Reprinted from Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence)	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Reprint						computer engineering; engineering design; configuration problems; intelligent design assistants; apprenticeship learning; multistrategy learning; plausible version space	KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; REPRESENTATION; SYSTEMS; BASE	The growing complexity of contemporary engineering designs requires the use of sophisticated computer-based design tools. Such tools increase productivity in drafting, configuration and calculations. However the current generation of design tools plays a rather passive role in the entire design process. Recent progress in knowledge-based engineering design, machine learning and knowledge acquisition allows the development of knowledge-based design assistants which could behave as active partners to human designers, rather than as passive graphical or computational tools. This paper presents the shared expertise model (SEM) of interaction between a human designer and a knowledge-based design assistant, in which the design assistant behaves as an apprentice and a collaborator in the design process. The human designer and his computer-based assistant create designs together with the assistant proposing routine or even innovative designs, and the human designer correcting and finalizing these designs, as well as specifying creative designs. In this process, the assistant also learns from the human designer, constantly extending and improving its knowledge base, and becoming a better design assistant. This is achieved by employing apprenticeship multistrategy learning based on a plausible version space representation. Within the SEM framework, a human designer with limited programming capabilities can directly develop and maintain a personalized knowledge-based design assistant. The use of SEM leads to increased capabilities of the expert-assistant design team, In this paper some of the main features of the SEM model, as well as its implementation with the Disciple toolkit, are illustrated within the domain of computer workstation configuration.

Researchers in many different fields have shown great interest in data mining. Several emerging applications in information providing services, such as data warehousing and on-line services over the Internet, also call for various data mining techniques to better understand user behavior, to improve the service provided, and to increase the business opportunities. In response to such a demand, this article is to provide a survey, from a database researcher's point of view, on the data mining techniques developed recently. A classification of the available data mining techniques is provided, and a comparative study of such techniques is presented.

J	Shen, WM; Leng, B				Shen, WM; Leng, B			A metapattern-based automated discovery loop for integrated data mining - Unsupervised learning of relational patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						induction; deduction; human interaction; integration; unsupervised learning; relational concepts; metaquery; metapattern		Metapattern (also known as metaquery) is a new approach for integrated data mining systems. Different from a typical ''tool-box'' like integration, where components must be picked and chosen by users without much help, metapatterns provide a common representation for intercomponent communication as well as a human interface for hypothesis development and search control. One weakness of this approach, however, is that the task of generating fruitful metapatterns is still a heavy burden for human users. In this paper, we describe a metapattern generator and an integrated discovery loop that can automatically generate metapatterns. Experiments in both artificial and real-world databases have shown that this new system goes beyond the existing machine learning technologies, and can discover relational patterns without requiring humans to prelabel the data as positive or negative examples for some given target concepts. With this technology, future data mining systems could discover high-quality, human comprehensible knowledge in a much more efficient and focused manner, and data mining could be managed easily by both expert and less expert users.

J	Bruha, I; Franek, F				Bruha, I; Franek, F			Comparison of various routines for unknown attribute value processing: The covering paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; rule induction; unknown attribute value processing; matching		Simple inductive learning algorithms assume that all attribute values are available. The well-known Quinlan's paper(1) discusses quite a few routines for the processing of unknown attribute values in the TDIDT family and analyaes seven of them. This paper introduces five routines for the processing of unknown attribute values that have been designed for the CN4 learning algorithm, a large extension of the well-known CN2. Both algorithms CN2 and CN4 induce lists of decision rules from examples applying the covering paradigm. CN2 offers two ways for the processing of unknown attribute values. The CN4's five routines differ in style of matching complexes with examples (objects) that involve unknown attribute values. The definition of matching is discussed in detail in the paper. The strategy of unknown value processing is described both for learning and classification phases in individual routines. The results of experiments with various percentages of unknown attribute values on real-world (mostly medical) data are presented and performances of all five routines are compared.

A partition triple is defined for such a table as a triple of partitions on the set of examples, the set of attributes, and the set of attribute values, respectively, preserving the structure of a table. The idea of a partition triple is an extension of the idea of a partition pair, introduced by J. Hartmanis and J. Steams in automata theory. Results characterizing partition triples and algorithms for computing partition triples are presented. The theory is illustrated by an example of an application in machine learning from examples.

J	Lehto, MR; Sorock, GS				Lehto, MR; Sorock, GS			Machine learning of motor vehicle accident categories from narrative data	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						narrative text; Bayesian methods; epidemiology	PREVENTION; SYSTEM	Bayesian inferencing as a machine learning technique was evaluated for identifying pre-crash activity and crash type from accident narratives describing 3,686 motor vehicle crashes. It was hypothesized that a Bayesian model could learn from a computer search for 63 keywords related to accident categories. Learning was described in terms of the ability to accurately classify previously unclassifiable narratives not containing the original keywords. When narratives contained keywords, the results obtained using both the Bayesian model and keyword search corresponded closely to expert ratings (P(detection) greater than or equal to 0.9, and P(false positive)less than or equal to 0.05). For narratives not containing keywords, when the threshold used by the Bayesian model was varied between p>0.5 and p>0.9, the overall probability of detecting a category assigned by the expert varied between 67% and 12%. False positives correspondingly varied between 32% and 3%. These latter results demonstrated that the Bayesian system learned from the results of the keyword searches.

We use an interaction model based on orthogonal functions, and give a result on independence properties in this model. Using this result we develop an efficient approximation algorithm for estimating the parameters in a given undirected model. To find the best model, we use a heuristic search algorithm in which the structure is determined incrementally. We also give an algorithm for reconstructing the causal directions, if such exist.

J	Yuan, YF; Zhuang, HJ				Yuan, YF; Zhuang, HJ			A genetic algorithm for generating fuzzy classification rules	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy classification; machine learning; genetic algorithm	SYSTEMS; LOGIC	Fuzzy classification systems based on fuzzy logic are capable of dealing with cognitive uncertainties such as vagueness and ambiguity involved in classification problems. To build a fuzzy classification system, the key is to find an optimal set of fuzzy rules. Machine learning methods such as fuzzy neural networks and fuzzy decision tree induction have been applied to learn fuzzy rules but they may be trapped into local optimal. Based on the principle of natural evolution and global searching, a genetic algorithm is promising in obtaining better results but it is usually less efficient. In this paper, a Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (FGA) is developed to generate fuzzy classification rules. Several techniques such as multivalue logic coding, composite fitness function, viability check, and rule extraction are used to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the algorithm. Two experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of FGA and to compare FGA with other machine learning algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a general learning method as a framework for automatically deriving membership functions and fuzzy if-then rules from a set of given training examples to rapidly build a prototype fuzzy expert system. Based on the membership functions and the fuzzy rules derived, a corresponding fuzzy inference procedure to process inputs is also developed.

The system, in its most general form, can be applied to any inductive machine-learning problem: given a database of examples, the system will return a general description applicable to examples both within and outside the database. This differs from traditional genetic algorithms, which perform optimization. The genetic algorithm system is compared to an established neural network system in the domain of financial forecasting, using the results from over 1600 stocks and roughly 5000 experiments. Synergy between the two systems is also examined.		Mahfoud, S (reprint author), LBS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INC,311 PK PL BLVD,SUITE 330,CLEARWATER,FL 34619, USA.						Bauer R.

Existing inductive machine learning (ML) systems such us NewId, CN2, C4.5 and AQ15 learn from past case histories using symbolic and/or numeric values. These systems learn symbolic rules (IF... THEN like) which link an antecedent set of clinical factors to a consequent class or decision. This paper compares the learning performance of alternative ML systems with each other and with respect to a novel approach using logic minimization, called LML, to learn from data. Patient cases were taken from the archives of the Paediatric Surgery Clinic of the University Hospital of Crete, Heraklion, Greece. Comparison of ML system performance is based both on classification accuracy and on informal expert assessment of learned knowledge.

J	Gouws, FS; Aldrich, C				Gouws, FS; Aldrich, C			Rule-based characterization of industrial flotation processes with inductive techniques and genetic algorithms	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							FROTH SURFACES; CLASSIFICATION	By making use of machine learning techniques, the features of notation froths and other plant variables can be used as a basis for the development of knowledge-based systems for plant monitoring and control. Probabilistic induction and genetic algorithms were used to classify different froth structures from industrial copper and platinum flotation plants, as well as recoveries from a phosphate notation plant. Both algorithms were equally capable of classifying the different froths at least as well as a human expert. The genetic algorithm performed significantly better than the inductive algorithm but required more tuning before optimum results could be obtained. The classification rules produced by both algorithms can easily be incorporated into a supervisory expert system shell or decision support system for plant operators and could consequently make a significant impact on the way notation plants are currently being controlled.

On the other hand, most inductive learning methods require a small number of attribute values. Thus it is necessary to convert input data sets with continuous attributes into input data sets with discrete attributes. Methods of discretization restricted to single continuous attributes will be called local, while methods that simultaneously convert all continuous attributes will be called global. in this paper, a method of transforming any local discretization method into a global one is presented. A global discretization method, based on cluster analysis is presented and compared experimentally with three known local methods, transformed into global. Experiments include tenfold cross-validation and leaving-one-out methods for ten real-life data sets. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Amin, A; Sammut, C; Sum, KC				Amin, A; Sammut, C; Sum, KC			Learning to recognize hand-printed Chinese characters using inductive logic programming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Letter						Chinese characters; dominant point; feature extraction; Hough transform; machine learning; structural approach	HANDWRITTEN	Recognition of Chinese characters has been a major interest of researchers for many years, and a large number of research papers and reports have already been published in this area. There are several major problems: Chinese characters are distinct and ideographic, the character size is very large and a lot of structurally similar characters exist in the character set. Thus, classification criteria are difficult to find. This paper presents a new technique for the recognition of hand-printed Chinese characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variations in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are twofold: it can generalize over the large degree of variations between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example. The paper also describes three methods of feature extraction for Chinese character recognition: regular expression, dominant point and modified Hough transform. These methods are then compared in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Both techniques use statistical models on the structural representation of digit images. Skeleton images are adopted to produce fuzzy rules based on the ID3 approach, and contour images are used for the Markov chain based approach. Decision trees produced from the ID3 algorithm are converted to a set of simplified rules which are then fuzzified into a set of fuzzy rules. To retain the classification performance, a two-layer perceptron is applied to optimize defuzzification parameters. On the other hand, a digit contour is traversed in a well-defined order and the Markov chain is used to perform sequential analysis and to match with models. The two classifiers are then combined to complement each other using a three-layer perceptron. The combined classifier achieves a good classification performance and at the same time it overcomes the difficulties in a conventional syntactic approach for handwritten character recognition, such as the scaling problem and lack of machine learning ability. Experimental results on NIST Special Database 3 show that the combined classifier has a significantly improved performance in terms of substitution versus rejection rates. After about 15% of digits that cannot be classified with high confidence by the combined classifier are re-classified by a nearest neighbor classifier using optimized prototypes, the overall classification rate can be as high as 98.6% without rejection.

We compare the prognostic accuracy and the explanation ability of different classifiers. Among the different algorithms the semi-naive Bayesian classifier and Assistant-R seem to be the most appropriate. We analyze the combination of decisions of several classifiers for solving prediction problems and show that the combined classifier improves both performance and the explanation ability.

Concept formation is a machine learning technique that summarizes known examples/cases in the form of a tree. After the tree is constructed, it can then be used to predict the classification of new cases. Logistic regression, on the other hand, is a statistical model that allows for a quantitative relationship for a dichotomous event with several independent variables. The outcome (dependent) variable must have only two choices, e.g. does or does not occur, alive or dead, etc. The result of this model is an equation which is then used to predict the probability of class membership of a new case. The two models were evaluated on a trauma registry database composed of information on all trauma patients admitted in 1992 to a Level I trauma center. A total of 2155 records, representing all trauma patients admitted for more than 24 h or who died in the Emergency Department, were grouped into two databases as follows: (1) discharge status of 'died' (containing 151 records), and (2) any discharge status other than 'died' (containing 2004 records). Both databases contained the same variables.

J	Muggleton, S; Michie, D				Muggleton, S; Michie, D			Machine intelligibility and the duality principle	BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article							BUSINESS; AGENTS	The scale and diversity of net-worked sources of delta and computer programs is rapidly swamping human abilities to digest and even locate relevant information. The high speed of computing has compounded this problem by the generation of even, larger amounts of data, derived in ways that are generally opaque to human users. The result is an increasing gulf between human and computer abilities. Society's ever more wide-scale dependence on rapidly growing networked sources of software threatens severe breakdowns if machine intelligibility issues are not given high priority. We argue that lack of machine intelligibility in human/computer interactions can be traced directly to present approaches to software design. According to the duality principle in this paper, software involved in human/computer interaction should contain two distinct layers - a declarative knowledge-level layer and a lower-level functional or procedural-knowledge layer. This extends the formal methods separation of specification and implementation by requiring that the declarative layer be capable of extensive human interrogation at run time. The declarative layer should support simple deductive and inductive inference. The ease with which declarative knowledge can be translated to natural language could be used to provide a human-comprehensible 'window' into the properties of the underlying functional layer. Adaptation of the declarative knowledge in response to human interaction could be supported by modern machine-learning mechanisms. In addition, declarative knowledge could be used to facilitate human-comprehensible communication between programs. Existing well-developed technologies can be commandeered to implement the declarative layer The obvious language of choice is pure Prolog, augmented with machine-learning mechanisms based on inductive logic programming, The underlying functional layer would be composed of normal procedurally encoded computer programs. It is argued that the duality principle in software design is a necessity for dealing with the demands of wide-scale computer usage in the information age and should be an urgent goal for computer science research at the start of the 21st century.

J	Mareschal, D; Shultz, TR				Mareschal, D; Shultz, TR			Generative connectionist networks and constructivist cognitive development	COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS	This article presents a novel computational framework for modeling cognitive development. The new modeling paradigm provides a language with which to compare and contrast radically different facets of children's knowledge. Concepts from the study of machine learning are used to explore the power of connectionist networks that construct their own architectures during learning. These so-called generative algorithms are shown to escape from Fodor's (1980) critique of constructivist development We describe one generative connectionist algorithm (cascade-correlation) in detail. We report on the successful use of the algorithm to model cognitive development on balance scale phenomena; seriation; the integration of velocity, time, and distance cues; prediction of effect sizes from magnitudes of causal potencies and effect resistances; and the acquisition of English personal pronouns. The article demonstrates that computer models are invaluable for illuminating otherwise obscure discussions.

J	Zhong, N; Ohsuga, S				Zhong, N; Ohsuga, S			A hierarchical model learning approach for refining and managing concept clusters discovered from databases	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						knowledge discovery in databases; multi-layer logic; machine learning; information theory; hierarchical modeling; refinement; management	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; INDUCTION; SYSTEMS; RULES	The contents of most databases are ever-changing, and erroneous data can be a significant problem in real-world databases. Therefore, the process of discovering knowledge from databases is a process based on incipient hypothesis generation/evaluation and refinement/management. Although many systems for knowledge discovery in databases have been proposed, most systems have not addressed the capabilities of refining/managing the discovered knowledge. This paper describes a hierarchical model learning approach for refining/managing concept clusters discovered from databases. This approach is the basic one for developing HML (Hierarchical Model Learning), which is one sub-system of our GLS (Global Learning Scheme) discovery system and can be cooperatively used with other sub-systems of GLS such as DBI (Decomposition Based Induction). By means of HML, concept clusters discovered from a database by DBI can be represented as the Multi-Layer Logic formulae with hierarchical models in a knowledge-base and can be easily refined/managed according to data change in a database and/or domain knowledge. HML is based on the model representation of Multi-Layer Logic (MLL). Its key feature is the quantitative evaluation for selecting the best representation of the MLL formulae by using cooperatively a criterion based on information theory and domain knowledge. Experience with a prototype of HML implemented by the knowledge-based system KAUS is discussed.

J	Chan, KC				Chan, KC			A comparative study of the MAX and SUM machine-learning algorithms using virtual fuzzy sets	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						fuzzy systems; adaptive clustering; adaptive control; adaptive prediction; fuzzy control; system identification; system modeling	DYNAMIC-SYSTEMS; IDENTIFICATION	Thispaper presents an adaptive fuzzy learning algorithm for non-linear system identification. The algorithm is based on a concept called a ''virtual fuzzy set''. The concept provides a new representation for the consequent part of a fuzzy production rule. A virtual fuzzy set, which consists of two consecutive fuzzy sets with different degrees of membership, is an imaginary fuzzy set located at a location most appropriate far a numerical training data point. The aim of virtual fuzzy set is to increase the system accuracy, at minimum expense in terms of computer resources. The concept is incorporated into a one-pass build-up adaptive algorithm for non-linear system identification. The results show that better performance can be achieved, compared with traditional fuzzy sets. Two variations of the learning algorithm, using the MAX or SUM of rule degrees, are proposed. The performance of these two approaches in identifying processes with different noise levels is evaluated.

Sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, it takes advantage of the ongoing testing conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) to estimate the true error of models that have been applied to make prospective predictions on previously untested, noncongeneric-chemical substances. The PTE project first identifies a group of standardized NTP chemical bioassays either scheduled to be conducted or are ongoing, but not yet complete. The project then announces and advertises the evaluation experiment, disseminates information about the chemical bioassays, and encourages researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to publish their predictions in peer-reviewed journals, using whatever approaches and methods they feel are best. A collection of such papers is published in this Environmental Health Perspectives Supplement, providing readers the opportunity to compare and contrast PT approaches and models, within the context of their prospective application to an actual-use situation. This introduction to this collection of papers on predictive toxicology summarizes the predictions made and the final results obtained for the 44 chemical carcinogenesis bioassays of the first PTE experiment (PTE-1) and presents information that identifies the 30 chemical carcinogenesis bioassays of PTE-2, along with a table of prediction sets that have been published to date. It also provides background about the origin and goals of the PTE project. outlines the special challenge associated with estimating the true error of models that aspire to predict open-system behavior, and summarizes what has been learned to date.

J	King, RD; Srinivasan, A				King, RD; Srinivasan, A			Prediction of rodent carcinogenicity bioassays from molecular structure using inductive logic programming	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						machine learning; artificial intelligence; SAR; National Toxicology Program	NATIONAL-TOXICOLOGY-PROGRAM; AUTOMATED STRUCTURE EVALUATION; CHEMICAL-STRUCTURE; DIHYDROFOLATE-REDUCTASE; 44 CHEMICALS; NEURAL NETWORKS; MUTAGENICITY; INHIBITION; QSAR; NTP	The machine learning program Progol was applied to the problem of forming the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for a set of compounds tested for carcinogenicity in rodent bioassays by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP). Progol is the first inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithm to use a fully relational method for describing chemical structure in SARs, based on using atoms and their bond connectivities. Progol is well suited to forming SARs for carcinogenicity as it is designed to produce easily understandable rules (structural alerts) for sets of noncongeneric compounds. The Progol SAR method was tested by prediction of a set of compounds that have been widely predicted by other SAR methods (the compounds used in the NTP's first round of carcinogenesis predictions). For these compounds no method (human or machine) was significantly more accurate than Progol. Progol was the most accurate method that did not use data from biological tests on rodents (however, the difference in accuracy is not significant). The Progol predictions were based solely on chemical structure and the results of tests for Salmonella mutagenicity. Using the full NTP database, the prediction accuracy of Progol was estimated to be 63% (+/-3%) using 5-fold cross validation. A set of structural alerts for carcinogenesis was automatically generated and the chemical rationale for them investigated-these structural alerts are statistically independent of the Salmonella mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity is predicted for the compounds used in the NTP's second round of carcinogenesis predictions. The results for prediction of carcinogenesis, taken together with the previous successful applications of predicting mutagenicity in nitroaromatic compounds, and inhibition of angiogenesis by suramin analogues, show that Progol has a role to play in understanding the SARs of cancer-related compounds.

The approach, referred to as INSTRUCT, builds on two well-known techniques, reconstructive modeling and model tracing, at the same time avoiding their major pitfalls. INSTRUCT does not require prior empirical knowledge of student errors and is also neutral with respect to pedagogy and reasoning strategies applied by the student. Pedagogical actions and the student model are generated on-line, which allows for dynamic adaptation of instruction, problem generation and immediate feedback on student's errors. Furthermore, the approach is not only incremental but truly active, since it involves students in explicit dialogues about problem-solving decisions. Student behaviour is used as a source of information for user modeling and to compensate for the unreliability of the student model. INSTRUCT uses both implicit information about the steps the student performed or the explanations he or she asked for, and explicit information gained from the student's answers to direct question about operations being performed. Domain knowledge and the user model are used to focus the search on the portion of the problem space the student is likely to traverse while solving the problem at hand. The approach presented is examined in the context of SINT, an ITS for the domain of symbolic integration.

J	Chang, KH; Raman, R; Carlisle, WH; Cross, JH				Chang, KH; Raman, R; Carlisle, WH; Cross, JH			A self-improving helpdesk service system using case-based reasoning techniques	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						case-based reasoning; machine learning; expert system; artificial intelligence; helpdesk service automation		Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is the process of solving a given problem based on the knowledge gained from solving precedents. It is an effective technique in the area of customer services or helpdesks. That is, a CBR system is used to solve most of the commonly occurring customer problems. While the implementation techniques may vary, most CBR systems include the following five steps: case representation and storage, precedent matching and retrieval, adaptation of the retrieved solution, validation of the solution, and finally, casebase update to include the information gained from the new problem. This paper details the various implementation techniques for these five steps, while focusing on a particular helpdesk system, namely SmartUSA, developed for the Union Camp Corporation. This system solves a customer's problem by filtering the problem description through an alias table to generate a brief description and then matching the brief description with the cases in the database. It has proved to be an effective and user-friendly system that has successfully handled different descriptions of the same problem and allowed for the casebase to be built in free-format (plain) text. This system has significantly reduced the workload and the response time in the customer services department of the Union Camp Corporation.

J	Esfandiari, B; Deflandre, G; Quinqueton, J; Dony, C				Esfandiari, B; Deflandre, G; Quinqueton, J; Dony, C			Agent-oriented techniques for network supervision	ANNALES DES TELECOMMUNICATIONS-ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						telecommunication network; supervision; artificial intelligence; network management; time series; computer aid; temporal logic; machine learning		This paper presents the results of the Reseau fute (smart net) project, the goal of which is to use distributed AI and multi-agent techniques for network management and supervision. More precisely, these techniques have been applied to the partial automation of the dynamic processing (what is known about a net work is always incomplete and can change at any time) of alarms and of various event notifications received by network management platforms. The system that we propose is able for example to automatically handle some alarms or to filter events of no-interest for a given operator. To achieve this goal, an assistant, or interface agent according to the model proposed by Patti Maes [MK93], has been realized. The goal of the assistant is first to learn, by observation, the behavior of the network supervision operator and second to reproduce such a behavior when the conditions in which the behavior has been learned are detected again. The learned information are stored using chronicles [Gha94]. A chronicle is a data-structure allowing programmers to represent sequences of events while taking temporal knowledge into account. Our assistant has been implemented and tested within Magenta which is a program, written in Smalltalk, that simulates (in a simplified way) a network management platform. This program respects roughly the GDMO and CMIS standards.

J	Turney, P				Turney, Peter			How to Shift Bias: Lessons from the Baldwin Effect	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Bias; instinct; bias shift; Baldwin effect; concept learning; induction		An inductive learning algorithm takes a set of data as input and generates a hypothesis as output. A set of data is typically consistent with an infinite number of hypotheses; therefore, there must be factors other than the data that determine the output of the learning algorithm. In machine learning, these other factors are called the bias of the learner. Classical learning algorithms have a fixed bias, implicit in their design. Recently developed learning algorithms dynamically adjust their bias as they search for a hypothesis. Algorithms that shift bias in this manner are not as well understood as classical algorithms. In this paper, we show that the Baldwin effect has implications for the design and analysis of bias shifting algorithms. The Baldwin effect was proposed in 1896 to explain how phenomena that might appear to require Lamarckian evolution (inheritance of acquired characteristics) can arise from purely Darwinian evolution. Hinton and Nowlan presented a computational model of the Baldwin effect in 1987. We explore a variation on their model, which we constructed explicitly to illustrate the lessons that the Baldwin effect has for research in bias shifting algorithms. The main lesson is that it appears that a good strategy for shift of bias in a learning algorithm is to begin with a weak bias and gradually shift to a strong bias.

Problem solving and learning in NOOS are modelled by means of concepts, tasks, methods and metalevels. Metalevels allow NOOS to reason about own problem solving. Using metalevels, NOOS can reason about preferences in order to make decisions about sets of alternatives present in domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge. Reflection in NOOS is provided by inference processes that involve metalevels. Basic reflective capabilities include reasoning about alternative methods to solve a task, reasoning about what is known by the system itself, and reasoning about the existence of solutions. A formal model of NOOS inference using Descriptive Dynamic Logic is also presented.

J	Furnkranz, J				Furnkranz, J			Machine learning in computer chess: The next generation	ICCA JOURNAL			English	Article							EXPERIENCE; CHUNKING; PROGRAM	Ten years ago the ICCA Journal published an overview of machine-learning approaches to computer chess (Skiena, 1986). The author's results were rather pessimistic. In particular he concluded that ''with the exception of rote learning in the opening book, few results have trickled into competitive programs'' and that ''there appear no research projects on the horizon offering reason for optimism.'' In this paper we will update Skiena's work with research that has been conducted in this area since the publication of his paper. By doing so we hope to show that at least Skiena's second conclusion is no longer valid.

J	Liu, WZ				Liu, WZ			An integrated approach for different attribute types in nearest neighbour classification	KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW			English	Article							DECISION TREE INDUCTION	The basic nearest neighbour algorithm works by storing the training instances and classifying a new case by predicting that it has the same class as its nearest stored instance. To measure the distance between instances, some distance metric needs to be used. In situations when all attributes have numeric values, the conventional nearest neighbour method treats examples as points in feature spaces and uses Euclidean distance as the distance metric. In tasks with only nominal attributes, the simple ''over-lap'' metric is usually used. To handle classification tasks that have mixed types of attributes, the two different metrics are simply combined. Work by researchers in the machine learning field has shown that this approach performs poorly. This paper attempts to study a more recently developed distance metric and show that this metric is capable of measuring the importance of different attributes. With the use of discretisation for numeric-valued attributes, this method provides an integrated way in dealing with problem domains with mixtures of attribute types. Through detailed analyses, this paper tries to provide further insights into the understanding of nearest neighbour classification techniques and promote further use of this type of classification algorithm.

J	AbdelAal, RE; Mangoud, AM				AbdelAal, RE; Mangoud, AM			Abductive machine learning for modeling and predicting the educational score in school health surveys	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						machine learning; abductive networks; modeling; prediction; educational performance; school health surveys		The use of modern abductive machine learning techniques is described for modeling and predicting outcome parameters in terms of input parameters in medical survey data. The AIM(R) (Abductory Induction Mechanism) abductive network machine-learning tool is used to model the educational score in a health survey of 2,720 Albanian primary school children. Data included the child's age, gender, vision, nourishment, parasite infection, family size, parents' education, and educational score. Models synthesized by training on just 100 cases predict the educational score output for the remaining 2,620 cases with 100% accuracy. Simple models represented as analytical functions highlight global relationships and trends in the survey population. Models generated are quite robust, with no change in the basic model structure for a 10-fold increase in the size of the training set. Compared to other statistical and neural network approaches, AIM provides faster and highly automated model synthesis, requiring little or no user intervention.

J	Bartfai, G				Bartfai, G			An ART-based modular architecture for learning hierarchical clusterings	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						adaptive resonance theory; self-organization; hierarchical clustering; machine learning; zoo database	NEURAL NETWORK; PATTERNS; MAPS	This paper introduces a neural architecture (HART for ''Hierarchical ART'') that is capable of learning hierarchical clusterings of arbitrary input sequences, The network is built up of layers of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) network modules where each layer learns to cluster the prototypes developed at the layer directly below it. The notion of effective vigilance is introduced to refer to the vigilance level of multiple ART modules in a HART network. An upper bound is derived for the number of HART layers needed in the case when all ART modules have the same vigilance. Experiments were carried out on a machine learning benchmark database to demonstrate the developed internal representation as well as some learning properties of two- and three-layer binary HART networks.

J	Hirst, JD				Hirst, JD			Nonlinear quantitative structure-activity relationship for the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by pyrimidines	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; DRUG DESIGN; COMBINATORIAL TECHNOLOGIES; TRIMETHOPRIM; BINDING; 2,4-DIAMINO-5-(SUBSTITUTED-BENZYL)PYRIMIDINES; DISCOVERY; SHAPE	A novel method for quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis is presented. The method, which does not assume any particular functional form for the QSAR, develops nonlinear relationships between parameters describing a set of molecules and the activity of the molecules. For the QSAR of the inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase by 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted benzyl)pyrimidines, the method compares favorably to other nonlinear methods. Cross-validation trials demonstrate that the predictive ability is as accurate as other methods, and the method is simpler and faster than neural network and machine-learning methods. Consequently, its implementation is much easier, and interpretation of the generated QSAR is more straightforward.

J	Urbanczik, R				Urbanczik, R			A large committee machine learning noisy rules	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							STORAGE CAPACITY; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; NEURAL NETWORKS	Statistical mechanics is used to study generalization in a tree committee machine with K hidden units and continuous weights trained on examples generated by a teacher of the same structure but corrupted by noise. The corruption is due to additive gaussian noise applied in the input layer or the hidden layer of the teacher. In the large K limit the generalization error epsilon(g) as function of alpha, the number of patterns per adjustable parameter, shows a qualitatively similar behavior for the two cases: It does not approach its optimal value and is nonmonotonic if training is done at zero temperature. This remains true even when replica symmetry breaking is taken into account. Training at a fixed positive temperature leads, within the replica symmetric theory, to an alpha(-k) decay of epsilon(g) toward its optimal value. The value of k is calculated and found to depend on the model of noise. By scaling the temperature with alpha, the value of k can be increased to an optimal value k(opt). However, at one step of replica symmetry breaking at a fixed positive temperature epsilon(g) decays as alpha(-kopt). So, although epsilon(g) will approach its optimal value with increasing sample size for any fixed K, the convergence is only uniform in K when training at a positive temperature.

A tree-based machine learning algorithm (PREDICTOR) was applied to this database, in order to attempt to find rules which would classify patients into 2 groups, i.e., those suffering from gastric or oesophageal cancer, and the remainder. The results were encouraging. The cross-validated classification performance figures showed that, by classifying 61.3% of the patients as high risk, a sensitivity of 94.9% and a specificity of 39.8% could be achieved. It is planned to construct an expert system based on the rules produced by the machine learning algorithm, in order to provide preliminary screening for cancer in dyspeptic patients.

Various rule-sets were induced that recommended particular CSP chiral selectors based on the structural features of an enantiomer pair. The results suggest that the accuracy of the optimal rule-set is 63% +/- 3%, which is more than ten times greater than the accuracy that would have resulted from a random choice.

This is a problem of practical economic significance as each missed opportunity for artificial insemination results in 21 days lost milk production. Classifications were made on normalised deviations of milk volume production and milking order time series data. The best learning scheme was C4.5, which detected 69% of oestrus events, albeit with an unacceptably high rate of ''false positives'' (74%). Further work based on the use of a progesterone assay to provide a more accurate oestrus reference is suggested, along with the inclusion of more monitored variables and an analysis of their relative contributions to the learning process.

To meet this objective, in this paper, an automated decision support system is described. This system consists of several distributed decision-makers, and uses the concept learning scheme using neural networks. The system has the capability to find a suboptimal solution without interrupting the actual operations, in order to deal with various constraints. Simulation studies show that the proposed scheduling strategy works rather more efficiently than the current ATC procedures based on fixed heuristic rules.

Sensitivity analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIO-MEDICAL COMPUTING			English	Article						anesthesia; inductive machine learning; intelligent alarm systems; mathematical modeling; mechanical ventilation; respiratory mechanics		In an earlier study an approach was described to generate intelligent alarm systems for monitoring ventilation of patients via mathematical simulation and machine learning. However, ventilator settings were not varied. In this study we investigated whether an alarm system could be created with which a satisfactory classification performance could be obtained under a wide variety of ventilator settings, by varying inspiratory to expiratory time (I:E) ratio, tidal volume and respiratory rate. In a first experiment three patient data sets were modeled, each with a different I:E ratio. A part of each data set was used to construct an alarm system for each I:E ratio. The remaining part was used to test the performance of the alarm systems. The three training sets were also combined to construct one alarm system, which was tested with the three test sets. Finally, all alarm systems were tested with data generated by a patient simulator. Similar experiments were performed for the tidal volume and the respiratory rate. It was concluded that an optimally functioning alarm system should contain a library of rule sets, one for each set of ventilator settings. A second best alternative is to take all possible settings into consideration when constructing the training set. Classification performance of the trees that were trained with multiple ventilator settings ranged from 98 to 100% for all test sets. When tested with the independent patient simulator data the classification performance of these trees ranged from 80 to 100%.

J	Mulholland, M; Preston, P; Hibbert, DB; Haddad, PR; Compton, P				Mulholland, M; Preston, P; Hibbert, DB; Haddad, PR; Compton, P			Teaching a computer ion chromatography from a database of published methods	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Ion Chromatography Symposium	OCT 01-05, 1995	DALLAS, TX			induction by machine learning; expert systems; optimization; ion chromatography optimization; machine learning; anions; cations	MASS-SPECTRA; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; EXPERT SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; CHEMISTRY	As ion chromatography (IC) has matured as an analytical technique it has become more automated, Most instrument control and data handling is now handled by computers. However, IC has not seen the abundance of automated method optimisation techniques which are provided to conventional chromatography. To a certain extent this was because IC differed greatly in the approach required to optimise selectivity and sensitivity. There was quite a diverse range of chemistries (or separation mechanisms) applicable to IC, such as ion exchange, ion interaction, etc. This paper describes an effort to fill this gap by developing an expert system which can give comprehensive advise on suitable method conditions for a variety of IC mechanisms. To build this system we applied an approach known as induction by machine learning, which was developed within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). A database of over 4000 published methods using IC, where the sample information and the chromatographic conditions were recorded, was used to train an expert system (ES). Both induction and a neural network model were applied to this task and an expert system which can advise on the following IC method conditions: mobile phase, column, pH, mechanism, post-column reactors, suppressor use and gradient applicability, was successfully developed, This paper presents a summary of the most pertinent conclusions from this study. A test set of different methods was extracted from the database and they were not applied in the training of the expert system. These were used to test the expert system and different amounts of information were used as inputs. The resulting outputs of the expert system were evaluated by the expert, who decided whether the method would work or not and if it was a good method or the ideal method for the application. Over 85% of methods were found to work and almost 62% of the methods were considered ideal. These were acceptable results when one considers the limitations of using a database of published methods as a learning set and the time saved by the use of machine learning.

In order to avoid dangerous simplification of the tree by discarding partial knowledge of the experts, a measure of uncertainty with maximizing entropy is applied to fuzzy ID3. (2) Basically the tree based learning is nonincremental or single step. An algebraic method to facilitate incremental learning like the neural nets is adapted and the fuzzy decision tree which consists of B-spline membership function is regarded as three layered neural network. (3) Prototypes of expert system for estimation of wheel wear characteristics and surface roughness in abrasive cut-off are developed.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; ALGORITHMS	Determining the most appropriate Machine Learning (ML) method, system, or algorithm for a particular application is not trivial. This article reports on a survey of 103 experts specializing in ML who were asked to rate ML method appropriateness to intelligent tasks. Ratings were captured via a structured questionnaire including 12 ML methods and 9 task categories. Results showed that the experts mapped particular ML methods to task categories. Factor analysis revealed three fundamental factors, which explained most of the variance in the expert ratings. Machine learning methods could be grouped on the basis of these factors into six application categories, wherein one or more methods were deemed most appropriate by the evaluated group of experts. This, in turn, concludes that cooperation between alternative ML methods may be necessary to support one or more intelligent tasks.

J	Tecuci, G; Hieb, MR				Tecuci, G; Hieb, MR			Teaching intelligent agents: The disciple approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE	The ability to build intelligent agents is significantly constrained by the knowledge acquisition effort required. Many iterations by human experts and knowledge engineers are currently necessary to develop knowledge-based agents with acceptable performance. We have developed a novel approach, called Disciple, for building intelligent agents that relies on an interactive tutoring paradigm, rather than the traditional knowledge engineering paradigm. In the Disciple approach, an expert teaches an agent through five basic types of interactions. Such rich interaction is rare among machine learning (ML) systems, but is necessary to develop more powerful systems. These interactions, from the point of view of the expert, include specifying knowledge to the agent, giving the agent a concrete problem and its solution that the agent is to learn a general rule for, validating analogical problems and solutions proposed by the agent, explaining to the agent reasons for the validation, and being guided to provide new knowledge during interaction. In this article, we illustrate these basic learning interactions between an expert and an intelligent agent in the context of teaching the agent for military training simulations.

These knowledge-based systems are characterized by a cooperative problem-solving procedure. User and system cooperate intensively to produce the aimed result. Machine learning methods can provide significant support for assistant systems. In this article, it is pointed out how assistant systems can be supported in various ways. For instance, machine learning methods can extend, revise, optimize, and adapt the knowledge base of an assistant system. In this way, they can contribute to the utility and maintainability of an intelligent assistant system. They can also increase the flexibility and effectiveness of human-computer interaction. The learning apprentice system COSIMA is presented which acquires knowledge about single problem-solving steps from observation of the user. Production rules for floorplanning, a sub-task of VLSI design, are acquired and refined cooperatively by different learning strategies.

J	Sakakibara, Y; Misue, K; Koshiba, T				Sakakibara, Y; Misue, K; Koshiba, T			A machine learning approach to knowledge acquisitions from text databases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article								The rapid growth of data in large databases, such as text databases and scientific databases, requires efficient computer methods for automating analyses of the data with the goal of acquiring knowledges or making discoveries. Because the analyses of data are generally so expensive, most parts in databases remains as raw, unanalyzed primary data. Technology from machine learning (ML) will offer efficient tools for the intelligent analyses of the data using generalization ability. Generalization is an important ability specific to inductive learning that will predict unseen data with high accuracy based on learned concepts from training examples. In this article, we apply ML to text-database analyses and knowledge acquisitions from text databases. We propose a completely new approach to the problem of text classification and extracting keywords by using ML techniques. We introduce a class of representations for classifying text data based on decision trees; (i.e., decision trees over attributes on strings) and present an algorithm for learning them inductively. Our algorithm has the following features: It does not need any natural language processing technique and it is robust for noisy data. We show that our learning algorithm can be used for automatic extraction of keywords for text retrieval and automatic text categorization. We also demonstrate some experimental results using our algorithm on the problem of classifying bibliographic data and extracting keywords in order to show the effectiveness of our approach.

Our results are compared with those obtained by a neural network classifier created by Storrie-Lombardi et al., and we show that the two methodologies are comparable. We conclude with a demonstration that the original data can be easily classified into less well-defined categories.

In this paper an overview of current research applying the genetic algorithm to fuzzy rule based control is presented. A novel approach to genetics-based machine learning of fuzzy controllers, called a Pittsburgh Fuzzy Classifier System #1 (P-FCS1) is proposed. P-FCS1 is based on the Pittsburgh model of learning classifier systems and employs variable length rule-sets and simultaneously evolves fuzzy set membership functions and relations. A new crossover operator which respects the functional linkage between fuzzy rules with overlapping input fuzzy set membership functions is introduced. Experimental results using P-FCS1 are reported and compared with other published results. Application of P-FCS1 to a distributed control problem (dynamic routing in computer networks) is also described and experimental results are presented.

J	Ishii, M; Akiba, Y; Kaneda, S; Almuallim, H				Ishii, M; Akiba, Y; Kaneda, S; Almuallim, H			Simplification of majority-voting classifiers using binary decision diagrams	SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS IN JAPAN			English	Article						machine learning; knowledge acquisition; ID3		Various versions of the majority-voting classification method have been proposed in recent years as a strategy for improving classification performance. This method generates multiple decision trees from training examples and performs majority voting of classification results from these decision trees in order to classify test examples. In this method, however, since the target concept is represented in multiple decision trees, its readability is poor. This property makes it ineffective in knowledge-base construction. To enable the majority-voting classification method to be applied to knowledge-base construction, this paper proposes a simplification method that converts the entire majority-voting classifier into compact disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas. A significant feature of this method is the use of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) as internal expressions in the conversion process to achieve high-speed simplification. A problem that must be addressed here is the BDD input variable ordering scheme. This paper proposes an ordering scheme based on the order of variables in the decision trees. The simplification method has been applied to several real-world data sets of the Irvine Database and to data from medical diagnosis domain. It was found that the description size of the majority-voting classifier after simplification was on the average from 1.2 to 2.7 times that of a single decision tree and was less than one-third the size of a majority-voting classifier before simplification. Therefore, the method is effective in reducing the description size and should be applicable to the knowledge acquisition process. Using the input variable ordering scheme proposed here, high-speed simplification of several seconds to several tens of seconds is achieved on a Sun SPARC-server 10 workstation.

J	Jochem, T; Pomerleau, D				Jochem, T; Pomerleau, D			Life in the fast lane - The evolution of an adaptive vehicle control system	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article								Giving robots the ability to operate in the real world has been, and continues to be, one of the most difficult tasks in Al research. Since 1987, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have been investigating one such task. Their research has been focused on using adaptive, vision-based systems to increase the driving performance of the Navlab line of on-road mobile robots. This research has led to the development of a neural network system that can learn to drive on many road types simply by watching a human teacher. This article describes the evolution of this system from a research project in machine learning to a robust driving system capable of executing tactical driving maneuvers such as lane changing and intersection navigation.

J	Webb, GI				Webb, GI			Integrating machine learning with knowledge acquisition through direct interaction with domain experts	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge acquisition; machine learning; apprenticeship learning		Knowledge elicitation from experts and empirical machine learning are two distinct approaches to knowledge acquisition with differing and mutually complementary capabilities. Learning apprentices have provided environments in which a knowledge engineer may collaborate with a machine learning system allowing for a synergy between the complementary approaches. The Knowledge Factory is a knowledge acquisition environment that allows a domain expert to collaborate directly with a machine learning system without the need for assistance from a knowledge engineer. This requires a different form of environment to the learning apprentice. The paper describes techniques for supporting such interactions and their implementation in a knowledge acquisition environment called The Knowledge Factory.

The method has been developed within the context of the rough sets model and is based on the concepts of a decision matrix and a decision function. The problem of finding ail the rules is reduced to the problem of computing prime implicants of a group of associated Boolean expressions. The method is particularly applicable to identifying all potentially interesting deterministic rules in a knowledge discovery system but can also be used to produce possible rules or nondeterministic rules with decision probabilities, by adapting the method to the definitions of the variable precision rough sets model.

J	Wang, SH				Wang, SH			Learning monotonic-concave interval concepts using the back-propagation neural networks	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						neural networks; monotonicity; concavity; machine learning		Monotonicity and concavity play important roles in human cognition, reasoning, and decision making. This paper shows that neural networks can learn monotonic-concave interval concepts based on real-world data. Traditionally, the training of neural networks has been based only on raw data. in cases where the training samples carry statistical fluctuations, the products-of the training have often suffered. This paper suggests that global knowledge about monotonicity and concavity of a problem domain can be incorporated in neural network training. This paper proposes a learning scheme for the hack-propagation layered neural networks in learning monotonic-concave interval concepts and provides an example to show its application.

The goal of this paper is thus to disclose theoretical underlying principles of covering learning algorithms. By exploiting the set theory, the paper exhibits how the correctness and generality required for decision rules induced by a covering algorithm may be satisfied. The principle differences between a genuine theoretical approach and actual empirical machine learning algorithms are also discussed.

J	Tag, PM; Peak, JE				Tag, PM; Peak, JE			Machine learning of maritime fog forecast rules	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY			English	Article								In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has contributed significantly to the science of meteorology, most notably in the now familiar form of expert systems. Expert systems have focused on rules or heuristics by establishing, in computer code, the reasoning process of a weather forecaster predicting, for example, thunderstorms or fog. In addition to the years of effort that goes into developing such a knowledge base is the time-consuming task of extracting such knowledge and experience from experts. In this paper, the induction of rules directly from meteorological data is explored-a process called machine learning. A commercial machine learning program, called C4.5, is applied to a meteorological problem, forecasting maritime fog, for which a reliable expert system has been previously developed. Two datasets are used: 1) weather ship observations originally used for testing and evaluating the expert system, and 2) buoy measurements taken off the coast of California. For both datasets, the rules produced by C4.5 are reasonable and make physical sense, thus demonstrating that an objective induction approach can reveal physical processes directly from data. For the ship database, the machine-generated rules are nor as accurate as those from the expert system but are still significantly better than persistence forecasts. For the buoy data, the forecast accuracies are very high, but only slightly superior to persistence. The results indicate that the machine learning approach is a viable tool for developing meteorological expertise, but only when applied to reliable data with sufficient cases of known outcome. Tn those instances when such databases are available, the use of machine learning can provide useful insight that otherwise might take considerable human analysis to produce.

J	Duffy, AHB; Persidis, A; MacCallum, KJ				Duffy, AHB; Persidis, A; MacCallum, KJ			NODES: A numerical and object based modelling system for conceptual engineering design	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						design reuse; synthesis; numerical and object modelling; machine learning		In the early stages of engineering design a considerable amount of experience and knowledge of past designs is used to build and evaluate new empirical models with known design relationships. However, conventional computer-based systems which aim to assist this stage have tended to concentrate on the analytical aspects of the process and have not been successful in accessing this expertise and benefiting from it during synthesis. The paper presents some of the results of a programme of research into methods of representing the knowledge to support modelling during these early stages of the design process. Key features of the modelling at this stage are the use of abstract representations, reuse of past design information, partitioning of designs, and synthesis of concept structures. The work is based on an experimental system, NODES, which was developed to model knowledge of design objects and their associated numerical relations. The utility of the system in creating, evolving and evaluating design solutions is illustrated through a worked example in a typical engineering design application.

These can conspire to cause real-world failures even though the planner is sound and, therefore, ''proves'' that a sequence of actions achieves the goal. Permissive planning, a machine learning extension to classical planning, is one response to this difficulty. This paper describes the permissive planning approach and presents GRASPER, a permissive planning robotic system that learns to robustly pick up novel objects.

Control theory helps when linear controllers have to be developed, but it doesn't sufficiently support the generation of non-linear controllers, although in many cases (such as incompliance control), nonlinear control is essential for achieving high performance. This paper discusses how Machine Learning has been applied to the design of (non-)linear controllers. Several alternative function approximators, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs), and Fuzzy Controllers are analyzed and compared, leading to the definition of two major families: Open Field Function Approximators and Locally Receptive Field Function Approximators. It is shown that RBFNs and Fuzzy Controllers bear strong similarities, and that both have a symbolic interpretation. This characteristic allows for applying both symbolic and statistic learning algorithms to synthesize the network layout from a set of examples and, possibly, some background knowledge. Three integrated learning algorithms, two of which are original, are described and evaluated on experimental test cases. The first test case is provided by a robot KUKA IR-361 engaged into the ''peg-into-hole'' task, whereas the second is represented by a classical prediction task on the Mackey-Glass time series. From the experimental comparison, it appears that both Fuzzy Controllers and RBFNs synthesised from examples are excellent approximators, and that, in practice, they can be even more accurate than MLPs.

J	Klingspor, V; Morik, KJ; Rieger, AD				Klingspor, V; Morik, KJ; Rieger, AD			Learning concepts from sensor data of a mobile robot	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						inductive logic programming; robot navigation; combining sensing and action; perceptually anchored concepts		Machine learning can be a most valuable tool for improving the flexibility and efficiency of robot applications. Many approaches to applying machine learning to robotics are known. Some approaches enhance the robot's high-level processing, the planning capabilities, Other approaches enhance the low-level processing, the control of basic actions. In contrast, the approach presented in this paper uses machine learning for enhancing the link between the low-level representations of sensing and action and the high-level representation of planning. The aim is to facilitate the communication between the robot and the human user. A hierarchy of concepts is learned from route records of a mobile robot. Perception and action are combined at every level, i.e., the concepts are perceptually anchored. The relational learning algorithm GRDT has been developed which completely searches in a hypothesis space, that is restricted by rule schemata, which the user defines in terms of grammars.

J	Chang, KC; Hong, TP; Tseng, SS				Chang, KC; Hong, TP; Tseng, SS			Machine learning by imitating human learning	MINDS AND MACHINES			English	Article						machine learning; human learning; rule; training instance; specialize; generalize		Learning general concepts in imperfect environments is difficult since training instances often include noisy data, inconclusive data, incomplete data, unknown attributes, unknown attribute values and other barriers to effective learning. It is well known that people can learn effectively in imperfect environments, and can manage to process very large amounts of data. Imitating human learning behavior therefore provides a useful model for machine learning in real-world applications. This paper proposes a new, more effective way to represent imperfect training instances and rules, and based on the new representation, a Human-Like Learning (HULL) algorithm for incrementally learning concepts well in imperfect training environments. Several examples are given to make the algorithm clearer. Finally, experimental results are presented that show the proposed learning algorithm works well in imperfect learning environments.

We classify these hyperplanes by parallelism to coordinate axes, by symmetry of the d-cube vertices they avoid, as well as by so-called hull-honesty. (Hull-honest hyperplanes are those whose intersection figure with the d-cube coincides with the convex hull of the d-cube vertices they contain; they do not cut d-cube edges properly.) We describe relationships between these classes and give the exact number of hull-honest hyperplanes in general dimensions. An experimental enumeration of all spanned hyperplanes up to dimension eight showed us the intrinsic difficulty of developing a general enumeration scheme. Motivation for considering such hyperplanes stems from coding theory, from linear programming, and from the theory of machine learning.

J	Dysart, PS				Dysart, PS			Bathymetric surface modeling: A machine learning approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							SEAFLOOR	The objective of this work is to develop a surface modeling system capable of characterizing large gridded bathymetric databases with potential applications to problems such as the extrapolation of survey data to higher resolution, the interpolation of bottom characteristics between surveyed regions, and the correlation of bottom features with other geophysical measurements. The system employs a two-dimensional stochastic seafloor model to represent blocks of gridded bathymetry by a small number of model parameters that describe the physical features of the ocean bottom. This study focuses on the inversion component which is designed to estimate the model parameters quickly without iteration or starting values. Quality high-speed inversions are obtained using machine learning techniques, overcoming many practical limitaions imposed by conventional least squares techniques. This approach leads to the approximation of a direct mapping between the moments of the Fourier transformed data and the model parameter variables. Mapping is accomplished by the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer networks. Validation tests performed on synthetic examples spanning the entire model parameter space yield parameter estimation errors less than 5%. The modeling system is applied to a large northeast Pacific data set to examine correlations between bottom characteristics and sediment thickness. Errors in model parameters estimated from the bathymetric data by Monte Carlo simulation are generally less than 10% dependent on data quality and conformance to model assumptions. The major advantages offered by this approach are clearly demonstrated by its error tolerance and the speed of inverson processing.

J	Murdoch, T; Ball, N				Murdoch, T; Ball, N			Machine learning in configuration design	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						configuration optimization; Kohonen feature map		New methods of configuration analysis have recently emerged that are based on development trends characteristic of many technical systems. It has been found that though the development of any system aims to increase a combination of the performance, reliability and economy, actual design changes are frequently kept to a minimum to reduce the risk of failure. However, a strategy of risk reduction commits the designer to an existing configuration and an approved set of components and materials. Therefore, it is important to analyze the configurations, components, and materials of past designs so that good aspects may be reused and poor ones changed. A good configuration produces the required performance and reliability with maximum economy. These three evaluation criteria form the core of a configuration optimization tool called KATE, where known configurations are optimized producing a set of ranked trial solutions. The authors suggest that this solution set contains valuable design knowledge that can be reused. This paper briefly introduces a generic method of configuration evaluation and then describes the use of a self-organizing neural network, the Kohonen Feature Map, to analyze solution sets by performing an initial data reduction step, producing archetype solutions, and supporting qualitative clustering.

J	Britt, BD; Glagowski, T				Britt, BD; Glagowski, T			Reconstructive derivational analogy: A machine learning approach to automating redesign	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Derivational Analogy; design reuse; design history; knowledge-based circuit design	DESIGN; MOLGEN	This paper describes current research toward automating the redesign process. In redesign, a working design is altered to meet new problem specifications. This process is complicated by interactions between different parts of the design, and many researchers have addressed these issues. An overview is given of a large design tool under development, the Circuit Designer's Apprentice. This tool integrates various techniques for reengineering existing circuits so that they meet new circuit requirements. The primary focus of the paper is one particular technique being used to reengineer circuits when they cannot be transformed to meet the new problem requirements. In these cases, a design plan is automatically generated for the circuit, and then replayed to solve all or part of the new problem. This technique is based upon the derivational analogy approach to design reuse. Derivational Analogy is a machine learning algorithm in which a design plan is saved at the time of design so that it can be replayed on a new design problem. Because design plans were not saved for the circuits available to the Circuit Designer's Apprentice, an algorithm was developed that automatically reconstructs a design plan for any circuit. This algorithm, Reconstructive Derivational Analogy, is described in detail, including a quantitative analysis of the implementation of this algorithm.

The analysis is based on the characteristics of component systems and combining techniques. Important characteristics include the accuracy of component systems, the degree to which component systems complement each other's weaknesses, and the ability of the combining mechanism to make good choices among competing component systems. Empirical measurements in a real-life application, in the Sendzimir rolling mill, have shown that integrating both approaches enables significant improvements. Improvements when combining systems in two oncological domains were smaller, yet positive again. Analytical average-case integrated models consisting of two systems are introduced. Conditions for improvements over the best, average and the worst system are established and the expected gains are analytically computed based on expected performances. Models strongly suggest that a reasonable integration of two systems offers significant improvements over the best single system in many or even most real-life domains.

A machine learning system is presented that uses a simulation model of the target manufacturing system to discover opportunistic control rules. Learning is unsupervised and is driven by a genetic algorithm. The learning method requires very little a priori control knowledge. For this presentation, the decision-making agents are the part types being processed. Part types evolve cooperative strategies for selecting the best route through the manufacturing system based on simulated real-time information that describes the state of the system. Results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.		Bowden, R (reprint author), MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIV,DEPT IND ENGN,CAMPUS MAIL STOP 9542,MISSISSIPPI STATE,MS 39762, USA.

With a mathematical model airway pressure, expiratory gas flow and CO2 concentration at the endotracheal tube are simulated for patients, undergoing volume-controlled ventilation with constant ventilator settings, during normal functioning of the breathing circuit and during breathing circuit mishaps (leaks and obstructions). Simulations were performed for 94 physiologically different 'patients', by varying airway resistance and lung/thorax compliance values in the model. Each simulated breath was described by a set of derived signal features and a label that constituted during which event (normal function or mishap) the breath was recorded. With an inductive machine learning algorithm rules, linking signal feature values to breathing circuit events, were created from data of 54 of the simulated patients. The resulting set of rules was able to classify 99% of events in the data of the remaining 40 patients correctly. Of signals, measured at a ventilated lung simulator, 100% of events were classified correctly.

J	Reich, Y; Medina, MA; Shieh, TY; Jacobs, TL				Reich, Y; Medina, MA; Shieh, TY; Jacobs, TL			Modeling and debugging engineering decision procedures with machine learning	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION	This paper reports on the use of machine learning programs for modeling existing engineering decision procedures. In this acitivity, different models of a decision procedure are constructed by using different machine learning programs as well as by varying their operational parameters and input. These models serve to focus on different aspects of the decision procedure thus improving its understandability, which, in turn, can assist in its evaluation and subsequent debugging. This important modeling role of machine learning programs is exemplified by modeling an existing decision procedure that is used by engineers when they need guidance in selecting among available techniques for modeling ground-water flow in a process of environmental decision making. This decision procedure was corrected and improved in the course of this work. The example demonstrates the practical utility of the modeling role of machine learning for engineering applications.

J	Provost, FJ; Aronis, JM				Provost, FJ; Aronis, JM			Scaling up inductive learning with massive parallelism	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						inductive learning; parallelism; small disjuncts	HEURISTIC-SEARCH	Machine learning programs need to scale up to very large data sets for several reasons, including increasing accuracy and discovering infrequent special cases. Current inductive learners perform well with hundreds or thousands of training examples, but in some cases, up to a million or more examples may be necessary to learn important special cases with confidence. These tasks are infeasible for current learning programs running on sequential machines. We discuss the need for very large data sets and prior efforts to scale up machine learning methods. This discussion motivates a strategy that exploits the inherent parallelism present in many learning algorithms. We describe a parallel implementation of one inductive learning program on the CM-2 Connection Machine, show that it scales up to millions of examples, and show that it uncovers special-case rules that sequential learning programs, running on smaller datasets, would miss. The parallel version of the learning program is preferable to the sequential version for example sets larger than about 10K examples. When learning from a public-health database consisting of 3.5 million examples, the parallel rule-learning system uncovered a surprising relationship that has led to considerable follow-up research.

J	Taber, CS; Timpone, RJ				Taber, CS; Timpone, RJ			Beyond simplicity: Focused realism and computational modeling in international relations	MERSHON INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW			English	Review							CONFLICT; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS	International relations faces an important choice: whether to employ formal or empirical methods that simplify our analysis or to rely on descriptive realism at the expense of focus. Facing this dilemma, many scholars have opted for focused simplicity, When this leads to oversimplification, however, particularly when it leads us to ignore underlying processes and concentrate exclusively on predicting outcomes, the cost is great. Computational modeling enjoys many of the advantages of other formal approaches, while relaxing some of the technical restrictions. Thus, it allows focused realism-the representation of complex structures and processes without losing all-important analytic focus. This essay describes and illustrates the computational approach, reviews the existing international relations applications divided into three categories (dynamic simulations, knowledge-based models, and machine learning), and evaluates the capacity of computational models to achieve focused realism.

J	Linkens, DA; Nyongesa, HO				Linkens, DA; Nyongesa, HO			A hierarchical multivariable fuzzy controller for learning with genetic algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article								The most common approach to multivariate fuzzy control is to extend the single-variable case by combining more state-variable pairs. This approach, however, results in high-dimensional rule-bases that may not be implementable in practical systems. Typically, for each additional state variable, the number of rules increases exponentially. Clearly, the number of rules, even for systems of moderate complexity, becomes impractical in real-time, due to the required processing time. This paper proposes and implements a simplified structure for a multi-variable fuzzy controller, which also reduces the total number of rules. This approach is suitable for machine-learning applications since different rules can be derived to infer the correct control actions, dependent on the controller structure and the way in which the input variables have been paired. The number of rules using this approach is minimal and is a linear function of the number of the state inputs. Furthermore, no fuzzification/defuzzification scaling factors are required for the controllers in intermediate levels of composition. The methodology is demonstrated on an anaesthesia simulation case study.

New approaches for these predictions such as neural network methods, genetic algorithms, machine learning, and graph theoretical methods are discussed. Secondary structure prediction algorithms were improved mostly by considering families of related proteins; however, for the reliable tertiary structure modeling of proteins, knowledge-based techniques are still preferred. Methods and examples with more or less successful results are described. Also, programs and parameterizations for energy minimisations, molecular dynamics, and electrostatic interactions have been improved, especially with respect to their former limits of applicability. Other topics discussed in this review include the use of traditional and on-line databases, the docking problem and surface properties of biomolecules, packing of protein cores, de novo design and protein engineering, prediction of membrane protein structures, the verification and reliability of model structures, and progress made with currently available software and computer hardware. In summary, the prediction of the structure, function, and other properties of a protein is still possible only within limits, but these limits continue to be moved.

Decision tree indiction, based on ID3, is a well-known approach of learning from examples. In this article we introduce a new data representation formalism that extends the original ID3 algorithm. We propose a new algorithm, ID+, which adopts this representation scheme. ID+ provides the capability of modeling dependencies between attributes or attribute values and of handling multiple values per attribute. We demonstrate our work via a series of medical knowledge acquisition experiments that are based on a ''real-world'' application of acute abdominal pain in children. In the context of these experiments we compare ID+ with C4.5, Newld and a Naive Bayesian classifier Results demonstrate that the rules acquired via ID+ improve decision tree clinical comprehensibility and complement explanations supported by the Naive Bayesian classifier, while in terms of classification, accuracy decrease is marginal.

J	Clearwater, SH; Hogg, T				Clearwater, SH; Hogg, T			Problem structure heuristics and scaling behavior for genetic algorithms	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						search phase transitions; constraint satisfaction; genetic algorithms; problem structure search heuristic	CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION	Recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that simple parameters characterizing the structure of many constraint satisfaction problems also predict the cost to solve them, on average. We apply these observations as a heuristic to improve the performance of genetic algorithms for some constraint satisfaction problems. In particular, we use a simple cost measure to evaluate the likely solution difficulty of the different unsolved subproblems appearing in the population. This is used to determine which individuals contribute to subsequent generations and improves upon the traditional direct use of the underlying cost function. As a specific test case, we used the GENESIS genetic algorithm to search for the optimum of a class of random Walsh polynomials and identified the improvement due to this new heuristic. We describe how this improvement depends on the population size and accuracy of the underlying theory. Finally, we discuss extensions to other types of machine learning and problem solving systems.

We approach decision making using concept formation techniques, namely the prototype model, and identify decision making preference via a two-phase process. During the first phase we identify crisp decision patterns while in the second we focus on patterns that are influenced by decision-making context. Descriptions that associate bath types of decision patterns are induced using machine learning. We demonstrate our model using a medical domain that relates to therapeutic planning of maldescensus testis in children. Finally we explore advantages and limitations of our method and discuss the potential for further research on the subject.

J	Zhao, Y; Atkeson, CG				Zhao, Y; Atkeson, CG			Implementing projection pursuit learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article							DIMENSION REDUCTION; REGRESSION; NETWORKS	This paper examines the implementation of projection pursuit regression (PPR) in the context of machine learning and neural networks. We propose a parametric PPR with direct training which achieves improved training speed and accuracy when compared with nonparametric PPR. Analysis and simulations are done for heuristics to choose good initial projection directions. A comparison of a projection pursuit learning network with a one hidden-layer sigmoidal neural network shows why grouping hidden units in a projection pursuit learning network is useful. Learning robot arm inverse dynamics is used as an example problem.

J	Pattichis, CS; Schizas, CN				Pattichis, CS; Schizas, CN			Genetics-based machine learning for the assessment of certain neuromuscular disorders	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article								Clinical electromyography (EMG) provides useful information for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. The utility of artificial neural networks (ANN's) in classifying EMG data trained with backpropagation or Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps algorithm has recently been demonstrated. The objective of this study is to investigate how genetics-based machine learning (GBML) can be applied for diagnosing certain neuromuscular disorders based on EMG data. The effect of GBML control parameters on diagnostic performance is also examined. A hybrid diagnostic system Is introduced that combines both neural network and GBML models. Such a hybrid system provides the end-user with a robust and reliable system, as its diagnostic performance relies on more than one learning principle. In the clinical EMG laboratory, 680 motor unit action potentials (MUAP's) were collected from 12 normal, 11 motor neuron disease, and 11 myopathy subjects. Eight subjects from each group formed the training set, and the other 10 subjects formed the evaluation set. Each subject was described by a 14-element feature vector consisting of the mean and the standard deviation of each of the following MUAP parameters: duration, spike duration, amplitude, area, spike area, phases, and turns. More than a thousand GBML models were developed by varying the following parameters: message length size (49, 74), number of classifiers (100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500), lifetax (0.000, 0.002, 0.005, 0.010), period of genetic algorithm (GA) introduced, which is expressed in iterations, showing how often the classifier system calls the GA (50, 100, 200, 500), crossover probability (0.5, 1.0), and mutation probability (0.00, 0.01, 0.02). A total of 28 models were selected that achieved a diagnostic yield better than 95% and 70% for the training and evaluation sets, respectively. This criterion, suggested by two expert neurophysiologists, has formed the bases for classifying a GBML model as ''successful'' and worthy of further consideration in a clinical environment. The performance of GBML models as affected by varying the above parameters can be summarized as follows: 1) 49-bit MUAP parameters decoding scheme were sufficient for accommodating the complexity of the feature vector; 2) the number of classifiers for selected models trained with 74-bit data strings were 300 and 500, whereas the number of classifiers for most selected models with 49-bit data strings were 200 and 500; 3) by increasing lifetax, training performance is reduced, whereas evaluation performance remains at the same levels; 4) the genetic algorithm should not be called upon very frequently because it causes drastic changes to the status of the classifiers; and 5) models with crossover probability equal to one yielded better overall performance. GBML models demonstrated similar performance to neural-network models, but with less computation. The diagnostic performance of neural network and GBML models is enhanced by the hybrid system.

In particular we illustrate in detail the process by which an initial model of Propose Pr Revise problem solving was constructed using a generative grammar of model fragments and then refined and operationalized in the VITAL operational conceptual modelling language (OCML). In the paper we also discuss in detail the properties of a particular Propose & Revise architecture, called ''Complete-Model-then-Revise'', and we show that it compares favourably in terms of competence with alternative Propose & Revise models. Moreover, using as an example the VT domain ontology provided as part of the Sisyphus II task, we critically examine the issues affecting the development of reusable ontologies. Finally, we discuss the performance of our problem solver and we show how we can use machine learning techniques to uncover additional strategic knowledge not present in the VT domain.

Based on random set theory, we develop some estimation theorems and procedures for set-valued statistics, such as nonparametric estimators and set-valuedization techniques. Under random interval assumption, we establish some special possibility distributions that can be easily implemented in knowledge acquisition tools. The knowledge studied here are rules describing relationships between various concepts, as used in diagnosis (pattern recognition) expert systems. Several examples are given to illustrate the estimation theorems and procedures for the acquisition of concepts and relationships. We use our acquisition techniques on a modeling prediction example in two different ways: One is by acquiring the concepts and relationships simultaneously; another is by acquiring rules for predefined concepts. On two classification problems, we use our methods to acquire classification rules. The results are compared with several machine learning methods. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	Chen, HC; Schuffels, C; Orwig, R				Chen, HC; Schuffels, C; Orwig, R			Internet categorization and search: A self-organizing approach	JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION			English	Article							DOCUMENT-RETRIEVAL; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; ALGORITHMS; HYPERTEXT; SYSTEM	The problems of information overload and vocabulary differences have become more pressing with the emergence of increasingly popular Internet services. The main information retrieval mechanisms provided by the prevailing Internet WWW software are based on either keyword search (e.g., the Lycos server at CNU, the Yahoo server at Stanford) or hypertext browsing (e.g., Mosaic and Netscape). This research aims to provide an alternative concept-based categorization and search capability for WWW servers based on selected machine learning algorithms. Our proposed approach, which is grounded on automatic textual analysis of Internet documents (homepages), attempts to address the Internet search problem by first categorizing the content of Internet documents. We report results of our recent testing of a multilayered neural network clustering algorithm employing the Kohonen self-organizing feature map to categorize (classify) Internet homepages according to their content. The category hierarchies created could serve to partition the vast Internet services into subject-specific categories and databases and improve Internet keyword searching and/or browsing.

J	Sammut, C				Sammut, C			Automatic construction of reactive control systems using symbolic machine learning	KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW			English	Article								This paper reviews a number of applications of machine learning to industrial control problems. We take the point of view of trying to automatically build rule-based reactive systems for tasks that, if performed by humans, would require a high degree of skill, yet are generally performed without thinking. Such skills are said to be sub-cognitive. While this might seem restrictive, most human skill is executed subconsciously and only becomes conscious when an unfamiliar circumstance is encountered. This kind of skill lends itself well to representation by a reactive system, that is, one that does not create a detailed model of the world, but rather, attempts to match percepts with actions in a very direct manner.

J	Bartfai, G				Bartfai, G			On the match tracking anomaly of the ARTMAP neural network	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						match tracking; ARTMAP; adaptive resonance theory; supervised learning; self-organization; hierarchical clustering; machine learning; zoo database	ARCHITECTURE; PATTERNS	This article analyses the match tracking anomaly (MTA) of the ARTMAP neural network. The anomaly arises when an input pattern exactly matches its category prototype that the network has previously learned, and the network generates a prediction (through a previously learned associative link) that contradicts the output category that was selected upon presentation of the corresponding target output. Carpenter et al. claimed that such an anomalous situation will never arise if the (binary) input vectors have the same number of 1s (Carpenter et al., 1991, Neural Networks, 4, 565-588). This paper shows that such situations can in fact occur. The timing according to which inputs are presented to the network in each learning trial is crucial. if the target output is presented to the network before the corresponding input pattern, certain pattern sequences will lead the network to the MTA. Two kinds of MTA are distinguished: one that is independent of the choice parameter (beta) of the ART(b) module, and another that is nor. Results of experiments that were carried out on a machine learning database demonstrate the existence of the match tracking anomaly as well as support the analytical results presented here.

J	Aslam, JA; Decatur, SE				Aslam, JA; Decatur, SE			On the sample complexity of noise-tolerant learning	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						machine learning; computational learning theory; computational complexity; fault tolerance; theory of computation		In this paper, we further characterize the complexity of noise-tolerant learning in the PAC model, Specifically, we show a general lower bound of Omega(log(1/delta)/epsilon(1 - 2 eta)(2)) on the number of examples required for PAC learning in the presence of classification noise, Combined with a result of Simon, we effectively show that the sample complexity of PAC learning in the presence of classification noise is Omega(VC(F)/epsilon(1-2 eta)(2) + log(1/delta)/epsilon(1 - 2 eta)(2)). Furthermore, we demonstrate the optimality of the general lower bound by providing a noise-tolerant learning algorithm for the class of symmetric Boolean functions which uses a sample size within a constant factor of this bound. Finally, we note that our general lower bound compares favorably with various general upper bounds for PAC learning in the presence of classification noise.

J	Tuma, A; Haasis, HD; Rentz, O				Tuma, A; Haasis, HD; Rentz, O			Development of emission orientated production control strategies using fuzzy expert systems, neural networks and neuro-fuzzy approaches	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						expert systems; multicriteria analysis; production and process control; economics; neural networks; hybrid systems		In industrial production processes, materials and different forms of energy are provided, converted, stored and transported. Environmental impacts can be identified at any stage of the energy and material how process. Due to the fact that production units and processes are interconnected with energy and material flows, it is of special interest to develop production control mechanisms, which control the energy and material streams so that available resources are utilised most efficiently and reduce emissions and by-products caused by the production process. Methodical production control strategies can be based on optimal algorithms, production rules or methods of machine learning. Due to the complexity of real production systems, it is advisable to use heuristic approaches. In order to analyse the behaviour of different control strategies, the developed systems are verified by an exemplary production system from the textile industry, consisting of a dye house, a hydro-power, a boiler house, and a flue gas neutralisation facility. A verification of the developed systems shows that Fuzzy Expert Systems, Neural Networks, and Neuro-Fuzzy approaches can be applied for the controlling of energy and material flows, taking into account economic and emission orientated goals.

Computer-aided diagnosis offers some help; however, existing systems still produce high error rates. We therefore tested machine learning techniques in order to improve standard statistical systems. The investigation was based on a prospective clinical database with 1254 cases, 46 diagnostic parameters and 15 diagnoses. Independence Bayes and the automatic rule induction techniques ID3, NewId, PRISM, CN2, C4.5 and ITRULE were trained with 839 cases and separately tested on 415 cases. No major differences in overall accuracy were observed (43-48%), except for NewId, which was below the average. Between the different techniques some similarities were found, but also considerable differences with respect to specific diagnoses. Machine learning techniques did not improve the results of the standard model Independence Bayes. Problem dimensionality, sample size and model complexity are major factors influencing diagnostic accuracy in computer-aided diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.

J	Morales, EM				Morales, EM			Learning playing strategies in chess	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; first-order induction; ILP chess; KPK; KRK		It is believed that chess masters use pattern-based knowledge to analyze a position, followed by a pattern-based controlled search to verify or correct the analysis. This paper describes a first-order system called PAL that can learn patterns in the form of Horn clauses from simple example descriptions and general purpose knowledge. It is shown how PAL can learn chess patterns that are beyond the learning capabilities of current inductive systems. The patterns learned by PAL can be used for analysis of positions and for the construction of playing strategies. By taking the learned patterns as attributes for describing examples, a set of rules which decide whether a Pawn can safely be promoted without moving the King in a King and Pawn vs King endgame, is automatically constructed with a similarity-based learning algorithm. Similarly, a playing strategy for the King and Rook vs King endgame is automatically constructed with a simple learning algorithm by following traces of games and using the patterns learned by PAL. Limitations of fi rst-order systems, PAL imparticularly, are exposed in domains where a large number of background definitions may be required for induction. Conclusions and future research directions are given.		Morales, EM (reprint author), INST TECNOL & ESTUDIOS SUPER MONTERREY,CAMPUS MORELOS,APTO POSTAL C-99,CUERNAVACA 62050,MORELOS,MEXICO.

J	Levinson, R				Levinson, R			General game-playing and reinforcement learning	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						games; mathematical structure; heuristic search; machine learning; hypergraphs; neural networks; analogical reasoning; RETE; relational patterns; hierarchical reinforcement learning		This paper provides a blueprint for the development of a fully domain-independent single-agent and multiagent heuristic search system. It gives a graph-theoretic representation of search problems based on conceptual graphs and outlines two different learning systems. One, an ''informed learner'', makes use of the graph-theoretic definition of a search problem or game in playing and adapting to a game in the given environment. The other, a ''blind learner'', is not given access to the rules of a domain but must discover and then exploit the underlying mathematical structure of a given domain. Relevant work of others is referenced within the context of the blueprint. To illustrate further how one might go about creating general game-playing agents, we show how we can generalize the understanding obtained with the Morph chess system to all games involving the interactions of abstract mathematical relations. A monitor for such domains has been developed, along with an implementation of a blind and informed learning system known as MorphII. Performance results with MorphII are preliminary but encouraging and provide a few more data points with which to understand and evaluate the blueprint.

J	Epstein, SL; Gelfand, J; Lesniak, J				Epstein, SL; Gelfand, J; Lesniak, J			Pattern-based learning and spatially oriented concept formation in a multi-agent, decision-making expert	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						concept formation; game playing; pattern recognition; machine learning; spatially oriented reasoning; decision making; Hoyle; morris games	MEMORY; CHESS; SEARCH	As they gain expertise in problem solving, people increasingly rely on patterns and spatially oriented reasoning. This paper describes an associative visual-pattern classifier and the automated acquisition of new, spatially oriented reasoning agents that simulate such behavior. They are incorporated into a multi-agent game-learning program whose architecture robustly combines agents with conflicting perspectives. When tested on three games, the visual-pattern classifier learns meaningful patterns, and the pattern-based, spatially oriented agents generalized from these patterns are generally correct. The accuracy of the contribution of each of the newly created agents to the decision-making process is measured against an expert opponent, and a perceptron-like algorithm is used to learn game-specific weights for these agents. Much of the knowledge encapsulated by the new agents was previously inexpressible in the program's representation and in some cases is not readily deducible from the rules.

With this process joint products in different states of aggregation are emitted. Environmental impacts can be identified at any stage of the energy and material flow process. Due to the fact that production units and processes are interconnected with energy and material flows, it is of special interest to develop production control mechanisms which control the energy and material streams in a way that utilizes available resources most efficiently and reduces emissions and by-products caused by the production process. These production control strategies have to consider variations in the input and output flows of succeeding and preceding production units. The development of production control strategies depends especially on the structure of integrated production systems. If it is possible to influence the energy and material flows by the selection of special production processes and an adequate allocation of jobs and aggregates, the construction of production control strategies can be reduced to a combined scheduling and technology selection problem. Methodical production control strategies can be based on optimal algorithms (e.g. dynamic programming) heuristics (e.g, rule-based approaches) and methods of machine learning (e.g. neural networks). Due to the complexity of real production systems, it is advisable to use rule-based approaches or neural networks depending on the structure of the available production knowledge.

J	Lovell, BC; Bradley, AP				Lovell, BC; Bradley, AP			The multiscale classifier	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						multiscale classification; decision trees; inductive machine learning; tree pruning		In this paper we propose a rule-based inductive learning algorithm called Multiscale Classification (MSC). It can be applied to any N-dimensional real or binary classification problem to classify the training data by successively splitting the feature space in half. The algorithm has several significant differences from existing mts-based approaches: learning is incremental, the tree is non-binary, and backtracking of decisions is possible to some extent. The paper first provides background on current machine learning techniques and outlines some of their strengths and weaknesses. It then describes the MSC algorithm and compares it to other inductive learning algorithms with particular reference to ID3, C4.5, and back-propagation neural networks. Its performance on a number of standard benchmark problems is then discussed and related to standard learning issues such as generalization, representational power, and over-specialization.

J	Ravikumar, CP; Aggarwal, R				Ravikumar, CP; Aggarwal, R			Parallel search-and-learn techniques and graph coloring	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						parallel search; heuristic search; combinatorial optimization; graph coloring; machine learning		The paper describes a parallel algorithm for graph coloring. The algorithm is based on a search-and-learn technique for combinatorial optimization, where multiple heuristics are used to search nearly disjoint subspaces of the combinatorial search space, and the resulting solutions are analyzed for good decisions. A decision takes the form 'color nodes i and j using the same color'. If a majority of the heuristics concur on coloring two nodes with the same color, the two nodes are merged into a supernode. Supernodes of more than two nodes can similarly be identified. The given graph can be collapsed into a smaller graph, the node set of which consists of supernodes. It is shown that an optimal coloring of the collapsed graph can be used to construct an optimal coloring of the original graph. Parallelism in the search-and-learn technique is prevalent in the multiple heuristic search phase, and it is easy to exploit using a multiprocessor or a multicomputer environment. In the implementation, a network of Sun workstations is used for parallelization. Experimental results are described for a number of large benchmark examples. The results show that the technique can deliver superlinear speedup and superlinear quality for large and difficult examples of node coloring.

The system is capable of accounting for uncertainty, not only in the prediction of solute transport but also in the optimization of the remediation scheme through chance constraints. The system guides users in the selection of appropriate transport models through an algorithm independently tested with machine learning codes. An application to Hill Air Force Base, Utah, is presented for which different pump-and-treat strategies are considered: the results are evaluated in terms of the cumulative distribution of the contaminant concentration for each case and the tradeoff relationship between the cost of remediation and the probability that the remediation strategy exceeds an established maximum allowable contaminant concentration.

J	King, RD; Muggleton, SH; Srinivasan, A; Sternberg, MJE				King, RD; Muggleton, SH; Srinivasan, A; Sternberg, MJE			Structure-activity relationships derived by machine learning: The use of atoms and their bond connectivities to predict mutagenicity by inductive logic programming	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							DIHYDROFOLATE-REDUCTASE; NITRO-COMPOUNDS; BINDING; SHAPE	We present a general approach to forming structure-activity relationships (SARs). This approach is based on representing chemical structure by atoms and their bond connectivities in combination with the inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithm PROGOL. Existing SAR methods describe chemical structure by using attributes which are general properties of an object, It is not possible to map chemical structure directly to attribute-based descriptions, as such descriptions have no internal organization, A more natural and general way to describe chemical structure is to use a relational description, where the internal construction of the description maps that of the object described. Our atom and bond connectivities representation is a relational description, ILP algorithms can form SARs with relational descriptions, We have tested the relational approach by investigating the SARs of 230 aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds, These compounds had been split previously into two subsets, 188 compounds that were amenable to regression and 42 that were not, For the 188 compounds, a SBR was found that was as accurate as the best statistical or neural network-generated SARs, The PROGOL SAR has the advantages that it did not need the use of any indicator variables handcrafted by an expert, and the generated rules were easily comprehensible. For the 42 compounds, PROGOL formed a SAR that was significantly (P < 0.025) more accurate than linear regression, quadratic regression, and back-propagation. This SAR is based on an automatically generated structural alert for mutagenicity.

Genetic Programming is an emerging technique similar in spirit to Genetic Algorithms which employ a metric to drive a parallel search of the solution space. In contrast to genetic algorithms which yield a single encoded string as the solution, genetic programming yields a computer program which can be examined and understood. Genetic Programming also offers the possibility of enabling a technique whereby feature vectors can be automatically developed. We have applied the technique to the determination of ship aimpoints from segmented imagery using input from a sensor. The raw imagery is then processed and a feature vector extracted, as was done in a previous problem. The feature vectors are then used as input to the genetic programming technique. We will report on the sensitivity of performance of the genetic programming technique as a function of the metric employed. In addition we will compare the performance of the computer program obtained by genetic programming to the performance of a back propagation neural networks developed for our problem. Furthermore we will report on the performance results obtained using Genetic Programming with and without the presence of automatically created subroutines as well as the determination of critical inputs.

Existing techniques for dealing with the first and third cases are exclusively based on probability estimation. However, when there are continuous attributes in the example space, and if these attributes have been discretized into intervals before induction, fuzzy interpretation of the discretized intervals at deduction time could be very valuable. This paper describes the fuzzy matching techniques implemented in the HCV (Version 2.0) software, and presents a hybrid interpretation mechanism which combines fuzzy matching with probability estimation. Experiment results of the HCV (Version 2.0) software with different interpretation techniques are provided on a number of data sets from the University of California at Irvine Repository of Machine Learning Databases.

In this paper we use the notion of similitude terms, a symbolic representation of structural similarity proposed in an earlier paper. We argue that the issue to be addressed is estimating the relevance of similitude terms with regard to the task at hand, and then we propose a way of using the Case Base to estimate the relevance of similitude terms called the discriminating base. Two specific measures based on Shannon entropy are proposed to assess this relevance: I, the importance of a similitude term, and G, the similitude-based class evidence that estimates class aggregate importance. We show an application of I in the system SPIN for marine sponges identification. A longer version of this paper applies G to two standard Machine Learning datasets for classification tasks (1).

This paper reopens the issue of understandability of induced theories, which, while prominent in the early days of M-L, seems to have fallen from favor in the sequel. This issue is especially relevant in the broader context of using ML as an aide in design and maintenance of knowledge bases for knowledge based systems. The guiding question is: beyond accuracy, what constitutes a good theory? An attempt at surveying relevant work in the fields of linguistics and cognitive psychology is made. The sympathetic reader will find this somewhat motivates the author's personal intuitions about the quality of a theory, hinging on understandability. These intuitions, in turn, point toward some simple criteria that may help in measuring quality. By way of consolation for those who do not share the author's intuitions, the criteria proposed here are objective in the sense that the measurements they provide may be evaluated from a number of contrary perspectives. Some empirical results are given in the context of theory restructuring: redundancy elimination and introduction of new intermediate concepts.

The present research evaluates the prospects of discovering such knowledge from industrial databases. Three different databases are considered and three different machine learning tools (conceptual clustering, neural net, and inductive logic programming) are applied in an experimental fashion. From these experiences it could be concluded that the tool box philosophy has severe limitations in highly structured industrial application areas. It was thus suggested that higher order conceptualizations of machine learning should be developed which are easier to apply and understand by the user. A preview of the KOALA system which is currently under development is then presented. By applying constraint satisfaction over hierarchically structured domains, the KOALA system allows the user to have his own machine learning application being configured according to the domain ontologies and the specific needs of a given field of application.

This architecture is based on machine learning and on cognitive psychology studies in concept formation. Our basic assumption is that concept formation should be considered as a goal-driven, context-dependent process and, therefore, that the hierarchical organization of concepts should be represented in different perspectives. The core of our architecture is a learning system that generates multi-perspective hierarchies. The evaluation of the architecture is realized from a perspective of both the comprehensibility and the prediction power of the generated knowledge.

We conclude that it is similar to that of knowledge acquisition, yet unique in that it employs pre-existing data collected for reasons other than analysis. The post-hoc nature of KDD means that the database is often unfit for analysis using traditional machine-learning techniques. We present a methodology for KDD that attempts to overcome this problem. Knowledge elicitation techniques are employed to define the structure of an appropriate learning dataset and to relate this structure to the raw database. The raw database is then redescribed in terms of the new structure before machine learning tools are applied. We also present CASTLE, a software workbench designed to support this methodology, and illustrate it's usage upon a worked example drawn from the Sisyphus-I room allocation problem.

Machine learning technologies such as neural networks are suitable for application in the adaptive control of this cold forming task where the complexity of numerous variable effects is not readily quantifiable. This paper presents the findings of research wherein the effectiveness of this concept using a sensor-equipped shop table bender was investigated. Results indicate that the neural network model performs well in predicting springback for a variety of rebar sizes and bend angles. A human-in-the-loop intelligent system with small modifications in the shop bender promises to be a most effective strategy towards the full automation of bending rebars.

This paper describes an approach to process improvement that is being developed collaboratively by applied researchers at US WEST, a major telecommunications company, and the University of Colorado. Motivated by the need to streamline and to add more quantitative power to traditional quality improvement processes, the new approach uses an artificial intelligence (Al) statistical tree growing method that uses customer survey data to identify operations areas where improvements are expected to affect customers most. This AI/statistical method also identifies realistic quantitative targets for improvement and suggests specific strategies (recommended combinations of actions) that are predicted to have high impact. This research, funded in part by the Colorado Advanced Software Institute (CASI) in an effort to stimulate profitable innovations, has resulted in a practical methodology that has been used successfully at US WEST to help set process improvement priorities and to guide resource allocation decisions throughout the company.

The decision tree generated by the induction algorithm is generally used to create a set of rules for a traditional rule-based system; however, it may be used to determine the weight (i.e., importance) of features for classification. This approach combines the flexibility of CBR systems with the machine-learning ability to automatically derive decision criteria. We experimentally assess the tolerance of rule induction to noise and missing values and fmd it surprisingly resilient to poor-quality training data. This bodes well for use of rule induction to allow the process of CBR system development to be mole independent of expert judgement.

The goal is to improve useability of EMR systems by having the computer anticipate physicians' data entry actions. We investigate generation of short menus (hot lists) that offer likely selections to the user, A task model from which we derive hot lists is formed by machine learning from a database of 3085 records of past encounters, The hot lists anticipate a patient's drug treatment (from among 332 generic names) using already-entered problem codes. Based on simulated data entry using records field back from training, hot lists of length 12 contain just under 70% of drug selections. 86% hit rates are found with anticipation of drug categories. The results show promise for development of useful task models via machine learning for complex domains such as medicine.

Previous research in speech processing and cognitive modelling has tended to concentrate on single sources and relatively noise-free signals. Separating out different signals from a multitude of sources is a significant part of human auditory processing. In speech processing research, the problem we are dealing with is known as the cocktail party syndrome. The processing of polyphonic music involves similar challenges, and auditory scene analysis (ASA) has been proposed as a means of separating out component signals and identifying their sources. In subliminal auditory processing, a speech signal which is masked from conscious awareness by a music signal provides an extreme form of the multiple source problem and permits exploration of the boundary between conscious and unconscious auditory processing. The research presented employs machine learning and associative models to characterize and track individual signals, and uses electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis to more precisely characterize human processing of multimodal signals.

The final set is initially used to control the robot navigating an obstacle-free path planned in a polygonal environment with satisfactory results.

From examples gathered through spying evolution or experimenting on populations, induction extracts a rule-based characterization of which evolutionary events are good or bad for evolution. Such rule base allows for further generations to escape most disruptive or unproductive changes, according to a civilized rather than Darwinian evolution scheme. An evolutionary event is described as mutating a chromosome (at given bit-string positions) or crossing over two chromosomes (with given crossing points), and labeled by comparing the fitness of the offspring with that of its parents. Knowledge induced from such events allows to predict the effects of further operators, thereby filtering further undesirable events. Experimentations on some artificial problems are discussed.

The organization of design knowledge impacts the quality of inference and support a designer may derive from a case based system. Machine learning over case data may be used to create an intelligent interface between designer requirements and available design knowledge. Such an interface assists the designer in navigating the case base for effective case based retrieval. This paper explores two neural architectures based upon the Adaptive Resonance Theory for automated generation of design representations useful during the preliminary stages of case based retrieval. A standard bridge design case base is used to demonstrate the approach.

We make a comparison between the performance of linear discriminant analysis, classification trees and neural networks in predicting corporate bankruptcy Linear discriminant analysis represents the ''classical'' statistical approach to classification, whereas classification frees and neural networks represent artificial intelligence approaches. A proper statistical design is used to be able to test whether observed differences in predictive performance are statistically significant The dataset consists of two large collections of annual reports from Belgian companies. The first collection contains the reports of 994 industrial companies and the second collection contains the reports of 576 construction companies. We use stratified 10-fold cross-validation on the training set to choose ''good'' parameter values for the different learning methods. The test set is used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the true prediction error, For both industrial and construction companies the result of neural networks is better than the results of the other learning techniques. Upon rigorous statistical testing only the difference between the classification free and the neural network for the construction companies is found to be significant.

The machine specifications such as pressure capacity, bending length and so on must be considered in the selection of sheet metal bending tooling in order to reach the optimal choice based on the needs of the decision maker. This paper proposes a model using machine learning from neural networks in an expert system of sheet metal bending tooling. In this system, the pattern classification capability of the back-propagation neural networks is utilized to complete, by means of training and testing of the networks, the knowledge acquisition and knowledge inference in the expert system. In this learning model, the learning methods are divided into two categories according to their problem attributes: digital attributes and conditional attributes. The problem with two digital analytical attributes and the problem with multi-decision conditional attributes both yield ideal learning effects. In this paper, a learning model with conditional attributes is used to develop the expert system of sheet metal bending tooling selection, which belongs to a multiple decision model.

In a first stage, we show that object-oriented query languages are well suited for the production of patterns as well as for the interpretation of the biological function of new (uncharacterized) sequences. In a second stage, a classification is built from the set of sequences according to the pattern matches. This classification may be criticized by a specific analysis method, which yields back to revise sequences and patterns. In our application, we have used concept lattices as a classification method and sequence multiple alignment for criticism.

J	Sandholm, TW; Crites, RH				Sandholm, TW; Crites, RH			Multiagent reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma	BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						multiagent learning; reinforcement learning; machine learning; Prisoner's Dilemma; recurrent neural network; exploration	ELEMENTS	Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the idea that the tendency to produce an action should be strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favorable results, and weakened if it produces unfavorable results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that does not need a model of its environment and can be used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL research has been confined to single-agent settings or to multiagent settings where the agents have totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither totally positively nor totally negatively correlated. RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain. This paper investigates the ability of a variety of Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent is the fixed strategy Tit-For-Tat, while in others it is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to play optimally against Tit-For-Tat. Playing against another learner was more difficult because the adaptation of the other learner created a non-stationary environment, and because the other learner was not endowed with any a priori knowledge about the IPD game such as a policy designed to encourage cooperation. The learners that were studied varied along three dimensions: the length of history they received as context, the type of memory they employed (lookup tab;les based on restricted history windows or recurrent neural networks that can theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in the past), and the exploration schedule they followed. Although all the learners faced difficulties when playing against other learners, agents with longer history windows, lookup table memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best in the IPD games.

Knowledge acquisition by itself is a very time consuming and tedious process. The uncertainty of information and erroneous data have also caused knowledge engineers anxious moments. In order to address these problems, several machine learning techniques supported by well-formulated theories and algorithms, have been developed. In this article some of these techniques are reviewed along with examples of their application to civil engineering problems. The techniques presented either fall under the category ''learning from examples'' (commonly referred to as inductive learning) including the ID3 algorithm, the rough sets theory, and the PROTOS algorithm, or ''learning from observations'' (also known as conceptual clustering) including the COBWEB algorithm, or a combination of both.

J	Cunningham, SJ				Cunningham, SJ			Machine learning applications in anthropology: Automated discovery over kinship structures	COMPUTERS AND THE HUMANITIES			English	Article						machine learning; induction; inductive logic programming; FOIL	RULES	A common problem in anthropological field work is generalizing rules governing social interactions and relations (particularly kinship) from a series of examples. One class of machine learning algorithms is particularly well-suited to this task: inductive logic programming systems, as exemplified by FOIL. A knowledge base of relationships among individuals is established, in the form of a series of single-predicate facts. Given a set of positive and negative examples of a new relationship, the machine learning programs build a Horn clause description of the target relationship. The power of these algorithms to derive complex hypotheses is demonstrated for a set of kinship relationships drawn from the anthropological literature. FOIL extends the capabilities of earlier anthropology-specific learning programs by providing a more powerful representation for induced relationships, and is better able to learn in the face of noisy or incomplete data.

Considering the validity decision problem for a disjunctive normal form (DNF), the following result is obtained by analyzing the problem from the constructive view point: among all DNFs generated by composing a given number of definite proposition variables, a dominant majority come with pair(s) of single literal clauses, the variable itself and its negation. Based on this finding, this paper proposes a much faster algorithm for this problem compared to traditional techniques and provides a thorough analysis on its potential performance. Analysis results show that the algorithm is by far superior to a classical algorithm in most of cases. Simulation results are also provided to confirm our theoretical analysis.

SEEA is an inductive process which attempts to determine the impacts and severity of software failures. The purpose of our work is to exploit historical SEEA, which have already been carried out on approved safety-critical software, in order to assess SEEA of a new software. The production of this mock-up, in the process of validation, involves the use of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). This is one of the reasoning types used in artificial intelligence for machine learning. The basic principle of CBR is to deal with a new problem by remembering similar experiences which have occurred in the past.

In particular, it offers classifiers that combine accuracy and smoothness with deep insight into their decision process. However, their automatic induction from raw numerical databases is an intricate task, so that most existing procedures rely heavily on the user's expertise. In this paper we propose two methods that aim at completely relieving the user from any part of the induction process, without sacrificing the above advantages. The first scheme is based on an extension of the very concept of fuzzy partitioning, whereas the second one involves a new family of discrimination quality measures more suitable for smooth partitioning than traditional ones. Their behavior on an actual case of transient stability assessment is evaluated and compared with conventional decision trees.

Feature selection plays a central role in the data analysis process since redundant and irrelevant features often degrade the performance of induction algorithms, both in speed and predictive accuracy. ADHOC combines the advantages of both filter and feedback approaches to feature selection to enhance the understanding of the given data and increase the efficiency of the feature selection process. We report results of extensive experiments on real-world data which demonstrate the effectiveness of ADHOC as data reduction technique as well as feature selection method. ADHOC has been employed in the analysis of several corporate databases. In particular, it is currently used to support the difficult task of early estimating the cost of software projects.

We describe a system called MLC++, which was designed to help choose the appropriate classification algorithm for a given dataset by making it easy to compare the utility of different algorithms on a specific dataset of interest. MLC++ not only provides a work-bench for such comparisons, but also provides a library of C++ classes to aid in the development of new algorithms, especially hybrid algorithms and multi-strategy algorithms. Such algorithms are generally hard to code from scratch. We discuss design issues, interfaces to other programs, and visualization of the resulting classifiers.

Its evaluation and validation with experimental biodegradation data clearly show that the developed model gives a realistic and reliable account of structure-biodegradability relationship for organic chemicals. The same set of experts judgement data was used to develop structure-biodegradation rule by the application of an inductive machine learning method. An improved structure-biodegradation rule was derived from a larger training see of 160 chemicals, i.e. the combined experts' judgement and evaluated experimental biodegradation data. This rule has good predictive ability and discloses logical dependencies between structural features that have a strong influence on biodegradation of organic chemicals.

J	Wang, CH; Hong, TP; Tseng, SS				Wang, CH; Hong, TP; Tseng, SS			Self-integrating knowledge-based brain tumor diagnostic system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article							ACQUISITION	In this paper we present a self-integrating knowledge-based expert system for brain tumor diagnosis. The system we propose comprises knowledge building, knowledge inference and knowledge refinement. During knowledge building, an automatic knowledge-integration process, based on Darwin's theory of natural selection, integrates knowledge derived from knowledge-acquisition tools and machine-learning methods to construct an initial knowledge base, thus eliminating a major bottleneck in developing a brain tumor diagnostic system. During the knowledge inference process, art inference engine exploits rules in the knowledge base to help diagnosticians determine brain tumor etiologies according to computer tomography pictures. And, a simple knowledge refinement method is proposed to modify the existing knowledge base during inference, which dramatically improves the accuracy of the derived rules. The performance of the brain tumor diagnostic system has been evaluated on actual brain tumor cases.

J	Aiba, H; Terano, T				Aiba, H; Terano, T			A computational model for distributed knowledge systems with learning mechanisms	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								This paper addresses the issues of machine learning in distributed knowledge systems, which will consist of distributed software agents with problem solving, communication and learning functions. To develop such systems, we must analyze the roles of problem-solving and communication capabilities among knowledge systems. To facilitate the analyses, we propose a computational model: LPC. The model consists of a set of agents with (a) a knowledge base for learned concepts, (b) a knowledge base for problem solving, (c) prolog-based inference mechanisms and (d) a set of beliefs on the reliability of the other agents. Each agent can improve its own problem-solving capabilities by deductive learning from the given problems, by memory-based learning from communications between the agents and by reinforcement learning from the reliability of communications between the other agents. An experimental system of the model has been implemented in prolog language on a Window-based personal computer Intensive experiments have been carried out to examine the feasibility of the machine learning mechanisms of agents for problem-solving and communication capabilities. The experimental results have shown that the multiagent system improves the performance of the whole system in problem solving, when each agent has a higher learning ability or when an agent with a very high ability for problem solving joins the organization to cooperate with the other agents in problem solving. These results suggest that the proposed model is useful in analyzing the learning mechanisms applicable to distributed knowledge systems.

J	Dangprasert, P; Avatchanakorn, V				Dangprasert, P; Avatchanakorn, V			Genetic algorithms based on an intelligent controller	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been proven as robust search procedures. Numerous researchers have established the validity of GAs in optimization, machine learning and control applications. This paper presents a new intelligent control scheme using the robust search feature of GAs incorporating the basic idea of self-tuning regulators. The proposed controller utilized GAs to search for the changes of system parameters and to calculate the corresponding control law. The optimum parameters and control law are chosen based on the selection mechanism of GAs, which employs the square of the difference between the actual and the estimated outputs as the fitness function. The controller has an on-line parameters identification function and does not require prior knowledge or training data for learning. The proposed intelligent controller is applied to the load frequency control of a power system to investigate the effectiveness from results obtained from computer simulations, the intelligent controller has been proven to provide good system characteristics.

Its central idea is to combine advanced inductive learning techniques with background domain knowledge in parallel multi-level image analysis and interpretation. The methodology is illustrated by a problem of learning how to conceptually interpret natural scenes. In the experiments described, three learning programs were employed: AQ15c-for learning decision rules from examples, NN-for neural net learning, and AQ-NN-for multistrategy learning that combines symbolic and neural net methods. Presented results illustrate the performance of the learning programs in Yearning to interpret natural scenes in terms of recognition accuracy, training time, recognition time, and complexity of the created descriptions. The methodology has proven to be very promising for the presented application. Overall, the experiments indicate that the multistrategy learning approach AQ-NN appears to be the most advantageous.

Reactive behavior, the second desirable feature of an autonomous robot, is needed to execute the actions in a dynamically changing environment. This paper presents the main components of the machine learning part of the autonomous robotic agent, the conceptual state generalization module that forms conceptual states as categories (clusters) of observation vectors obtained from the sensor system, and the robot behavior effects modeller that calculates the neat conceptual state from the current state and an action obtained from the action planner.

J	Litman, DJ				Litman, DJ			Cue phrase classification using machine learning	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for Performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (CGRENDEL and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods.		Litman, DJ (reprint author), AT&T BELL LABS,RES,600 MT AVE,MURRAY HILL,NJ 07974, USA.

J	Cohn, DA; Ghahramani, Z; Jordan, MI				Cohn, DA; Ghahramani, Z; Jordan, MI			Active learning with statistical models	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							REGRESSION	For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the statistically ''optimal'' way to select training data. In this paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.

J	Kaelbling, LP; Littman, ML; Moore, AW				Kaelbling, LP; Littman, ML; Moore, AW			Reinforcement learning: A survey	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Review							ALGORITHMS	This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ''reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.

J	Webb, GI				Webb, GI			Further experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor. A systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning.

In this paper, we develop a formal framework for learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions. We apply this framework to two different representations of learned knowledge, namely control rules and macro-operators, and prove theorems that identify sufficient conditions for learning in each representation. Our proofs are constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle.

J	Miller, JH				Miller, JH			The coevolution of automata in the repeated prisoner's dilemma	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						adaptation; evolution; learning; repeated prisoner's dilemma game; genetic algorithms; machine learning	FINITE AUTOMATA; REPEATED GAMES; EQUILIBRIUM	A model of learning and adaptation is used to analyze the coevolution of strategies in the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game under both perfect and imperfect reporting. Meta-players submit finite automata strategies and update their choices through an explicit evolutionary process modeled by a genetic algorithm. Using this framework, adaptive strategic choice and the emergence of cooperation are studied through 'computational experiments.' The results of the analyses indicate that information conditions lead to significant differences among the evolving strategies. Furthermore, they suggest that the general methodology may have much wider applicability to the analysis of adaptation in economic and social systems.

J	Schapire, RE; Warmuth, MK				Schapire, RE; Warmuth, MK			On the worst-case analysis of temporal-difference learning algorithms	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						machine learning; temporal-difference learning; on-line learning; worst-case analysis		We study the behavior of a family of learning algorithms based on Sutton's method of temporal differences. In our on-line learning framework, learning rakes place in a sequence of trials, and the goal of the learning algorithm is to estimate a discounted sum of all the reinforcements that will be received in the future. In this setting, we are able to prove general upper bounds on the performance of a slightly modified version of Sutton's so-called TD(lambda) algorithm. These bounds are stated in terms of the performance of the best linear predictor on the given training sequence, and are proved without making any statistical assumptions of any kind about the process producing the learner's observed training sequence. We also prove lower bounds on the performance of any algorithm for this learning problem, and give a similar analysis of the closely related problem of learning to predict in a model in which the learner must produce predictions for a whole batch of observations before receiving reinforcement.

An impressive variety of hand-crafted methods dealing with this difficult problem has been elaborated by both symbolic machine learning and neural networks communities. However, no fairly general methodology has emerged yet. The contribution of this paper is two-folded. First, we propose a Bayesian view of domain knowledge incorporation. In our framework the learning algorithm's designer is proposed to express available prior knowledge in terms of mixture distributions on both parameters and models envolved into a given type of learning. Then the known Bayesian learning machinery is put into work. Second, we fulfill a detailled case study applying our framework to extract logical rules from neural networks. We analyse our approach doing computational experiments on the difficult problem of protein secondary structure prediction. Besides, for this problem, we propose a Dirichlet mixture modeling of training data.

The drawbacks of this approach are mostly related to the knowledge acquisition techniques. To avoid this lengthy task an approach is proposed which? is based on using simplified process models and simulating their response at different faulty and non-faulty conditions Using the resulting set of learning examples iteratively through the learning cycle, an optimal decision tree with maximum classification? accuracy and simple structure can be generated. The approach and its features is studied on a simulated laboratory process.	Jozef Stefan Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia	Juricic, D (reprint author), Jozef Stefan Inst, Jamova 39, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

The implication's intensity enables to calculate the degree of the implication measured in reference to the probability's scale. Fitted to the field of symbolic learning, the implication's intensity supplies a test permitting to believe in the existence of an implication. This index seems to be particularly adapted to the field of learning. It resists noise, converges with the size of the sample, eliminates coarse rules, can be used within the framework of an incremental algorithm. In this article we intend to compare the intensity of implication with other indices frequently used in the literature.

In this paper, we show how implication intensity can be used in order to structure a set of propositions (or logical variables) and, finally, to discover rules. Three methods of organization are proposed. The first consists of drawing the implication graph. This graph shows the binary rules. In the second approach, we propose to construct a partial implicative hierarchy: the statistical implications are classified. The third approach extends the implication intensity to the conjunction of propositions. This allows us to establish an implicative classification between conjunctive propositions. The two last approaches offer complex and relevant rules.

The user rates explored pages on a three paint scale, and Syskill & Webert learns a user profile by analyzing the information on each page. The user profile can be used in two ways. First, it can be used to suggest which links a user would be interested in exploring. Second, it can be used to construct a LYCOS query to find pages that would interest a user. We compare six different algorithms from machine learning and information retrieval on this task. We find that the naive Bayesian classifier offers several advantages over other learning algorithms on this task. Furthermore, we find that an initial portion of a web page is sufficient for making predictions on its interestingness substantially reducing the amount of network transmission required to make predictions.

However, standard methods do not scale up to massive scientific and business data sets without expensive hardware. This paper investigates a practical alternative for scaling up: the use of distributed processing to take advantage of the often dormant Pes and workstations available on local networks. Each workstation runs a common rule-learning program on a subset of the data; We first show that for commonly used rule-evaluation criteria, a simple farm of cooperation can guarantee that a rule will look good to the set of cooperating learners if and only if it would look good to a single learner operating with the entire data set. We then show how such a system can further capitalize on different perspectives by sharing learned knowledge for significant reduction in search effort.

We illustrate a novel application of these techniques to the problem of constructing a student model for an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Our approach is implemented in an ITS authoring system called ASSERT which uses theory refinement to introduce errors into an initially correct knowledge base so that it models incorrect student behavior. The efficacy of the approach has been demonstrated by evaluating a tutor developed with ASSERT with 75 students tested on a classification task covering concepts from an introductory course on the C++ programming language. The system produced reasonably accurate models and students who received feedback based on these models performed significantly better on a post test than students who received simple reteaching.

The goal of the research described here is to build a system for generating comprehensible user profiles that accurately capture user interest with minimum user interaction. The research described here focuses on the importance of a suitable generalization hierarchy and representation for learning profiles which are predictively accurate and comprehensible. In our experiments we evaluated both traditional features based on weighted term vectors as well as subject features corresponding to categories which could be drawn from a thesaurus. Our experiments, conducted in the context of a content-based profiling system for on-line newspapers on the World Wide Web (the IDD News Browser), demonstrate the importance of a generalization hierarchy and the promise of combining natural language processing techniques with machine learning (ML) to address an information retrieval (IR) problem.

Constructive induction can mitigate representational inadequacies. This paper introduces the notion of a relative gain measure and describes a new constructive induction algorithm (GALA) which is independent of the learning algorithm. Unlike most previous research on constructive induction, our methods are designed as preprocessing step before standard machine learning algorithms are applied. We present the results which demonstrate the effectiveness of GALA on artificial and real domains for several learners: C4.5, CN2, perceptron and backpropagation.

In particular several standard test domains used in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are concerned with predicting numerical values from examples and relational and mostly non-determinate background knowledge. However, so far no ILP algorithm except one can predict numbers and cope with nondeterminate background knowledge. (The only exception is a covering algorithm called FORS.) In this paper we present Structural Regression Trees (SRT), a new algorithm which can be applied to the above class of problems. SRT integrates the statistical method of regression trees into ILP. It constructs a tree containing a literal (an atomic formula or its negation) or a conjunction of literals in each node, and assigns a numerical value to each leaf. SRT provides more comprehensible results than purely statistical methods, and can be applied to a class of problems most other ILP systems cannot handle. Experiments in several real-world domains demonstrate that the approach is competitive with existing methods, indicating that the advantages are not at the expense of predictive accuracy.

In real-life applications, the situation may not be as simple as that, particularly, when the user of the rules is a human being. The human user almost always has some previous concepts or knowledge about the domain represented by the dataset. Naturally, he/she wishes to know how the new rules compare with his/her existing knowledge. In dynamic domains where the rules may change over time, it is important to know what the changes are. These aspects of research have largely been ignored in the past. With the increasing use of machine learning techniques in practical applications such as data mining, this issue of post analysis of rules warrants greater emphasis and attention. In this paper, we propose a technique to deal with this problem. A system has been implemented to perform the post analysis of classification rules generated by systems such as C4.5. The proposed technique is general and highly interactive. It will be particularly useful in data mining and data analysis.

It involves determining how new and existing knowledge interact and how existing knowledge should be modified to accommodate the new information. KI is a machine learning program that performs knowledge integration. Through actively investigating the interaction of new information with existing knowledge KI is capable of detecting and exploiting a variety of diverse learning opportunities during a single learning episode. Empirical evaluation suggests that KI provides significant assistance to knowledge engineers while integrating new information into a large knowledge base.

This software system will be used in unattended operation to monitor the effect on frog populations of the introduced Cane Toad. The system is based around classification of local peaks in the spectrogram of the audio signal using Quinlan's machine learning system, C4.5(Quinlan 1993). Unreliable identifications of peaks are aggregated together using a hierarchical structure of segments based on the typical temporal vocalisation species' patterns.

The method in principle combines ordinary measurements, of ambient temperature, humidity and radiation, to calculate the control parameters of the humidification process in mist or fog propagation chambers. The new method is based on the fact that conditions of the microclimate are fully determined by the surrounding space, and implicitly relates the transfer phenomena between the two spaces through the setting of control parameters. The sum of products of the parameters with the measured macroclimatic variables provides an estimate of the moisture loss and determines the rate at which humidity should be supplied in the propagation chamber. An adaptive system, developed with a direct programming approach, guides the selection of control parameters to yield optimal system performance. The system is performance driven, conducts real experiments on the site and uses a modified descent method to maximise performance. The optimiser, after learning the best parameters values, updates a dictionary of parameters appropriate for each situation, which is recalled when conditions reoccur. Alternative performance functions are investigated taking into account the requirements of the physiological process of rooting and their implications regarding the microenvironment. The method is applicable to any system whose performance depends on a number of adjustable parameters. A mathematical model of the process is not necessary, as the learning system can be used whenever the performance can be measured by simulation or experiment.

Unfortunately, most real-world problems have to deal with such imperfect data. This paper presents a new model for fuzzy classification by integrating fuzzy classifiers with decision trees. In this approach, a fuzzy classification tree is constructed from the training data set. Instead of defining a specific class for a given instance, the proposed fuzzy classification scheme computes its degree of possibility for each class. The performance of the system is evaluated by empirically compared with a standard decision tree classifier C4.5 on several benchmark data sets the UCI machine learning repository.

Concept formation is defined as a machine learning task that captures concepts through categorizing the observation of objects and also uses them in classifying future experiences. A reasonable computational model of concept formation must reflect the characteristics of hum an concept learning and categorization. In this paper, the design and implementation of a fuzzy-set based concept formation system (FUZZ) is presented. The main feature of the FUZZ is that the concept hierarchy is non-disjoint, in which all instance may belong to two categories in different memberships. An information-theoretic evaluation measure called category binding to direct searches in the FUZZ is proposed. The learning and classification algorithms of the FUZZ are also given. In order to examine FUZZ's behavior, the results of some experiments are examined.

The process of configuring an ATR is currently very labor intensive, subjective and inaccurate, as is the process of training an ATR for a particular mission. An automated method of configuration and training which is capable of searching the N-dimensional space of modules, algorithms, and parameter values to produce the best ATR algorithm suites in each trained scenario cures this deficiency. Also, today's ATR is only capable of limited adaptation to changes in context during the mission. To improve the adaptability and useability of ATRs and thereby improve accuracy, robustness and acceptance, a high level control structure, which self-adapts to the mission context via changes in parameter values, changes in algorithms (at the component and at the 'suite' level), and control of the focus of attention of the processing, is desired. The Honeywell effort is producing a self-adaptive ATR system via context-based Configuration and Control, which addresses the above described problems. The software system is employing the machine learning technique of Genetic Algorithms and a Context Capture tool to autonomously and optimally perform configuration and training, and it is using Selective Perception software to provide run-time configuration and control of the ATR system.

Only limited work has been dane to study the effect of training set exemplar typicality on model performance, We present experimental results obtained in testing C4.5, SX-WEB, a backpropagation neural network ard linear discriminant analysis using a real-valued and a mixed form of a medical data set. We generated training sets of highly typical, widely-varied and atypical exemplars for both data sets. We tested the classification accuracy of each model using the generated training sera. Test set accuracy levels ranged between 76% and 86% when each model was trained with typical or varied training sets. The accuracy levels for C4.5, backpropagation neural net and discriminant analysis dropped significantly when atypical training sets were used, In contrast, with the exception of one test, SX-WEB was unaffected by training set choice.

J	Urbanczik, R				Urbanczik, R			A fully connected committee machine learning unrealizable rules	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							STORAGE CAPACITY; NETWORKS	We study generalization in a large fully connected committee machine with continuous weights trained on patterns with outputs generated by a teacher of the same structure but corrupted by noise. The corruption is due to additive Gaussian noise applied in the input layer or the hidden layer of the teacher. Contrary to related cases, in the presence of input noise the generalization error epsilon(g) is not minimized by the teacher's weights. For small Values of the load parameter alpha the student is in a permutation-symmetric phase. As alpha increases three additional phases emerge. The large-alpha theory of the stable phase is similar to the tree committee machine. In particular, at zero temperature in the presence of noise epsilon(g) does not approach its minimal value epsilon(min) and the student's weights do not converge to those of the teacher. For a positive temperature epsilon(g) - epsilon(min) decays as a power of alpha, the exponent being the same as in the corresponding case of the tree. However, for all values of alpha an at least metastable phase exists which is permutation symmetric with respect to the teacher.

In this paper, we will describe how can be used to develop a system able to forecast blood glucose concentration in patients affected by insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The major difference between our approach and the traditional ones is that probability distributions over the IBN are not provided by some human expert or by the current literature but they are directly extracted from a clinical database of IDDM patients. This choice capitalizes on the large amount of information generated by the daily control of blood glucose and allows the system to improve the accuracy of predictions as more information becomes available. We will show how, even with a very small subset of the information needed to specify a BBN, the IBN is able to carry out predictions about the future blood glucose concentration in a patient by explicitly taking into consideration the level of ignorance embedded in the network.

The fundamental tenet of goal-driven learning is that learning is largely an active and strategic process in which the learner, human or machine, attempts to identify and satisfy its information needs in the context of its tasks and goals, its prior knowledge, its capabilities, and environmental opportunities for learning. This article examines the motivations for adopting a goal-driven model of learning, the relationship between task goals and learning goals, the influences goals can have on learning, and the pragmatic implications of the goal-driven learning model. It presents a new integrative framework for understanding the goal-driven learning process and applies this framework to characterizing research on goal-driven learning.

J	WHITEHEAD, SD				WHITEHEAD, SD			AUTO-FAQ - AN EXPERIMENT IN CYBERSPACE LEVERAGING	COMPUTER NETWORKS AND ISDN SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International World-Wide Web Conference - Mosaic and the Web	OCT 17-20, 1994	CHICAGO, IL			QUESTION ANSWERING; INTELLIGENT AGENTS; CYBERSPACE LEVERAGING; MACHINE LEARNING; INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; WORLD-WIDE WEB; FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS; FAQ		Intelligent behavior requires, in one form or another, access to an enormous reservoir of knowledge and information. Unfortunately, intelligent systems are currently limited by a severe knowledge acquisition bottleneck. In most cases, the cost of getting knowledge is simply too high. Hand-coding is often too arduous or too time-consuming, while learning algorithms are often too slow or handcuffed by insufficient training data. This paper explores the idea of harnessing computer networks to overcame the knowledge acquisition bottleneck We introduce the idea of a CYLINA (CYberspace Leveraged INtelligent Agent)-an intelligent system that gains knowledge/information through interactions with a large population of network users. Instead of depending on the big efforts of a few knowledge engineers, CYLINAs rely on small, incremental contributions from a large population of experts. Our thesis is that the shear volume of interaction will allow significant knowledge to be acquired in a short amount of time. We consider potential applications for CYLINAs, then focus on Auto-FAQ, an experimental system currently under development at GTE Laboratories. Auto-FAQ is a question-answering system. Its intent is to make information typically found in USENET News FAQs much more accessible (It has many other uses as well.) Users ask questions in natural language forms. These questions index directly into the systems infobase. Infobase entries are question-answer pairs. Answers can be raw text, URLs, or Links into existing entries in the system's infobase. By using the system recursively, users can explore entire subjects with a series of questions. Facilities exist to tag gaps in the systems knowledge base. When a gap is found, it is posted to a public list. Individuals in the cyberspace community can search the list, volunteer expertise, and fill in gaps as appropriate. A version of Auto-FAQ is currently operating on a private network at GTE Laboratories. The system is currently able to answer basic questions about itself, WWW and Mosaic. Future plans are to make Auto-FAQ and its associated software available on the global Internet.

J	Okafor, AC; Adetona, O				Okafor, AC; Adetona, O			Predicting quality characteristics of end-milled parts based on multi-sensor integration using neural networks: Individual effects of learning parameters and rules	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						neural networks; quality engineering; sensor integration; machine learning	TOOL WEAR	Artificial neural networks have been shown to have a lot of potential as a means of integrating multi-sensor signals for real-time monitoring of machining processes. However, many questions still remain to be answered on how to optimize the training parameters during the training phase to optimize their subsequent performance, especially in view of the fact that the few published articles have made conflicting recommendations. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the individual effects of training parameters - learning rate, momentum rate, number of hidden layer nodes, transfer function and learning rule - on the performance of back-propagation networks used for predicting quality characteristics of end-milled parts. Multi-sensor signatures (acoustic emission, spindle vibration, cutting force components and machining time) acquired during circular end-milling of 4140 steel and the corresponding measured quality characteristics (surface roughness and bore tolerance) were used to train the networks. The network is part of a proposed intelligent machining monitoring and diagnostic system for quality assurance of machined parts. The network performances were evaluated using four different criteria: maximum error, rms error, mean error and number of training cycles. One of the results obtained shows that the hyperbolic tangent transfer function gives a better performance than the sigmoid and sine functions respectively. Optimum combinations of training parameters have been observed. The effects of various combinations of training parameters are presented.

J	CHEN, LG; GASTEIGER, J; ROSE, JR				CHEN, LG; GASTEIGER, J; ROSE, JR			AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF CHEMICAL KNOWLEDGE FROM ORGANIC-REACTION DATA - ADDITION OF CARBON-HYDROGEN BONDS TO CARBON-CARBON DOUBLE-BONDS	JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							REACTION PREDICTION; ELECTRONEGATIVITY; QUANTIFICATION; AFFINITY; SYSTEMS	Historically, chemists have gained a large portion of their understanding of chemical reactions through inductive learning and analogical reasoning by considering individual reactions. The advent of reaction databases supports the development of machine-learning techniques for the automatic acquisition of knowledge on chemical reactions. Hierarchical classification and generalization can collect similar reactions into a reaction type and detect those features-functional groups and electronic effects-that are necessary for a reaction type as well as those that are dispensable. HORACE, a system based on these principles, was applied to a dataset of 120 reactions involving the addition of a C-H bond to a C=C double bond, a reaction that comprises such important reaction types as Michael additions, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and free radical additions. The automatic classification of these reactions was able to find these and other important reaction types, indicated the scope and limitations of these reaction types, and discovered some more unusual processes.

Computerized predictive vegetation mapping is made possible by the availability of digital maps of topography and other environmental variables such as soils, geology and climate variables, and geographic information system software for manipulating these data. Especially important to predictive vegetation mapping are interpolated climatic variables related to physiological tolerances, and topographic variables, derived from digital elevation grids, related to site energy and moisture balance. Predictive vegetation mapping is founded in ecological niche theory and gradient analysis, and driven by the need to map vegetation patterns over large areas for resource conservation planning, and to predict the effects of environmental change on vegetation distributions. Predictive vegetation mapping has advanced over the past two decades especially in conjunction with the development of remote sensing-based vegetation mapping and digital geographic information analysis. A number of statistical and, more recently, machine-learning methods have been used to develop and implement predictive vegetation models.

The system (SKICAT) integrates new and existing packages for performing the full sequence of tasks from raw pixel processing, to object classification, to the matching of multiple, overlapping Schmidt plates and CCD calibration frames. We describe the relevant details of constructing SKICAT plate, CCD, matched, and object catalogs. Plate and CCD catalogs are generated from images, while the latter are derived from existing catalogs. A pair of programs complete the majority of plate and CCD processing in an automated, pipeline fashion, with the user required to execute a minimal number of pre- and post-processing procedures. We apply a modified version of FOCAS for the detection and photometry, and new software for matching catalogs on an object-by-object basis. SKICAT employs modern machine-learning techniques, such as decision trees, to perform automatic star-galaxy-artifact classification with a >90% accuracy down to similar to 1 mag above the plate detection limit. The system also provides a variety of tools for interactively querying and analyzing the resulting object catalogs.		Weir, N (reprint author), CALTECH,PALOMAR OBSERV,PASADENA,CA 91125, USA.

J	Cohen, WW				Cohen, WW			Pac-learning non-recursive Prolog clauses	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; inductive logic programming; pac-learning	PREDICTION	Recently there has been an increasing amount of research on learning concepts expressed in subsets of Prolog; the term inductive logic programming (ILP) has been used to describe this growing body of research. This paper seeks to expand the theoretical foundations of ILP by investigating the pac-learnability of logic programs. We focus on programs consisting of a single function-free non-recursive clause, and focus on generalizations of a language known to be pac-learnable: namely, the language of determinate function-free clauses of constant depth. We demonstrate that a number of syntactic generalizations of this language are hard to learn, but that the language can be generalized to clauses of constant locality while still allowing pac-learnability. More specifically, we first show that determinate clauses of log depth are not pac-learnable, regardless of the language used to represent hypotheses. We then investigate the effect of allowing indeterminacy in a clause, and show that clauses with k indeterminate variables are as hard to learn as DNF. We next show that a more restricted language of clauses with bounded indeterminacy is learnable using k-CNF to represent hypotheses, and that restricting the ''locality'' of a clause to a constant allows pac-learnability even if an arbitrary amount of indeterminacy is allowed. This last result is also shown to be a strict generalization of the previous result for determinate function-free clauses of constant depth. Finally, we present some extensions of these results to logic programs with multiple clauses.		Cohen, WW (reprint author), AT&T BELL LABS, 600 MT AVE, MURRAY HILL, NJ 07974 USA.

J	Mulholland, M; Hibbert, DB; Haddad, PR; Parslov, P				Mulholland, M; Hibbert, DB; Haddad, PR; Parslov, P			A comparison of classification in artificial intelligence, induction versus a self-organising neural networks	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; classification; artificial intelligence; ion chromatography; expert systems	MASS-SPECTRA; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; EXPERT SYSTEM	Three methods of classification (machine learning) were used to produce a program to choose a detector for ion chromatography (IC). The selected classification systems were: C4.5, an induction method based on an information theory algorithm; INDUCT, which is based on a probability algorithm and a self-organising neural network developed specifically for this application. They differ both in the learning strategy employed to structure the knowledge, and the representation of knowledge acquired by the system, i.e., rules, decision trees and a neural network. A database of almost 4000 cases, that covered most IC experiments reported in the chemical literature in the period 1979 to 1989, comprised the basis for the development of the system. Generally, all three algorithms performed very well for this application. They managed to induce rules, or produce a network that had about a 70% success rate for the prediction of detectors reported in the publication and over 90% success for choosing a detector that could be used for the described method. This was considered acceptable due to the nature of the problem domain and that of the training set. Each method effectively handled the very high noise levels in the training set and was able to select the relevant attributes.

This paper proposes an alternative to the multiple constraints approach. By drawing analogy with machine learning, motion is computed as a function that accurately predicts frames, The Occam-Razor principle suggests that among all functions that accurately predict the second frame from the first frame, the best predictor is the ''simplest,'' and simplicity can be rigorously defined in terms of encoding length. An implementation of a practical algorithm is described. Experiments with real video sequences verify the algorithm assumptions by showing that motion in typical sequences can be accurately described in terms of a few parameters. Our particular choice of predictors produces results that compare very favorably with other image flow algorithms in terms of accuracy and compactness. It may, however, be too constrained to enable accurate recovery of 3D motion and structure.

Because crystallography leads to reports of a single (or sometimes dual) position for each atom, the significance of any structural change based on comparison of two structures depends critically on knowing the expected precision of each median atomic position reported, and on extracting it for each atom, from the information provided in the Protein Data Bank and in the publication. The differences between structures of protein molecules that should be identical, and that are normally distributed, indicating that they are not affected by crystal contacts, were analyzed with respect to many potential indicators of structure precision, so as to extract, essentially by ''machine learning'' principles, a generally applicable expression involving the highest correlates. Eighteen refined crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank, in which there are multiple molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, were selected and compared. The thermal B factor, the connectivity of the atom, and the ratio of the number of reflections to the number of atoms used in refinement correlate best with the magnitude of the positional differences between regions of the structures that otherwise would be expected to be the same. These results are embodied in a six-parameter equation that can be applied to any crystallographically refined structure to estimate the expected uncertainty in position of each atom. Structure change in a macromolecule can thus be referenced to the expected uncertainty in atomic position as reflected in the variance between otherwise identical structures with the observed values of correlated parameters.

J	REIGNIER, P				REIGNIER, P			SUPERVISED INCREMENTAL LEARNING OF FUZZY RULES	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Intelligent Robotics Systems (SIRS 95)	JUL 11-15, 1994	GRENOBLE, FRANCE					This paper is concerned with on-going research results on fuzzy logic and learning. The general context of this study is reactive navigation in mobile robotics. Reactive navigation can be defined as a mapping between perception and action. Because there exists no exact model of the system to control, it is not possible to determine mathematically what command the robot should receive to act in a proper way. Machine learning and more precisely reinforcement learning seems to be a promising research axis to solve this problem. Learning to drive a robot is a complicated task. Some initial knowledge must be embedded inside the system to help it. This is done using fuzzy logic. One of the fundamental components of such a system is the supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is responsible for learning the critical module of the reinforcement scheme, using the Sutton approach. Existing supervised algorithms for fuzzy logic are not adapted to specific robotic constraints. They are non-incremental or (and) use a limited fixed structure (the number of rules cannot grow for instance). This paper proposes an algorithm that overcomes these limitations.

First, we summarize several incremental improvements to the original algorithm that improve its efficiency significantly and provide the user with some ability to influence what motions are generated. These techniques can be used by an animator to achieve a desired movement style, or they can be used to guarantee variety in the motions synthesized over several runs of the algorithm. Second, we report on new mechanisms that support the concatenation of existing, automatically generated motion controllers to produce complex, composite movement. Finally, we describe initial work on generalizing the techniques from 2D to 3D articulated figures. Taken together, these results illustrate the promise and challenges afforded by the controller-based approach to automatic motion synthesis for computer animation.

J	BHANU, B; LEE, S; DAS, S				BHANU, B; LEE, S; DAS, S			ADAPTIVE IMAGE SEGMENTATION USING GENETIC AND HYBRID SEARCH METHODS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article							REGION	This paper describes an adaptive approach for the important image processing problem of image segmentation that relies on learning from experience to adapt and improve the segmentation performance. The adaptive image segmentation system incorporates a feedback loop consisting of a machine learning subsystem an image segmentation algorithm, and an evaluation component which determines segmentation quality. The machine learning component is based on genetic adaptation and uses (separately) a pure genetic algorithm (GA) and a hybrid of GA and hill climbing (HC). When the learning subsystem is based on pure genetics, the corresponding evaluation component is based on a vector of evaluation criteria For the hybrid case, the system employs a scalar evaluation measure which is a weighted combination of the different criteria Experimental results for pure genetic and hybrid search methods are presented using a representative, database of outdoor TV imagery, The multiobjective optimization demonstrates the ability of the adaptive image segmentation system to pro,ide high quality segmentation results in a minimal number of generations. The results of the hybrid method show the performance improvement over the pure GA.

J	ZHOU, XJM; DILLON, TS				ZHOU, XJM; DILLON, TS			THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF UNCERTAINTY AND COMPLEXITY IN AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						COMPLEXITY; DECISION TREES; DISJUNCTIVE NORMAL FORMS; KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; MACHINE LEARNING; UNCERTAINTY	RECOGNITION; CHARACTER	Inductive machine learning has become an important approach to automated knowledge acquisition from databases. The disjunctive normal form (DNF), as the common analytic representation of decision trees and decision tables (rules), provides a basis for formal analysis of uncertainty and complexity in inductive learning. In this paper, a theory for general decision trees is developed based on Shannon's expansion of the discrete DNF, and a probabilistic induction system PIK is further developed for extracting knowledge from real-world data. Then we combine formal and practical approaches to study how data characteristics affect the uncertainty and complexity in inductive learning. Three important data characteristics, namely, disjunctiveness, noise and incompleteness, are studied. The combination of leveled-pruning, leveled-condensing and resampling-estimation turns out to be a very powerful method for dealing with highly-disjunctive and inadequate data.

Conceptual clustering may be used to automate or assist the engineer in the creation of such a classification structure. This article introduces a new conceptual clustering method which addresses the problem of clustering large amounts of structured objects. The conditions under which the method is applicable are discussed.

The conventional method, using a decision tree, applies only to discrete attribute values, To apply it to fault diagnosis of power distribution lines, in practice it must be revised in order to treat attributes whose values range over certain widths, This is because the sensor value or attribute value varies owing to the resistance of the fault point or is influenced by noise, The proposed method is useful when the attribute value has such a property, and it takes into consideration the cost of acquiring the information and the probability of the occurrence of a fault.

J	Mitrovic, A; DjordjevicKajan, S				Mitrovic, A; DjordjevicKajan, S			Interactive reconstructive student modeling: A machine-learning approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							METHODOLOGY	Reconstructive bug modeling is a well-known approach to student modeling in intelligent tutoring systems, suitable for modeling procedural tasks. Domain knowledge is decomposed into the set of primitive operators and the set of conditions of their applicability. Reconstructive modeling is capable of describing errors that come from irregular application of correct operators. The main obstacle to successfulness of this approach is such decomposition of domain knowledge to primitive operators with a very low level of abstraction so that bugs could never occur within them. The other drawback of this modeling scheme is its efficiency because it is usually done offline, due to vast search spaces involved. This article reports a novel approach to reconstructive modeling based on machine-learning techniques for inducing procedures from traces. The approach overcomes the problems of reconstructive modeling by its interactive nature. It allows online model generation by using domain knowledge and knowledge about the student to focus the search on the portion of the problem space the student is likely to traverse while solving the problem. Furthermore, the approach is not only incremental,but also truly interactive because it involves the student in explicit dialogs about his or her goals. In such a way, it is possible to determine whether the student knows the operator he or she is trying to apply. Pedagogical actions and the student model are generated interchangeably, thus allowing for dynamic adaptation of instruction, problem generation, and immediate feedback on student's errors. The approach presented is examined in the context of the symbolic integration tutoring system (SINT), an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for the domain of symbolic integration.

J	NUNEZ, G; CORTES, U; LARROSA, J				NUNEZ, G; CORTES, U; LARROSA, J			NONMONOTONIC CHARACTERIZATION OF INDUCTION AND ITS APPLICATION TO INDUCTIVE LEARNING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							CIRCUMSCRIPTION	In this article a new approach to the formalization of inductive inference in terms of non-monotonic inference is proposed. Induction is characterized as closed-world reasoning from the available data, followed by an inductive jump, which consists in assuming that valid conclusions in the database (assuming closed-world) hold also in the rest of the world. This conception of induction results is adequate to characterize those inference processes that could be formalized, that is, those based in analytical procedures of pattern-matching or regularity detection in the available data. The proposed characterization formally describes the implicit deductive processes of induction and its non-monotonic nature, and could he used as an abstract model of the mental process that leads to obtaining inductive hypotheses. This proposal reduces the problem of induction automatization to that of deduction automatization. Also, it constitutes a formal framework that covers several inductive inference methods used in machine learning. Besides it formalizes inductive definitions, which are very common in science and computer science. (C) 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	CALLAHAN, SM; VOLAND, G				CALLAHAN, SM; VOLAND, G			EXTRACTING KNOWLEDGE FROM EXAMPLES - INDUCTION OF HEURISTIC RULES FOR WHEELCHAIR PRESCRIPTION	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						WHEELCHAIR PRESCRIPTION; ID3; MACHINE LEARNING; EXPERT SYSTEM; REHABILITATION; EQUIPMENT SELECTION; INDUCTION		The feasibility of using an induction algorithm to discover heuristic rules for wheelchair equipment selection is investigated. Syntactical rules for two description languages (one to describe the disabled client and another to describe wheelchair equipment configurations) are presented. These languages allow the rulebase developer to describe training instances (examples) to the computer in an intelligible way. An induction learning algorithm is used to classify these training instances, thereby producing a decision tree. Heuristic rules can then be extracted from the tree and placed in a rulebase for an expert system called LEADER. LEADER is being developed to aid a wheelchair prescriber in the equipment selection process. There are two important objectives of this research: (1) to reduce the time and facilitate the development of an intelligent expert system rulebase by extracting knowledge embedded within existing examples and (2) to provide the expert system with the ability to learn new rules autonomously. The ability to learn makes the rulebase dynamic; the initial rulebase would be augmented with new rules as additional examples are provided to the system while it is in clinical use.

The automated discovery of recurrent patterns of structure and sequence is an essential part of this investigation. These patterns, known as protein motifs, are abstractions of fragments drawn from proteins of known sequence and tertiary structure. This paper has two objectives. The first is to introduce and define protein motifs, and provide a survey of previous research on protein motif discovery. The second is to present and apply a novel approach to protein motif representation and discovery, which is based on a spatial description logic and the symbolic machine learning paradigm of structured concept formation. A large database of protein fragments is processed using this approach, and several interesting and significant protein motifs are discovered.

The homology modeling approach uses a protein database to identify fold-class relationships by sequence similarity. The main limitation of this method is that some proteins with similar structures appear to have very different sequences, which we call the ''hidden-homology problem.'' As in other real-world domains for machine learning, this difficulty may be caused by a low-level representation. Learning in such domains can be improved by using domain knowledge to search for representations that better match the inductive bias of a preferred algorithm. In this domain, knowledge of amino acid properties can be used to construct higher-level representations of protein sequences. In one experiment using a 179-protein data set, the accuracy of fold-class prediction was increased from 77.7% to 81.0%. The search results are analyzed to refine the grouping of small residues suggested by Dayhoff. Finally, an extension to the representation incorporates sequential context directly into the representation, which can express finer relationships among the amino acids. The methods developed in this domain are generalized into a framework that suggests several systematic roles for domain knowledge in machine learning. Knowledge may define both a space of alternative representations, as well as a strategy for searching this space. The search results may be summarized to extract feedback for revising the domain knowledge.

J	THAM, CK				THAM, CK			REINFORCEMENT LEARNING OF MULTIPLE TASKS USING A HIERARCHICAL CMAC ARCHITECTURE	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						MACHINE LEARNING; REINFORCEMENT LEARNING; MODULAR NEURAL NETWORKS; ROBOTICS; CONTEXT-DEPENDENT LEARNING		A reinforcement learning approach based on modular function approximation is presented. Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) networks are incorporated in the Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts (HME) architecture and the resulting architecture is referred to as HME-CMAC. A computationally efficient on-line learning algorithm based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed in order to achieve fast function approximation with the HME-CMAC architecture. The Compositional Q-Learning (CQ-L) framework establishes the relationship between the Q-values of composite tasks and those of elemental tasks in its decomposition. This framework is extended here to allow rewards in non-terminal states. An implementation of the extended CQ-L framework using the HME-CMAC architecture is used to perform task decomposition in a realistic simulation of a two-linked manipulator having non-linear dynamics. The context-dependent reinforcement learning achieved by adopting this approach has advantages over monolithic approaches in terms of speed of learning, storage requirements and the ability to cope with changing goals.

J	THRUN, S				THRUN, S			AN APPROACH TO LEARNING MOBILE ROBOT NAVIGATION	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING; MOBILE ROBOTS; MACHINE LEARNING; NAVIGATION; NEURAL NETWORKS; PERCEPTION		This paper describes an approach to learning an indoor robot navigation task through trial-and-error. A mobile robot, equipped with visual, ultrasonic and laser sensors, learns to servo to a designated target object. In less than ten minutes of operation time, the robot is able to navigate to a marked target object in an office environment. The central learning mechanism is the explanation-based neural network learning algorithm (EBNN). EBNN initially learns function purely inductively using neural network representations. With increasing experience, EBNN employs domain knowledge to explain and to analyze training data in order to generalize in a more knowledgeable way. Here EBNN is applied in the context of reinforcement learning, which allows the robot to learn control using dynamic programming.

Given a relation I, find a set of functional dependencies that is equivalent with the set of all functional dependencies holding in r. All known algorithms for this task have running times that can be in the worst case exponential in the size of the smallest cover of the dependency set. We consider approximate dependency inference. We define various measures for the error of a dependency in a relation. These error measures have the value 0 if the dependency holds and a value close to 1 if the dependency clearly does not hold. Depending on the measure used, all dependencies with error at least epsilon in r can be detected with high probability by considering only 0(1/epsilon) or 0(/r/(1/2)/epsilon) random tuples of v. We also show how a machine learning algorithm due to Angluin et al. can be applied to give in output-polynomial time an approximately correct cover for the set of dependencies holding in v.

These preferences especially concern the trade-off between different kinds of costs and performance indicators of the classification scheme to be developed. We analyze what knowledge, provided by the user, can be used at various stages of the machine learning process to influence the development of the classifier. We restrict ourselves in this paper mainly to the generation of classification trees.

There is need for a unified definitional model of data, information, and knowledge based on their roles in computational and cognitive information processing. An attempt to clarify these basic notions is made, and a conceptual framework for integration is suggested by focusing on their different roles and frames of reference within a decision-making process. On this basis, ways of integrating the functionalities of databases, information systems and knowledge-based systems are discussed by taking a knowledge level perspective to the analysis and modeling of systems behaviour. Motivated by recent work in the area of case-based reasoning related to decision support systems, it is further shown that a specific problem solving episode, or case, may be viewed as data, information, or knowledge, depending on its role in decision making and learning from experience. An outline of a case-based system architecture is presented, and used to show that a focus on the retaining and reuse of past cases facilitates a gradual and evolutionary transition from an information system to a knowledge-based system.

J	STEFANUK, VL				STEFANUK, VL			LEARNING-LEVELS IN INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						INTELLIGENT TUTORING; EDUCATION PROCESS; KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS; LEARNING LEVELS; MACHINE LEARNING		Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) represents a wide class of computer based tutoring systems, designed with an extensive use of the technology of modern Artificial Intelligence. Successful applications of various expert systems and other knowledge based systems of AI gave rise to a new wave of interests to ITS. Yet, many authors conclude that practically valuable achievements of ITS are rather modest despite the relatively long history of attempts to use knowledge based systems for tutoring. It is advocated in this paper that some basic obstacles for designing really successful ITS are due to the lack of well understood and sound models of the education process. The paper proposes to overcome these problems by borrowing the required models from AI and adjacent fields. In particular, the concept of Learning Levels from AI might be very useful both for giving a valuable retrospective analysis of computer based tutoring and for suggestion of some perspective directions in the field of ITS.

Firstly, we provide a brief and fundamental description of what is nowadays called local search. Components which have meanwhile become an integral part of the classical aspects on simulated annealing, tabu search and genetic algorithms are reviewed. Furthermore, today tabu search can be considered as the major pillar of local search. Hence, attention is drawn to a couple of tabu search issues more recently developed such as the reverse elimination method and ejection chains. Secondly, local search based knowledge engineering is developed to constitute a substantial part of knowledge based information systems. Within this general setting local search will be considered as one particular paradigm of machine learning. Thirdly, we are going to introduce what is considered to be the main subject of this issue, local search applications. We briefly embed the contents of the subsequent papers and group them with respect to their particular methods and models within the above mentioned framework.

The output from such models is intended to be used as information that supports risk assessments performed on toxic substances. Speakers gave special attention to the requirements and applications of hazard identification models. Specific aspects of the broad subject matter were augmented and explicated by audience and panel discussions during the 1.5 days available. This format stimulated the exchange of a surprisingly broad range of information and stimulating ideas.

Now, computer-based analytical techniques can objectively and accurately measure size, shape and texture features, which constitute nuclear grade. The cell samples used in this study were obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) during the diagnosis of 187 consecutive patients with invasive breast cancer. Regions of FNA preparations to be analyzed were digitized and displayed on a computer monitor. Nuclei to be analyzed were roughly outlined by an operator using a mouse. Next, the computer generated a ''snake'' that precisely enclosed each designated nucleus. Ten nuclear features were then calculated for each nucleus based on these snakes. These results were analyzed statistically and by an inductive machine learning technique that we developed and call ''recurrence surface approximation'' (RSA). Both the statistical and RSA machine learning analyses demonstrated that computer-derived nuclear features are prognostically move important than are the classic prognostic features, tumor size and lymph node status.

Methods and Results: Artificial intelligence (AI) is characterized by its ability to deal with incomplete and imprecise information and to accumulate knowledge. Expert systems, building on standard computing techniques, depend heavily on the domain experts and knowledge engineers that have programmed them to represent the real world. Neural networks are intended to emulate the pattern-recognition and parallel processing capabilities of the human brain and are taught rather than programmed. The future may lie in a combination of the recognition ability of the neural network and the rationalization capability of the expert system. In the second part of this paper, examples are given of applications of AI in stand-alone systems for knowledge engineering and medical diagnosis and in embedded systems for failure detection, image analysis, user interfacing, natural language processing, robotics and machine learning, as related to clinical laboratories. Conclusion: AI constitutes a collective form of intellectual property, and that there is a need for better documentation, evaluation and regulation of the systems already being used widely in clinical laboratories.

CEG is a blackboard based system that supports case evidence generation and acquisition. It can be used to define case decision classes, to model case knowledge elements, to represent prototypical case features and cases, to index cases according to decision classes or prototypical case realizations and to model elements of bias or error in case representation. We place CEG in the context of multicriteria decision making and draw architectural components from Machine Learning. We give an overview of CEG and CEG knowledge components. We demonstrate CEG by means of two 'real world' decision making exemplars drawn from retail sales evaluation and medical decision making. Finally, we explore architectural properties and discuss the potential for further research on the subject.

J	CLYMER, JR				CLYMER, JR			SYSTEM-DESIGN AND EVALUATION USING DISCRETE-EVENT SIMULATION WITH AI	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						SIMULATION; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; CYBERNETICS; SYSTEMS ENGINEERING; CONTEXT SENSITIVE SYSTEMS		During system design and evaluation, development of optimal decision making rules for an intelligent system can be very difficult. The Operational Evaluation Modeling (OpEM) Fuzzy, Adaptive Expert System Controller, integrated into the OpEM Simulation Tool Kit, has greatly facilitated this task. The rule specification language for Controller consists of all primitives needed to implement local and global decision making. These primitives include fuzzy facts to transform analog variables into discrete concepts and variable instantiation of facts to consider lists of facts in context sensitive, global decisions. A single-track railroad system is evaluated as an example context sensitive system, and other methods of decision making are compared with OpEM. Future research is discussed that adds a machine learning module to Controller, called Supervisor, to automatically search for better decision making rules.

J	DRAKE, KC; KIM, RY				DRAKE, KC; KIM, RY			HIERARCHICAL INTEGRATION OF SENSOR DATA AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION FOR AUTOMATIC TARGET RECOGNITION	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						AUTOMATIC TARGET RECOGNITION; MACHINE LEARNING; ABDUCTIVE POLYNOMIAL NETWORKS; EXPERT SYSTEMS; INFORMATION FUSION	MOMENTS	Real-time assessment of high-value targets is an ongoing challenge for the defense community. Many automatic target recognition (ATR) approaches exist, each with specific advantages and limitations. An ATR system is presented here that integrates machine learning, expert systems, and other advanced image understanding concepts. The ATR system employs a hierarchical strategy relying primarily on abductive polynomial networks at each level of recognition. Advanced feature extraction algorithms are used at each level for pixel characterization and target description. Polynomial networks process feature data and situational information, providing input for subsequent levels of processing. An expert system coordinates individual recognition modules. Heuristic processing of object likelihood estimates is also discussed. Here, separate estimators determine the likelihood that an object belongs to a particular class. Heuristic knowledge to resolve ambiguities that occur when more than one class appears likely is discussed. In addition, a comparison of model-based recognition with the primary polynomial network approach is presented. Model-based recognition is a goal-driven approach that compares a representation of the unknown target to a reference library of known targets. Each approach has advantages and limitations that should be considered for a specific implementation. This ATR approach can potentially overcome limitations of current systems such as catastrophic degradation during unanticipated operating conditions, while meeting strict processing requirements. These benefits result from implementation of robust feature extraction algorithms that do not take explicit advantage of peculiar characteristics of the sensor imagery; and the compact, real-time processing capability provided by abductive polynomial networks.

These systems have generally been developed in isolation and demonstrate much variation in their design. Some systems are purely database applications designed to take advantage of computer technology in order to provide up to date syndrome compendia. Conversely, a number of research projects have endeavoured to build an intelligent system that can formulate a diagnosis, either through its own knowledge-base, or through interaction with an expert user. This report reviews computer systems in dysmorphology with reference to these two alternative design methodologies. The London Dysmorphology Database and POSSUM provide case studies in a standard database approach. The Skeletal Dysplasia Diagnostician (SDD) is described in order to demonstrate how an expert system might operate in dysmorphology. Other work in the field is reviewed in terms of the common and distinctive aspects of their design with respect to the three aforenamed systems.

It presents a knowledge-based system (KBS) verification approach that considers system specifications and, consequently, knowledge bases to be partially described when development starts. This partial description is not necessarily perfect, and our work aims at using machine learning techniques to progressively acquire new knowledge and then improve the quality of expert system knowledge bases (KB) by coping with two major KB anomalies; incompleteness and incorrectness.

These features are then used to distinguish between benign and malignant breast cytology. The benign and malignant cell samples used in this study were obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) from a consecutive series of 569 patients: 212 with cancer and 357 with fibrocystic breast masses. Regions of FNA preparations to be analyzed were converted by a video camera to computer files that were displayed on a computer monitor, Nuclei to be analyzed were roughly outlined by an operator using a mouse. Next, the computer generated a ''snake'' that precisely enclosed each designated nucleus. The computer calculated 10 features for each nucleus, The ability to correctly classify samples as benign or malignant on the basis of these features was determined by inductive machine learning and logistic regression, Cross-validation was used to test the validity of the predicted diagnosis. The logistic regression cross validated classification accuracy was 96.2% and the inductive machine learning cross-validated classification accuracy was 97.5%. Our computerized system provides a probability that a sample is malignant, Should this probability fall between 30% and 70%, the sample is considered ''suspicious,'' in the same way a visually graded FNA may be termed suspicious. All of the 128 consecutive cases obtained since the introduction of this system were correctly diagnosed, but nine benign aspirates fell into the suspicious category. Fifty-seven FNAs were obtained that had been visually diagnosed elsewhere by others as ''suspicious.'' Eleven (19.3%) were similarly classified as suspicious by the computer, but 84.8% of the remaining samples were correctly diagnosed, The methods described in this article will provide the basis for computerized systems to diagnose breast cytology.

The present paper contributes to the theory by considering the situation in which observations are dependent, To begin with, the dependency is presumed to depend only on past observations of the same arm, but later, we allow that it may be with respect to the entire past and that the set of arms is infinite, This brings queues and, more generally, controlled Markov processes into our purview, Thus our ''black-box'' methodology is suitable for the case when the only observables are cost values and, in particular, the probability structure and loss function are unknown to the designer. The conclusion of the analysis is that under lenient conditions, using algorithms prescribed herein, risk growth is commensurate with that in the simplest i,i,d, cases. Our methods represent an alternative to recent stochastic-approximation/perturbation-analysis ideas for tuning queues.

At any time the system can adopt a particular strategy or decide to gather additional information at some cost. Balancing the expected utility of the new information against the cost of acquiring the information is the central problem we address. In our approach, the cost and utility of applying a particular strategy to a given problem are represented as random variables from a parametric distribution. By observing the performance of each strategy on a randomly selected sample of problems, we can use parameter estimation techniques to infer statistical models of performance on the general population of problems. These models can then be used to estimate: 1) the utility and cost of acquiring additional information and 2) the desirability of selecting a particular strategy from a set of choices. Empirical results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the hypothesis evaluation techniques for tuning system parameters in a NASA antenna scheduling application.

One approach which has been advocated is the systematic use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, ML technology poses difficulties to domain experts and knowledge engineers who are not familiar with it. This paper discusses Consultant-2, a system which makes a first step towards providing system support for a ''pre- and post-processing'' methodology where a cyclic process of experiments with an ML tool, its data, data description language and parameters attempts to optimize learning performance. Consultant-2 has been developed to support the use of Machine Learning Toolbox (MLT), an integrated architecture of 10 ML tools, and has evolved from a series of earlier systems. Consultant-0 and Consultant-1 had knowledge only about how to choose an ML algorithm based on the nature of the domain data. Consultant-2 is the most sophisticated. It, additionally, has knowledge about how ML experts and domain experts pre-process domain data before a run with the ML algorithm, and how they further manipulate the data and reset parameters after a run of the selected ML algorithm, to achieve a more acceptable result. How these several KBs were acquired and encoded is described. In fact, this knowledge has been acquired by interacting both with the ML algorithm developers and with domain experts who had been using the MLT toolbox on real-world tasks. A major aim of the MLT project was to enable a domain expert to use the toolbox directly; i.e. without necessarily having to involve either a ML specialist or a knowledge engineer. Consultant's principal goal was to provide specific advice to ease this process.

J	KORB, KB				KORB, KB			INDUCTIVE LEARNING AND DEFEASIBLE INFERENCE	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						INDUCTIVE INFERENCE; AMPLIATIVE INFERENCE; DEFEASIBLE REASONING; NONMONOTONIC REASONING; BAYESIANISM; MACHINE LEARNING; LOGICISM; EPISTEMOLOGY; LOTTERY PARADOX; HYBRID REASONING	CIRCUMSCRIPTION; KNOWLEDGE	The symbolic approach to artificial intelligence research has dominated AI until recent times. It continues to dominate work in the areas of inference and reasoning in artificial systems. The author argues, however, that non-quantitative methods are inherently insufficient for supporting inductive inference. In particular there are reasons to believe that purely deductive techniques-as advocated by the naive physics community-and their nonmonotonic progeny are insufficient for supplying means for the development of the autonomous intelligence that AI has as its primary goal. The lottery paradox points to fundamental difficulties for any such non-quantitative approach to AI. Here, it is suggested that a hybrid system employing both quantitative and non-quantitative modes of reasoning is the most promising avenue for developing an intelligence that can avoid both the paralysis induced by computational complexity and the inductive paralysis to which purely symbolic approaches succumb.

J	MUGNIER, ML				MUGNIER, ML			ON GENERALIZATION SPECIALIZATION FOR CONCEPTUAL GRAPHS	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						SUBSUMPTION; CONCEPTUAL GRAPHS; LABELED GRAPHS; GRAPH MORPHISMS; POLYNOMIAL ALGORITHMS		This paper centres on the generalization/specialization relation in the framework of conceptual graphs (this relation corresponds to logical subsumption when considering logical formulas associated with conceptual graphs). Results given here apply more generally to any model where knowledge is described by labelled graphs and reasoning is based on graph subsumption, as in semantic networks or in structural machine learning. The generalization/specialization relation, as defined by Sowa, is first precisely analysed, in particular its links with a graph morphism, called projection. Besides Sowa's specialization relation (which is a preorder), another one is actually used in some practical applications (which is an order). These are comparatively studied. The second topic of this paper is the design of efficient algorithms for computing these specialization relations. Since the associated problems are NP-hard, the form of the graphs is restricted in order to arrive at polynomial algorithms. In particular, polynomial algorithms are presented for computing a projection from a conceptual 'tree' to any conceptual graph, and for counting the number of such projections. The algorithms are also described in a generic way, replacing the projection by a parametrized graph morphism, and conceptual graphs by directed labelled graphs.

J	REICH, Y; FENVES, SJ				REICH, Y; FENVES, SJ			SYSTEM THAT LEARNS TO DESIGN CABLE-STAYED BRIDGES	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								The critical design decisions in bridge design are made at the preliminary design stage. They depend on the expertise of the designer, built up from extensive experience. Experience is difficult to acquire, and may be entirely lacking when new technology is introduced. As a result, there is little shareable and transferable collective design knowledge within the profession. This paper explores how preliminary design knowledge may be generated, updated, and used, employing techniques of machine learning from the field of artificial intelligence. A model of the preliminary design process is first presented as a sequence of five tasks and then specialized to the design of cable-stayed bridges. A computer tool serving as a design support system is described, whose design follows the model of the preliminary design process, and a design example using the tool is presented. The key property of the system is its adaptive nature: it acquires knowledge from information on existing bridges as well as from designs generated with the system, thereby continuously improving its performance. Future enhancements to the tool breadth and depth are offered.

J	TURNEY, P				TURNEY, P			BIAS AND THE QUANTIFICATION OF STABILITY	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Note						STABILITY; BIAS; ACCURACY; REPEATABILITY; AGREEMENT; SIMILARITY		Research on bias in machine learning algorithms has generally been concerned with the impact of bias on predictive accuracy. We believe that there are other factors that should also play a role in the evaluation of bias. One such factor is the stability of the algorithm; in other words, the repeatability of the results. If we obtain two sets of data from the same phenomenon, with the same underlying probability distribution, then we would like our learning algorithm to induce approximately the same concepts from both sets of data. This paper introduces a method for quantifying stability, based on a measure of the agreement between concepts. We also discuss the relationships among stability, predictive accuracy, and bias.

J	MANGASARIAN, OL; STREET, WN; WOLBERG, WH				MANGASARIAN, OL; STREET, WN; WOLBERG, WH			BREAST-CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS VIA LINEAR-PROGRAMMING	OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							MODELS	Two medical applications of linear programming are described in this paper. Specifically, linear programming-based machine learning techniques are used to increase the accuracy and objectivity of breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The first application to breast cancer diagnosis utilizes characteristics of individual cells, obtained from a minimally invasive fine needle aspirate, to discriminate benign from malignant breast lumps. This allows an accurate diagnosis without the need for a surgical biopsy. The diagnostic system in current operation at University of Wisconsin Hospitals was trained on samples from 569 patients and has had 100% chronological correctness in diagnosing 131 subsequent patients. The second application, recently put into clinical practice, is a method that constructs a surface that predicts when breast cancer is likely to recur in patients that have had their cancers excised. This gives the physician and the patient better information with which to plan treatment, and may eliminate the need for a prognostic surgical procedure. The novel feature of the predictive approach is the ability to handle cases for which cancer has not recurred (censored data) as well as cases for which cancer has recurred at a specific time. The prognostic system has an expected error of 13.9 to 18.3 months, which is better than prognosis correctness by other available techniques.

While these techniques are plausible, theoretically well-founded, and perform well on more or less artificial test data sets, they depend on their ability to make sense of real-world data. This paper describes a project that is applying a range of machine learning strategies to problems in agriculture and horticulture. We briefly survey some of the techniques emerging from machine learning research, describe a software workbench for experimenting with a variety of techniques on real-world data sets, and describe a case study of dairy herd management in which culling rules were inferred from a medium-sized database of herd information.

J	BLUROCK, ES				BLUROCK, ES			AUTOMATIC LEARNING OF CHEMICAL CONCEPTS - RESEARCH OCTANE NUMBER AND MOLECULAR SUBSTRUCTURES	COMPUTERS & CHEMISTRY			English	Article								A set of 230 hydrocarbons is analyzed with respect to the research octane number (RON) using an extended version of the ID3 machine learning method of Quinlan. The basic ID3 method produces a decision tree. The questions within the decision tree ask whether given substructures are present or absent within a molecule (for example, is the hexane carbon skeleton present as a substructure?). The decision to be made is whether the RON value is within a given range (for example, is the RON greater than or equal to 90). In addition to the normal usage of decision trees to predict the RON value, qualitative information is extracted: for example, which substructures are significant in which RON ranges. The best results were found for those molecules having RON values between 90 and 105. This was due to the high density of samples in this region. The ID3 method is used to prune down an overabundance of parameters to a reasonable size. From the original set of 230 substructures, it was found that only 31 were needed for the RON description. The presence or absence of the substructures n-hexane, methylbenzene and benzene were particularly significant in determining the RON value. Considering that ID3 is not a traditional method of analysis, especially within chemistry, an effort is made to explain its principles using the problem at hand as an example. In addition, its use as the first step in analysis to gain intuitive information is explained.		BLUROCK, ES (reprint author), JOHANNES KEPLER UNIV,SYMBOL COMPUTAT RES INST,A-4020 LINZ,AUSTRIA.

The generalization was estimated by measuring the test errors and it was better with an ALN, especially if past points were used to reflect the time dimension, Both techniques were able to predict future stimulation events, An advantage of the ALN over the IL was that ALN's can be retrained with new data without losing previously collected knowledge, The advantages of the IL over the ALN were that the IL produces small, explicit, comprehensible trees and that the relative importance of each sensory contribution can be quantified.

We apply this model using the nearest-neighbor learning algorithm, and develop upper and lower bounds on sample complexity for several different concept classes. For some concept classes, the sample complexity turns out to be exponential even using this best-case model, which implies that the concept class is inherently difficult for the NN algorithm. We identify several geometric properties that make learning certain concepts relatively easy. Finally we discuss the relation of our work to helpful teacher models, its application to decision tree learning algorithms, and some of its implications for current experimental work.

Rules were induced from past customer account data to predict whether an account that is one month delinquent will be rectified or remain delinquent. Each of the rules has a reliability greater than that prescribed by management. The induced rules outperformed current scoring methods in predicting customer behavior on a holdout dataset. In addition, using the rules will result in matching current performance with 30% fewer contacts with delinquent customers.

The proposed integration paradigm exploits the synergy of the two approaches for both the training and the recognition phases of an image recognition system. In the training phase, a symbolic module provides an approximate solution to a given image-recognition problem in terms of symbolic models. Such models are hierarchically organized into different abstraction levels, and include contextual descriptions. After mapping such models into a complex neural architecture, a neural training process is carried out to optimize the solution of the recognition problem. The so-obtained neural networks are used during the recognition phase for pattern classification. In this phase, the role of symbolic modules consists of managing complex aspects of information processing: abstraction levels, contextual information, and global recognition hypotheses. A hybrid system implementing the proposed integration paradigm is presented, and its advantages over single approaches are assessed. Results on Magnetic Resonance image recognition are reported, and comparisons with some well-known classifiers are made.	UNIV GENOA,DEPT BIOPHYS & ELECTR ENGN,GENOA,ITALY							Baum E.

For comparative purposes, 114 patients with bleeding disorders were also studied. An unsupervised non-metric clustering technique was used in an attempt to classify bleeders against non-bleeders based solely on the responses to the questionnaire. Non-metric techniques are essential for the classification process because of the large number of missing attribute values in the patient data set. As a benchmark, a supervised inductive machine learning strategy was also used to classify the patients. Performance results are compared and contrasted between the techniques across different subsets of the patient data. These techniques are also evaluated as a methodology for determining the relative significance of attributes vis-a-vis the reduction of the dimensionality of a large medical data set. In this investigation, the classification rate achieved using the non-metric technique (73%) was only marginally poorer than the rate using the supervised technique (76%). Moreover, these results were obtained with an accompanying 80% reduction in the number of attributes used to perform the analysis.

In this paper, one kind of machine learning methodology-ID3 is used for the detection of tool failure. Based on the example objects which are known only through their values of a set of attributes, a decision tree which is the representation of acquired knowledge of ID3 can be constructed. The main objective of using ID3 is td learn more than one piece of information to detect the tool failure correctly, and also to acquire the implicit knowledge of tool failure phenomenon. Here, six attributes of two kinds of signals (AE signal and cutting force signal) in the single point turning operation are selected for constructing the decision tree. Experiments of using ID3 to detect the tool failure is executed, and the high correct rate in detection for the tool failure is received.

J	YANG, PF; MARAGOS, P				YANG, PF; MARAGOS, P			MIN-MAX CLASSIFIERS - LEARNABILITY, DESIGN AND APPLICATION	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						PATTERN CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE LEARNING; MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY; IMAGE PROCESSING; CHARACTER RECOGNITION		This paper introduces the class of min-max classifiers. These are binary-valued functions that can be used as pattern classifiers of both real-valued and binary-valued feature vectors. They are also lattice-theoretic generalization of Boolean functions and are also related to feed-forward neural networks and morphological signal operators. We studied supervised learning of these classifiers under the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model proposed by Valiant. Several subclasses of thresholded min-max functions are shown to be learnable, generalizing the learnability results for the corresponding classes of Boolean functions. We also propose a LMS algorithm for the practical training of these pattern classifiers. Experimental results using the LMS algorithm for handwritten character recognition are promising. For example, in our experiments the min-max classifiers were able to achieve error rates that are comparable or better than those generated using neural networks. The major advantage of min-max classifiers compared to neural networks is their simplicity and the faster convergence of their training algorithm.

J	ABDELAAL, RE; ELHADIDY, MA				ABDELAAL, RE; ELHADIDY, MA			MODELING AND FORECASTING THE DAILY MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE USING ABDUCTIVE MACHINE LEARNING	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article							MINIMUM TEMPERATURE	The abductory induction mechanism (AIM(R)) is a modern machine-learning modeling tool that draws from the fields of neural networks, abductive networks, and multiple regression analysis. This paper introduces AIM as a useful weather modeling and forecasting utility and reports on its use with daily maximum temperatures in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Compared with other statistical methods and neural network techniques, this approach has the advantages of faster and highly automated model synthesis as well as improved prediction and forecasting accuracies. AIM models developed using daily data for 18 weather parameters over 1 yr that were used to predict the maximum temperature on a given day from other parameters on the same day. Evaluated on data for another full year, these models give 97% yield in the +/- 3 degrees C error category. Various models for 3-day forecasting have been developed and evaluated. First-day forecasts give 77% yield in the same error category, and they compare favorably with official forecasts for the region, particularly for the warm seasons, as well as with forecasts based on persistence and climatology. Model relationships and performance statistics are compared with those previously obtained for the minimum temperature. The effect of increasing the AIM model complexity is investigated for both modeling and forecasting.

Design: An interactive computer system evaluates, diagnoses, and determines prognosis based on cytologic features derived from a digital scan of fine-needle aspirate slides. Setting: The University of Wisconsin (Madison) Departments of Computer Science and Surgery and the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics. Patients: Five hundred sixty-nine consecutive patients (212 with cancer and 357 with benign masses) provided the data for the diagnostic algorithm, and an additional 118 (31 with malignant masses and 87 with benign masses) consecutive, new patients tested the algorithm. One hundred ninety of these patients with invasive cancer and without distant metastases were used for prognosis. Interventions: Surgical biopsy specimens were taken from all cancers and some benign masses. The remaining cytologically benign masses were followed up for a year and surgical biopsy specimens were taken if they changed in size or character. Patients with cancer received standard treatment. Outcome Measures: Cross validation was used to project the accuracy of the diagnostic algorithm and to determine the importance of prognostic features. In addition, the mean errors were calculated between the actual times of distant disease occurrence and the times predicted using various prognostic features. Statistical analyses were also done. Results The predicted diagnostic accuracy was 97% and the actual diagnostic accuracy on 118 new samples was 100%. Tumor size and lymph node status were weak prognosticators compared with nuclear features, in particular those measuring nuclear size. Compared with the actual time for recurrence, the mean error of predicted times for recurrence with the nuclear features was 17.9 months and was 20.1 months with tumor size and lymph node status (P=.11). Conclusion: Computer technology will improve breast fine-needle aspirate accuracy and prognostic estimations.

Four machine learning methods were used: ID3, ID3 with dropping conditions, and two options of the system LERS (Learning from Examples based on Rough Sets): LEM1 and LEM2. Two knowledge acquisition options of LERS were used as well. All six methods were used for rule induction from six real-life data sets. The main objective was to test how an expert system, supplied with these rule sets, performs without information on a few attributes. Thus an expert system attempts to classify examples with all missing values of some attributes. As a result of experiments, it is clear that all machine learning methods performed much worse than knowledge acquisition options of LERS. Thus, machine learning methods used for knowledge acquisition should be replaced by other methods of rule induction that will generate complete sets of rules. Knowledge acquisition options of LERS are examples of such appropriate ways of inducing rules for building knowledge bases.

This procedure is most useful for evaluating alternative concept hierarchies for the same database. The DBLEARN knowledge discovery program uses an attribute-oriented inductive-inference method to discover potentially significant high-level relationships in a database. A concept forest, with at most one concept hierarchy for each attribute, defines the possible generalizations that DBLEARN can make for a database. The potential for discovery in a database is estimated by examining the complexity of the corresponding concept forest. Two heuristic measures are defined based on the number, depth, and height of the interior nodes. Higher values for these measures indicate more complex concept forests and arguably more potential for discovery. Experimental results using a variety of concept forests and four commercial databases show that in practice both measures permit quite reliable decisions to be made; thus, the simplest may be most appropriate.

Because of the huge amount of data stored in large numbers of existing databases, and because the amount of data generated in electronic forms is growing rapidly, it is necessary to develop efficient methods to extract knowledge from databases. An attribute-oriented rough set approach has been developed for knowledge discovery in databases. The method integrates machine-learning paradigm, especially learning-from-examples techniques, with rough set techniques. An attribute-oriented concept tree ascension technique is first applied in generalization, which substantially reduces the computational complexity of database learning processes. Then the cause-effect relationship among the attributes in the database is analyzed using rough set techniques, and the unimportant or irrelevant attributes are eliminated. Thus concise and strong rules with little or no redundant information can be learned efficiently. Our study shows that attribute-oriented induction combined with rough set theory provide an efficient and effective mechanism for knowledge discovery in database systems.

Many applications require that the classification rules be derived from data representing exemplar occurrences of data patterns belonging to different classes. The problem of identifying such rules in data has been researched within the field of machine learning, and more recently in the context of rough set theory and knowledge discovery in databases. In this paper we present an incremental methodology for finding all maximally generalized rules and for adaptive modification of them when new data become available. The methodology is developed in the context of rough set theory and is based on the earlier idea of discernibility matrix introduced by Skowron.

Several methods of inductive learning, such as ID3 family and AQ family, have been applied to discover meaningful knowledge from large databases and their usefulness is assured in several aspects. However, since their methods are of a deterministic nature and the reliability of acquired knowledge is not evaluated statistically, these methods are ineffective when applied to domains essentially probabilistic in nature, such as medical domains. Extending concepts of rough set theory to a probabilistic domain, we introduce a new approach to knowledge acquisition, which induces probabilistic rules based on rough set theory (PRIMEROSE) and develop a program that extracts rules for an expert system from a clinical database, using this method. The results show that the derived rules almost correspond to those of the medical experts.

OFFLINE SYSTEM-DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION	IEE PROCEEDINGS-CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ADAPTIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS; BIOMEDICAL CONTROL; EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION; FUZZY LOGIC CONTROL; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; MACHINE LEARNING		Although fuzzy logic controllers and expert systems have been successfully applied in many complex industrial processes, they experience a deficiency in knowledge acquisition and rely to a great extent on empirical and heuristic knowledge which, in many cases, cannot be objectively elicited. Among the problems to be resolved in fuzzy controller design are the determination of the linguistic state space, definition of the membership functions of each linguistic term and the derivation of the control rules. Some of these problems can be solved by application of machine learning. First, it is desirable to simplify and automate the specification of linguistic rules. Secondly, it is also desirable that modification of control rules is possible in order to cope with previously unknown or changes in process dynamics. Machine learning methods have, in recent years, emerged from the use of learning algorithms modelled on natural and biological systems. These methods attempt to abstract the advanced mechanisms of learning exhibited by such systems, which can, consequently, be applied to intelligent control. One of these new algorithms is the genetic algorithm which is modelled on the processes of natural evolution. The paper develops the application of genetic algorithm techniques for fuzzy controller design.
