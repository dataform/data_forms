Compared with the traditional attribute-value learning methods, it has some advantages (the stronger expressive power and the ease of using background knowledge), but also some weak points. One particular issue is that the theory, techniques and experiences are much less mature for ILP to deal with imperfect data than in the traditional attribute-value learning methods. This paper applies the Rough Set theory to ILP to deal with imperfect data, which occur in large real-world applications. We investigate various kinds of imperfect data in ILP and identify a subset of them to tackle. Namely, we concentrate on incomplete background knowledge (where essential predicates/clauses are missing) and on indiscernible data (where some examples belong to both sets of positive and negative training examples), proposing rough problem settings for these cases. The rough settings relax the strict requirements in the standard normal problem setting for ILP, so that rough but useful hypotheses can be induced from imperfect data.

To cope with this problem, many methods for selecting a subset of features with similar-enough behaviors to merit focused analysis have been proposed. In such methods, the filter approach that selects a feature subset using a preprocessing step, and the wrapper approach that selects an optimal feature subset from the space of possible subsets of features using the induction algorithm itself as a part of the evaluation function, are two typical ones. Although the filter approach is a faster one, it has some blindness and the performance of induction is not considered. On the other hand, the optimal feature subsets can be obtained by using the wrapper approach, but it is not easy to use because the complexity of time and space. In this paper, we propose an algorithm of using the rough set methodology with greedy heuristics for feature selection. In our approach, selecting features is similar as the filter approach, but the performance of induction is considered in the evaluation criterion for feature selection. That is, we select the features that damage the performance of induction as little as possible.

From the experimental results, a set of formula-behavior rules are generated which show relationships between a formula's performance and dataset characteristics. These formula-behavior rules are combined into formula-selection rules which can be used in a rule induction system to select a rule quality formula before rule induction.

J	Anthony, S; Frisch, AM				Anthony, S; Frisch, AM			Cautious induction: An alternative to clause-at-a-time hypothesis construction in inductive logic programming	NEW GENERATION COMPUTING			English	Article						machine learning; inductive learning; inductive logic programming; cautious induction		Hypotheses constructed by inductive logic programming (ILP) systems are finite sets of definite clauses. Top-down ILP systems usually adopt the following greedy clause-at-a-time strategy to construct such a hypothesis: start with the empty set of clauses and repeatedly add the clause that most improves the quality of the set. This paper formulates and analyses an alternative method for constructing hypotheses. The method, called cautious induction, consists of a first stage, which finds a finite set of candidate clauses, and a second stage, which selects a finite subset of these clauses to form a hypothesis. By using a less greedy method in the second stage, cautious induction can find hypotheses of higher quality than can be found with a clause-at-a-time algorithm. We have implemented a top-down, cautious ILP system called CILS. This paper presents CILS and compares it to Progol, a top-down clause-at-a-time ILP system. The sizes of the search spaces confronted by the two systems are analysed and an experiment examines their performance on a series of mutagenesis learning problems.

Distributions of four grammatical features are sufficient to reduce error rate by 50% over chance. We conclude that corpus data is a usable repository of verb class information, and that corpus-driven extraction of grammatical features is a promising methodolcgy for automatic lexical acquisition.

This task is referred to as ordinal regression and is complementary to the standard machine learning tasks of classification and metric regression. In contrast to statistical models we present a distribution independent formulation of the problem together with uniform bounds of the risk functional. The approach presented is based on a mapping from objects to scalar utility values. Similar to Support Vector methods we derive a new learning algorithm for the task of ordinal regression based on large margin rank boundaries. We give experimental results for an information retrieval task: learning the order of documents w.r.t. an initial query. Experimental results indicate that the presented algorithm outperforms more naive approaches to ordinal regression such as Support Vector classification and Support Vector regression in the case of more than two ranks.

More precisely, we consider the modeling of text sequences with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and show how these models can be used to perform specific surface extraction tasks (i.e. tasks which do not need in depth syntactic or semantic analysis). We consider different text representations using semantic and syntactic knowledge and analyze the influence of different grammatical constraints on the models using the MUC-6 corpus.

The input of the system is a sequence of images, each of which shows an unknown number of overlapping unknown 2D objects. The system identifies matching partial shapes across different images and combines them into complete 2D shape models, thus giving a complete interpretation of the input scenes. The identification of partial shapes is based on string matching, whereas a graph search procedure is used for shape model generation. The system has been fully implemented and tested on images containing parts of a jigsaw puzzle.

In this paper we consider two applications of decision tree learning in the domain of river water quality: a) the simultaneous prediction of multiple physico-chemical properties of the water from its biological properties using a single decision tree (as opposed to learning a different tree for each different property) and b) the prediction of past physico-chemical properties of the river water from its current biological properties. We discuss some experimental results that we believe are interesting both to the application domain experts and to the machine learning community.

The aim of meta-level learning is to relate the performance of different machine learning algorithms to the characteristics of the dataset. The relation is induced on the basis of empirical data about the performance of machine learning algorithms on the different datasets. In the paper, an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) framework for meta-level learning is presented. The performance of three machine learning algorithms (the tree learning system C4.5, the rule learning system CN2 and the k-NN nearest neighbour classifier) were measured on twenty datasets from the UCI repository in order to obtain the dataset for meta-learning. The results of applying ILP on this meta-learning problem are presented and discussed.

The general framework contains a combined top-down and bottom-up strategy to tackle this problem. In the current paper we describe the Algorithm Selection Tool (AST) that is one component in our frame-work. AST is designed to support algorithm selection in the knowledge discovery process with a case-based reasoning approach. We discuss the architecture of AST and explain the basic components. We present the evaluation of our approach in a systematic analysis of the case retrieval behaviour and thus of the selection support offered by our system.

In RFP training is based on simply storing the projections of the training instances on each feature separately. Prediction of the target. value for a query point is obtained through two approximation procedures. executed sequentially. The first approximation process is to find the individual predictions of features by using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN). The second approximation process combines the predictions of all features. During the first approximation step, each feature is associated with a weight in order to determine the prediction ability of the feature at the local query point. The weights, found for each local query point, are used in the second step and enforce the method to have an adaptive or context-sensitive nature. We have compared RFP with the KNN algorithm. Results on real data sets show that RFP is much faster than KNN, yet its prediction accuracy is comparable with the KNN algorithm.

The regression tree model explained 39.7% of the variation in the data, while the Bayesian network model explained 69.1% of the variation. Both models predicted similar spatial trends in yield, and both models predicted yield to within +/-0.25 t ha(-1) of measured yield >50% of the area of the field. In comparing model types, both models suffered from an inability to predict yields <0.33 t ha(-1) or yields >1.89 t ha(-1). We suggest that Bayesian network models are more suitable frameworks for site specific management research than regression trees, or other machine learning methods similar to regression trees.

The assignment presented students with an introduction to machine learning research. The assignment required students to apply Genetic Programming to evolve algorithms that play the board game Othello. The students were provided with an implemented experimental approach as a starting point. The students were required to perform their own experimental modifications corresponding to research issues in machine learning. The results of student experiments were good both in terms of research and in terms of student learning.

A variety of techniques from statistics, machine learning, and neural networks have been applied to databases in the hopes of mining knowledge from data. Multiple regression is one such method for modeling the relationship between a set of explanatory variables and a dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Here, we investigate and discuss some factors that influence whether the resulting regression equation is a credible model of the data.

This paper presents three anomaly detection techniques far profiling program behavior that evolve from memorization to generalization. The goal of monitoring program behavior is to be able to detect potential intrusions by noting irregularities in program behavior. The techniques start from a simple equality matching algorithm for determining anomalous behavior, and evolve to a feed-for ward backpropagation neural network: for learning program behavior, and finally to an Elman network for recognizing recurrent features in program execution traces. In order to detect future attacks against systems, intrusion detection systems must be able to generalize from past observed behavior. The goal of this research is to employ machine learning techniques that can generalize from past observed behavior to the problem of intrusion detection. The performance of these systems is compared by testing them with data provided by the DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation program.

J	Nielsen, H; Brunak, S; von Heijne, G				Nielsen, H; Brunak, S; von Heijne, G			Machine learning approaches for the prediction of signal peptides and other protein sorting signals	PROTEIN ENGINEERING			English	Review							SEQUENCE CLEAVAGE SITES; AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; NEURAL NETWORK; HYDROPHOBICITY; RECOGNITION; ACCURACY; PATTERN	Prediction of protein sorting signals from the sequence of amino acids has great importance in the field of proteomics today, Recently, the growth of protein databases, combined with machine learning approaches, such as neural networks and hidden Markov models, have made it possible to achieve a level of reliability where practical use in, for example automatic database annotation is feasible. In this review we concentrate on the present status and future perspectives of SignalP, our neural network-based method for prediction of the most well-known sorting signal: the secretory signal peptide. We discuss the problems associated with the use of SignalP on genomic sequences, showing that signal peptide prediction will improve further if integrated with predictions of start codons and transmembrane helices, As a step towards this goal, a hidden Markov model version of SignalP has been developed, making it possible to discriminate between cleaved signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors. Furthermore, we show how SignalP can be used to characterize putative signal peptides from an archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii, Finally, we briefly review a few methods for predicting other protein sorting signals and discuss the future of protein sorting prediction in general.

Exactly because of the high level of complexity and a lack of reliable strategic guidelines, the pervasive attitude has been that the problem can most successfully be attacked by human expertise, possibly assisted by some level of machine learning. This Led, in RoboCup'97, to a field of simulator teams all of whose level and style of play were heavily influenced by the human designers of those teams. In contrast, our 1998 team was "designed" entirely by the process of genetic programming. Our evolved team placed in the middle of the pack at Robocup98, despite the fact that it was largely machine learned rather than hand coded. This paper presents our motivation, our approach, and the specific construction of our team that created itself from scratch.

In this paper, we describe our work using Sony's legged robots to participate in the RoboCup'98 legged robot demonstration and competition. The robots are fully autonomous with on-board vision, control, and navigation. The challenges we addressed in this framework include the color calibration of the vision hardware, the landmark-based robot localization on the playing field, and the development of robot behaviors for the actual play of the game. The paper presents our approach and contributions to these issues. We apply machine learning techniques for automated color calibration and we develop effective vision-servoed navigation. We present our Bayesian localization algorithm. Team strategy is achieved through pre-defined behaviors. Our team of the Sony legged robots, CMTrio-98, won all of its games in the RoboCup-98 competition, and was awarded the first place in the championship.

J	Abdel-Aal, RE; Raashid, M				Abdel-Aal, RE; Raashid, M			Using abductive machine learning for online vibration monitoring of turbo molecular pumps	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						vibration monitoring and diagnostics; statistical vibration analysis; turbo molecular pumps; machine learning; abductive networks	NEURAL NETWORKS; SYSTEM	Turbo molecular vacuum pumps constitute a critical component in many accelerator installations, where failures can be costly in terms of both money and lost beam time. Catastrophic failures can be averted if prior warning is given through a continuous online monitoring scheme. This paper describes the use of modem machine learning techniques for online monitoring of the pump condition through the measurement and analysis of pump vibrations. Abductive machine learning is used for modeling the pump status as 'good' or 'bad' using both radial and axial vibration signals measured close to the pump bearing. Compared to other statistical methods and neural network techniques, this approach offers faster and highly automated model synthesis, requiring little or no user intervention. Normalized 50-channel spectra derived from the low frequency region (0-10 kHz) of the pump vibration spectra provided data inputs for model development. Models derived by training on only 10 observations predict the correct value of the logical pump status output with 100% accuracy for an evaluation population as large as 500 cases. Radial vibration signals lead to simpler models and smaller errors in the computed value of the status output. Performance is comparable with literature data on a similar diagnosis scheme for compressor valves using neural networks.

Our approach defines semantics at two levels: (1) primitive semantics at the patch level, extracted automatically from pixel characteristics of patches with supervised learning; and (2) scene semantics at the image level, recognized from the association of primitive semantics of the patches in a self-organizing manner. Images are classified and retrieved according to the similarity in scene semantics. Our experiments so far have yielded highly accurate scene classification results and very promising retrieval performance on a set of diverse natural scene images.

This representational power combined with generality makes genetic programming an interesting tool for automatic programming and machine learning. One weakness is the enormous time required for evolving complex programs. In this paper we present a method for accelerating evolution speed of genetic programming by active selection of fitness cases during the run. In contrast to conventional genetic programming in which all the given training data are used repeatedly, the presented method evolves programs using only a subset of given data chosen incrementally at each generation. This method is applied to the evolution of collective behaviors for multiple robotic agents. Experimental evidence supports that evolving programs on an incrementally selected subset of fitness cases can significantly reduce the fitness evaluation time without sacrificing generalization accuracy of the evolved programs.

There have been much work on the relationship of number of players and cooperation, evolutionary strategy learning as a kind of machine learning, and the effect of payoff function to cooperation. This paper attempts to reveal that cooperative coalition size depends on payoff function and localization affects the evolution of cooperation in the N-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (NIPD). Localization makes individuals to interact of learn with adjacent individuals. Experimental result reports that cooperative coalition size increases as the gradient of the payoff function for cooperation becomes steeper than that of defector's payoff function or as minimum coalition size gets smaller. It is also shown that localization of interaction is an important factor to affect cooperative coalition.

Systems for this task require significant domain-specific knowledge and are time-consuming and difficult to build by hand, making them a good application for machine learning. We present a system RAPIER, that uses pairs of sample documents and filled templates to induce pattern-match rules that directly extract fillers for the slots in the template. RAPIER employs a bottom-up learning algorithm which incorporates techniques from several inductive Logic programming systems and acquires unbounded patterns that include constraints on the words, part-of-speech tags, and semantic classes present in the filler and the surrounding text. We present encouraging experimental results on two domains.

In this paper, we introduce a new method for detecting feature interactions by evaluating the accuracies of a learning algorithm on random subsets of features. We give an operational definition for feature interactions based on when a set of features allows a learning algorithm to achieve higher than expected accuracy, assuming independence. Then we show how to adjust the sampling of random subsets in a way that is fair and balanced, given a limited amount of dime. Finally, we show how decision trees built from sets of interacting features can be converted into DNF expressions to form constructed features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method empirically by showing that it can improve the accuracy of the C4.5 decision-tree algorithm on several benchmark databases.

We are developing a multidocument summarization system to automatically generate a concise summary by identifying and synthesizing similarities across a set of related documents. Our approach is unique in its integration of machine learning and statistical techniques to identify similar paragraphs, intersection of similar phrases within paragraphs, and language generation to reformulate the wording of the summary. Our evaluation of system components shows that learning over multiple extracted linguistic features is more effective than information retrieval approaches at identifying similar text units for summarization and that it is possible to generate a fluent summary that conveys similarities among documents even when full semantic interpretations of the input text are not available.

The Multi-Rover Integrated Science Understanding System combines concepts from machine learning with planning and scheduling to perform autonomous scientific exploration by cooperating revers. The integrated system utilizes a novel machine learning clustering component to analyze science data and direct new science activities.

In our system, "expert modules" specialize in solving specific types of clues, drawing on ideas from information retrieval, database search, and machine learning. Each expert module generates a (possibly empty) candidate list for each clue, and the lists are merged together and placed into the grid by a centralized solver. We used a probabilistic representation throughout the system as a common interchange language between subsystems and to drive the search for an optimal solution. PROVERB, the complete system, averages 95.3% words correct and 98.1% letters correct in under 15 minutes per puzzle on a sample of 370 puzzles taken from the New York Times and several other puzzle sources. This corresponds to missing roughly 3 words Or 4 letters on a daily 15 x 15 puzzle, making PROVERB a better-than-average cruciverbalist (crossword server).

Given a query image, the goal of a CBIR system is to search the database and return the n most visually similar images to the query image. Ln this paper, we describe an approach to CBIR, for medical databases that relies on human input, machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, we apply expert-level human interaction for serving that aspect of the problem which cannot yet be automated, are use computer Vision for only those aspects of the problem to which it lends itself best - image characterization - and we employ machine learning algorithms to allow the system to be adapted to new clinical domains. We present empirical results for the domain of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lung. Our results illustrate the efficacy of a human-in-the-loop approach to image characterization and the ability of our approach to adapt the retrieval process to a particular clinical domain through the application of machine learning algorithms.

Based on feedback from the user, the system automatically adapts to the user's preferences and interests. In this paper we focus on the system's user modeling component. First, we motivate the use of a multi-strategy machine learning approach that allows for the induction of user models that consist of separate models for long-term and short-term interests, Second, we investigate the utility of explicitly modeling information that the system has already presented to the user. This allows us to address an important issue that has thus far received virtually no attention in the Information Retrieval community: the fact that a user's information need changes as a direct result of interaction with information. We evaluate the proposed algorithms on user data collected with a prototype of our system, and assess the individual performance contributions of both model components.

Results are presented on the predictive power of the models, and the extent to which they were tailored to each controller. The behaviour of the participants in the study and the behaviour of an interpreter executing their models are compared with respect to the amount of time they were able to keep the pole and cart under control, the degree of stability achieved, and the conditions of failure. We discuss the results of the study, the limitations of the methodology in relation to learner modelling, and we point out future directions of research.

Stereotypes are built using supervised learning (C4.5) on personal data extracted from a set of questionnaires answered by the users of a news filtering system. Particular emphasis is given to the characteristic features of the task of learning stereotypes and, in this context, the new notion of community stereotype is introduced. On the other hand, the communities are built using unsupervised learning (COBWEB) on data containing users' interests on the news categories covered by the news filtering system. Our main concern is whether meaningful communities can be constructed and for this purpose we specify a metric to decide on the representative news categories for each community. The encouraging results presented in this paper, suggest that established machine learning methods can be particularly useful for the acquisition of stereotypes and communities.

In recent years, however, the application of machine teaming techniques to control user-adapted interaction has become popular. In this paper, we present and compare adaptive systems that use either knowledge representation or machine learning for user modeling. Based on this comparison, several dimensions are identified that can be used to distinguish both approaches, but also to characterize user modeling systems in general. The LaboUr (Learning about the User) approach to user modeling is presented which attempts to take an ideal position in the resulting multi-dimensional space by combining machine learning and knowledge representation techniques. Finally, an implementation of LaboUr ideas into the information server ELFI is sketched.

We review some previous work in this emerging area, ranging from software that filters information to systems that support more complex tasks like scheduling. After this, we describe three ongoing research efforts that extend this framework in new directions. Finally, we review previous work that has addressed similar issues and consider some challenges that are presented by the design of adaptive user interfaces.

Experimental results show the obtained classifiers, learned using the CI based algorithms, are competitive with (or superior to) the best known classifiers, based on both Bayesian networks and other formalisms; and that the computational time for learning and using these classifiers is relatively small. Moreover, these results also suggest a way to learn yet more effective classifiers; we demonstrate empirically that this new algorithm does work as expected. Collectively, these results argue that BN classifiers deserve more attention in machine learning and data mining communities.

The first technique is an algorithm that efficiently extracts one-way and two-way counts-either real or expected-from discrete data. Extracting such counts is a fundamental step in learning algorithms for constructing a variety of models including decision trees, decision graphs, Bayesian networks, and naive-Bayes clustering models. The second technique is an algorithm that efficiently performs the E-step of the EM algorithm (i.e., inference) when applied to a naive-Bayes clustering model. Using real-world data sets, we demonstrate a dramatic decrease in running time for algorithms that incorporate these techniques.

Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM. Our approach yields substantial and consistent improvements over Latent Semantic Analysis in a number of experiments.

English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on New Trends in Cognitive Science (NTCS 97)	MAY 14-16, 1997	VIENNA, AUSTRIA	Austrian Soc Cognit Sci				External representation is the use of the physical world for cognitive ends, the enlargement of the mechanisms of representation to include the action-perception cycle. It has recently been observed that such representation is pervasive in human activity in both pragmatic and more abstract tasks. It is argued here that by forcing an artificial learning system to off-load all of its representation onto a (simulated) external world, we may obtain a model that is biased in a very natural way to represent functional relations in ways similar to those used by people. After learning a function from examples, such a model should therefore generalize to unseen instances in ways that we would consider correct. These ideas are tested by developing two machine learning systems, in which representation relies on the sensorimotor control of simulated robotic agents. These systems are able to represent a variety of functional relations by means of their action and perception, and they learn to spontaneously do so from examples. Moreover, they generalize extremely well to unseen problems even after a small number of examples, including on functions such as n-parity that are notoriously difficult to generalize for machine learning algorithms. It is argued that despite these systems' simplicity, the external representations that they evolve are similar to those used by people on similar tasks.

Because the state of traffic and road are complex, so the control of ALV is complex and uncertain. Especially if the ALV runs in normal state of traffic, the control of ALV is becoming more complex and difficult. A good idea is that to let the control system of ALV to simulate human driver and develop a machine-leaning system in the control system of ALV. So that as the control system of ALV is driving ALV along road, the control system can learn from the experience of human driver according to the state of traffic and road. In other words, the control system of ALV is able to become more and more "clever". Of course it is a challenging and very difficult task. This paper analyses the principle of machine-leaning system used for ALV and discusses the engineering method of developing a machine-leaning system used for ALV, when the ALV runs along highway in normal traffic. This paper advances the administrative levels of machine-leaning system and a method of fusing human intelligence into machine intelligence. This paper introduces our preliminary research on machine-leaning system used for ALV also, which is a kind of online machine-leaning system without teacher.

The method uses a learned fuzzy representation of pixel region characteristics, based upon the conjunction and disjunction of extracted and derived fuzzy color and texture features. Both positive and negative exemplars of some visually apparent characteristic which forms the basis of the inspection, input by a human operator, are used together with a clustering algorithm to construct positive similarity membership functions (PMF) and negative similarity membership functions (NSMFs). Using these, composite fuzzified images, P and N, are produced using fuzzy union. Classification is accomplished via image defuzzification, whereby linguistic meaning is assigned to each pixel in the fuzzy set using a fuzzy inference operation. The technique permits: (1) strict color and texture discrimination, (2) machine learning of color and texture characteristics of regions, (3) and judicious labeling of each pixel based upon leaned fuzzy representations and fuzzy classification. This approach appears ideal for applications involving visual inspection and allows the development of image-based inspection systems which may be trained and used by relatively unskilled workers. We show three different examples involving the visual inspection of mixed waste drums, lumber and woven fabric.

In this paper, we show recent research results in the development and use of meta-algorithms, i.e., algorithms which lead to new algorithms. Although the concept is generally applicable, the application domain in this work is restricted to image processing. The meta-algorithm concept described in this paper is based upon our work in dynamic algorithms[4]. The paper first presents the concept of dynamic algorithms which, on the basis of training and archived algorithmic experience embedded in an an algorithm graph (AG), dynamically adjust the sequence of operations applied to the input image data. Each node in the tree-based representation of a dynamic algorithm with out degree greater than 2 is a decision node. At these nodes, the algorithm examines the input data and determines which path will most likely achieve the desired result. This is currently done using nearest-neighbor classification. The details of this implementation are shown. The constrained perturbation of existing algorithm graphs, coupled with a suitable search strategy, is one mechanism to achieve meta-algorithms and offers rich potential for the discovery of new algorithms. In our work, a meta-algorithm autonomously generates new dynamic algorithm graphs via genetic recombination of existing algorithm graphs. The AG representation is well suited to this genetic-like perturbation, using a commonly-employed technique in artificial neural network synthesis[5], namely the blueprint representation for graphs [6). A number of exam One of the principal limitations of our current approach is the need for significant human input in the learning phase. Efforts to overcome this limitation are discussed. Future research directions are indicated.	Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA	Schalkoff, RJ (reprint author), Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.						Koza J., 1994, GENETIC PROGRAMMING; Koza J.

This approach extends the previously proposed TREPAN method in two ways: it uses fuzzy representation in its knowledge-extraction process (by means of Fuzzy Decision Trees), and it uses additional heuristics in its process of generating artificial data. The paper describes the proposed approach in detail, and it presents its empirical evaluation on popular machine learning benchmarks.

This theory makes operational the famous theory of partitions and set systems of Hartmanis. The information relationships and measures enable us to analyze relationships between the modeled information streams and constitute an important analysis apparatus that can be used for analysis and synthesis of various information systems. If can be applied in logic design, pattern analysis, machine learning, and other fields. This paper shows how to apply the relationships and measures to logic design when using as examples three important problems: input support minimization, parallel decomposition and serial functional decomposition. The application examples and experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate the high potential of the information relationships and measures in solving logic synthesis problems.

B	Stankovski, V		Antypas, G		Stankovski, V			The use of artificial intelligence in interpretation of clinical trials	2ND BALKAN CONGRESS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Congress of the Balkan-Union-of-Oncology	SEP 10-14, 1998	IZMIR, TURKEY	Balkan Union Oncol				The aim of clinical trials is to produce scientifically valid results thus, helping doctors understand a treatment's benefits and drawbacks. They can be used not only to understand new treatments, but also to determine new ways of using existing treatments. Currently, only statistical methods are being used in the process of understanding clinical trials and other medical problems in general. The purpose of this paper is to show how state-of-the-art methods of artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular, can also be used for data analysis and interpretation. The later approach can be especially suitable in the case of clinical trials. This new methodology is a qualitative extension of the methodology that uses only statistical methods and its use is therefore, recommended in any clinical study. In this lecture, the artificial intelligence approach is worked through an example.

Here we describe a method for learning general, page-independent heuristics for extracting data from HTML documents. The input to our learning system is a set of working wrapper programs, paired with HTML pages they correctly wrap. The output is a general procedure for extracting data that works for many formats and many pages. In experiments with a collection of 84 constrained but realistic extraction problems, we demonstrate that 30% of the problems can be handled perfectly by learned extraction heuristics, and around 50% can be handled acceptably. We also demonstrate that learned page-independent extraction heuristics can substantially improve the performance of methods for learning page-specific wrappers.

Whether the application is a nation to nation conflict or a hacker versus a security firewall, machine learning through genetic evolution provides a stable intelligent agent environment. Pre-disposition factors maintain the goal structure of the inference engine as the conflict escalates and decision support within the model becomes critical. The design methodology of this new approach to the development of an IA and an example application scenario are both presented in this paper.

To realize this system, the technology that acquires customer's taste and changes customers request into the physical parameter for the product design is needed. Although some methods for such system have been proposed, the methods that consider customer's individuality and further handle 3D shape are few. Because of this point, we propose a method of KANSEI acquisition to 3D shape. ne method is based on 3D shape deformation and machine learning techniques, and can model the relationship between 3D shape and KANSEI about them. Sofa was chosen as an example of design and an experiment for testing the method was made, and then some problems were made clear.

J	Amaldi, E; Kann, V				Amaldi, E; Kann, V			On the approximability of minimizing nonzero variables or unsatisfied relations in linear systems	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						linear systems; unsatisfied relations; nonzero variables; approximability bounds; designing linear classifiers	APPROXIMATION CLASSES; MINIMIZATION; COMPLEXITY; HARDNESS	We investigate the computational complexity of two closely related classes of combinatorial optimization problems for linear systems which arise in various fields such as machine learning, operations research and pattern recognition. In the first class (MIN ULR) one wishes, given a possibly infeasible system of linear relations, to find a solution that violates as few relations as possible while satisfying all the others. In the second class (MIN RVLS) the linear system is supposed to be feasible and one looks for a solution with as few nonzero variables as possible. For both MIN ULR and MIN RVLS the four basic types of relational operators =, greater than or equal to, > and not equal are considered. While MIN RVLS with equations was mentioned to be NP-hard in (Garey and Johnson, 1979), we established in (Amaldi; 1992; Amaldi and Kann, 1995) that MIN ULR with equalities and inequalities are NP-hard even when restricted to homogeneous systems with bipolar coefficients. The latter problems have been shown hard to approximate in (Arora et al., 1993). In this paper we determine strong bounds on the approximability of various variants of MIN RVLS and MIN ULR, including constrained ones where the variables are restricted to take binary values or where some relations are mandatory while others are optional. The various NP-hard versions turn out to have different approximability properties depending on the type of relations and the additional constraints, but none of them can be approximated within any constant factor, unless P = NP. Particular attention is devoted to two interesting special cases that occur in discriminant analysis and machine learning. In particular, we disprove a conjecture of van Horn and Martinet (1992) regarding the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm to design linear classifiers (or perceptrons) that involve a close-to-minimum number of features.

J	Caelli, T; Osman, E; West, G				Caelli, T; Osman, E; West, G			3D shape matching and inspection using geometric features and relational learning	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article							RECOGNITION; OBJECTS	In this paper we consider the problem of matching 3D sensed data with models and inspection for defects where the correspondence between models and data needs to be solved in robust and efficient ways. We explore the use of machine learning (in particular, relational learning) as an efficient method for solving correspondence (and so, pose estimation) as well as automatically generating rules for acceptable shape variations from training data. As an additional but necessary issue, we also consider the use of view-independent covariance methods for the extraction of surface features used to determine shape signatures which correspond to curvature-like surface attributes. Such features are utilized in the relational learning model. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

J	Murthy, SK				Murthy, SK			Automatic construction of decision trees from data: A multi-disciplinary survey	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Review						classification; tree-structured classifiers; data compaction	HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFIER DESIGN; MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS; DIGITIZED POSS-II; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; FEATURE-SELECTION; NONPARAMETRIC CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION TREES; NEURAL NETWORKS; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; THEORETIC APPROACH	Decision trees have proved to be valuable tools for the description, classification and generalization of data. Work on constructing decision trees from data exists in multiple disciplines such as statistics, pattern recognition, decision theory, signal processing, machine learning and artificial neural networks. Researchers in these disciplines, sometimes working on quite different problems, identified similar issues and heuristics for decision tree construction. This paper surveys existing work on decision tree construction, attempting to identify the important issues involved, directions the work has taken and the current state of the art.

Also, pseudorandom sets for rectangles have been actively studied recently because (i) they are a subproblem common to the derandomization of depth-2 (DNF) circuits and derandomizing randomized logspace, and (ii) they approximate the distribution of n independent multivalued random variables.

J	McLean, D; Bandar, Z; O'Shea, JD				McLean, D; Bandar, Z; O'Shea, JD			An empirical comparison of back propagation and the RDSE algorithm on continuously valued real world data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						neural network; feed forward; steepness parameter; generalisation; interpolation; neuronal model; algorithm; entropy	NEURAL NETWORKS; GAIN	The ability of a neural network to generalise is dependent on how representative the training patterns were of the whole data domain, and how smoothly the network has fitted to these patterns [Sethi, I.K. (1990). IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Seattle, WA, Vol. 2, pp. 219-224]. In non-scaled continuous data domains, training examples will lie at differing distances from each other, making the fitting problem more difficult and varied. This paper introduces a new neuron with an adaptive steepness parameter, implemented as an extra internal connection, which is altered to better interpolate between the data points that its hyperplane divides. Networks of the new neuronal model are trained using a new paradigm entitled the random directed search by entropy algorithm (RDSE). This involves constructing a network by training one neuron at a time and freezing the weights. Each neuron is trained using directed random search [Baba (1989). Neural Networks, 2, 367-373] to find a hyperplane that separates examples by minimising an entropy measure [Quinlan (1986). Induction of Decision Trees, Machine Learning, Vol.. 1, pp. 81-106]. This training paradigm solves the problem of pre-defining a network topology, has few problems with local minima, can handle unsealed continuous input data and can be fully trained in a relatively short time scale when compared with other methods, e.g. back propagation (BP). An example benchmark problem is used to illustrate the effects of the new neuronal model, and results for two real world data domains are given which display an improved classification rate when compared against networks with a constant steepness value for every neuron. An empirical comparison between BP and RDSE for the two data sets are also given. These results display improved training times, robustness and classification rates by RDSE when compared against BP.

In this study, datasets were solicited from agricultural researchers and processed using a machine learning workbench. The results were reported to the researchers, and then interviews were conducted with some of them to determine their perceptions about the use of machine learning as an additional analysis technique to traditional statistical analysis. A number of themes about their satisfaction with this technique were constructed from the interview transcripts, which generally indicate that machine learning may be able to contribute to analysis and understanding of these kinds of datasets.

J	Mamitsuka, H				Mamitsuka, H			Predicting peptides that bind to MHC molecules using supervised learning of hidden Markov models	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND GENETICS			English	Article						major histocompatibility complex; antigen; stochastic models; machine learning; protein docking; computational biology; immunology	CLASS-I MOLECULES; SECONDARY ANCHOR RESIDUES; T-CELL EPITOPES; 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE; PROTEIN SEQUENCES; MOTIFS; RECOGNITION; SITES	The binding of a major histocompatibility complex (MRC) molecule to a peptide originating in an antigen is essential to recognizing :antigens in immune systems, and it has proved to be important to use computers to predict the peptides that will bind to an MHC molecule. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we propose to apply supervised learning of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to this problem,which can surpass existing methods for the problem of predicting MHC-binding peptides, Second, we generate peptides that have high probabilities to bind to a certain MRC molecule, based on our proposed method using peptides binding to MHC molecules as a set of training data. From our experiments, in a type of cross-validation test, the discrimination accuracy of our supervised learning method is usually approximately 2-15% better than those of other methods, including backpropagation neural networks, which have been regarded as the most effective approach to this problem. Furthermore, using an HMM trained for HLA-A2, we present new peptide sequences that are provided with high binding probabilities by the HMM and that are thus expected to bind to HLA-A2 proteins. Peptide sequences not shown in this Paper but with rather high binding probabilities-can be obtained from the author (E-mail: mami@ccm.cl.nec.co.jp). (C) 1998 Wiley Liss, Inc.

J	Krishnan, P; Vitter, JS				Krishnan, P; Vitter, JS			Optimal prediction for prefetching in the worst case	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						caching; prefetching; competitive analysis; finite state prefetchers; response time; fault rate; hypertext; operating systems; databases; prediction; machine learning	INDIVIDUAL SEQUENCES; COMPRESSION	Response time delays caused by I/O are a major problem in many systems and database applications. Prefetching and cache replacement methods are attracting renewed attention because of their success in avoiding costly I/Os. Prefetching can be looked upon as a type of online sequential prediction, where the predictions must be accurate as well as made in a computationally efficient way. Unlike other online problems, prefetching cannot admit a competitive analysis, since the optimal offline prefetcher incurs no cost when it knows the future page requests. Previous analytical work on prefetching [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 143 (1996), pp. 771-793] consisted of modeling the user as a probabilistic Markov source. In this paper, we look at the much stronger form of worst-case analysis and derive a randomized algorithm for pure prefetching. We compare our algorithm for every page request sequence with the important class of finite state prefetchers, making no assumptions as to how the sequence of page requests is generated. We prove analytically that the fault rate of our online prefetching algorithm converges almost surely for every page request sequence to the fault rate of the optimal finite state prefetcher for the sequence. This analysis model can be looked upon as a generalization of the competitive framework, in that it compares an online algorithm in a worst-case manner over all sequences with a powerful yet nonclairvoyant opponent. We simultaneously achieve the computational goal of implementing our prefetcher in optimal constant expected time per prefetched page using the optimal dynamic discrete random variate generator of Matias, Vitter, and Ni [Proc. 4th Annual SIAM/ACM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, Austin, TX, January 1993].

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an alternative, increasingly popular approach for designing expert systems that implements this approach. This paper lists pointers to some contributions in some related disciplines that offer insights for CBR research. We then outline a small number of Navy applications based on this approach that demonstrate its breadth of applicability. Finally, we list a few successful and failed attempts to apply CBR, and list some predictions on the future roles of CBR in applications. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

However, in more difficult problems - where low-level representations are present - these algorithms can perform poorly and abstract feature construction is often required. Greedy hill-climbing algorithms are harmed by feature interaction, where one attribute alone provides little information about the concept. We argue that the need for, and effects of feature construction are often swamped by the bias of the base learner. Other methods of class formation which are not as susceptable to the problems associated with low-level representation should be explored and augmented as a basis for feature construction. We present an alternative, information theoretic based approach to detecting feature interaction and develop harsher constraints on hypothesis generation, based on relative and absolute measures.

Systems have been successfully demonstrated in the areas of breaking and entering, criminal profiling, tracking serial criminals and others. In this paper, we describe the development of a system that will support police investigations in several crime areas. The methodology has been adapted from that used in several North American breaking and entering projects, to meet the requirements of the Hong Kong police. The system is initially rule-based, with provisions for investigating machine-learning and neural network techniques to improve performance and makes extensive use of existing data sources. The development of the initial demonstration system is described and the methodology is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, HA; Setiono, R				Liu, HA; Setiono, R			Incremental feature selection	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						pattern recognition; machine learning; feature selection; dimensionality reduction		Feature selection is a problem of finding relevant features. When the number of features of a dataset is large and its number of patterns is huge, an effective method of feature selection can help in dimensionality reduction. An incremental probabilistic algorithm is designed and implemented as an alternative to the exhaustive and heuristic approaches. Theoretical analysis is given to support the idea of the probabilistic algorithm in finding an optimal or near-optimal subset of features. Experimental results suggest that (1) the probabilistic algorithm is effective in obtaining optimal/suboptimal feature subsets; (2) its incremental version expedites feature selection further when the number of patterns is large and can scale up without sacrificing the quality of selected features.

J	Fall, A				Fall, A			The foundations of taxonomic encoding	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						description spaces; encoding; lattice operations; partial orders; taxonomic reasoning	HIERARCHIES; LATTICES	Taxonomies (partially ordered sets and lattices) are important in many areas of computing science, particularly object-oriented languages, machine learning, and knowledge representation. Taxonomic encoding strives to enhance the efficiency of taxonomic representation and use, which becomes increasingly important as the size of taxonomies grows. In this paper, we describe a formal structure, called a spanning set, in which taxonomic encoding techniques can be characterized. Any taxonomic encoding scheme implements a mapping from the original ordered set into a structure, such as the lattice of bit-vectors or logical terms, in which operations can be performed efficiently. We analyze the fundamental properties any such mapping must satisfy in order to preserve subsumption, joins, or meets. Spanning sets are an abstract framework within which we portray and compare existing encoding techniques, and provide a context in which new encoding problems can be analyzed, leading to existing, related algorithms or, using other results we develop in this paper, guiding the development of new algorithms. We also explore the limits of minimal-sized encodings, proving a lower bound for simple forms of encoding and showing that, in general, finding minimal-sized encodings is NP-hard. This paper can thus be viewed as both a synthesis of current research in taxonomic encoding and a repository of new results and directions for encoding as viewed from the perspective of spanning sets.

In order to improve and automate the tool selection and determination of cutting parameters in operation planning we have to re-formulate and generalise the existing machinability knowledge. In the paper the existent machinability data base was analysed by the use of machine learning methodology. A multi-stage experiment has been carried out, comprising (1) preparatory phase in which manual construction of higher level attributes and grouping of similar learning examples to obtain more consistent decision trees was performed, and (2) learning relations between workpiece materials to be machined, cutting tool features and cutting conditions. Within the learning process several decision trees have been synthesised predicting tool features, cutting geometry and cutting parameters from a set of attribute values. The investigation has revealed the extended insight into the machinability domain, as well as the possible knowledge synthesis regarding workpiece material to be machined and cutting tool as a bottom-line in operation planning for NC-programming and automated process planning.

J	Hayes, WS; Borodovsky, M				Hayes, WS; Borodovsky, M			How to interpret an anonymous bacterial genome: Machine learning approach to gene identification	GENOME RESEARCH			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SEQUENCE; PROTEIN; DNA; RECOGNITION; PREDICTION; ARCHAEON; SEARCH; MODELS	In this report we address the problem of accurate statistical modeling of DNA sequences, either coding or noncoding, for a bacterial species whose genome (or a large portion) was sequenced but not yet characterized experimentally. Availability of these models is critical for successful solution of the genome annotation task by statistical methods of gene finding. We present the method, GeneMark-Genesis, which learns the parameters of Markov models of protein-coding and noncoding regions from anonymous bacterial genomic sequence. These models are subsequently used in the GeneMark and GeneMark.hmm gene-finding programs. Although there is basically one model of a noncoding region for a given genome, several models of protein-coding region are automatically obtained by GeneMark-Genesis. The diversity of protein-coding models reflects the diversity of oligonucleotide compositions, particularly the diversity of codon usage strategies observed in genes From one and the same genome. In the simplest and the most important case, there are just two gene models-typical and atypical ones. We show that the atypical model allows one to predict genes that escape identification by the typical model. Many genes predicted by the atypical model appear to be horizontally transferred genes. The early versions of GeneMark-Genesis were used for annotating the genomes of Methanoccocus jannaschii and Helicobacter pylori. We report the results of accuracy testing of the full-scale version of GeneMark-Genesis on 10 completely sequenced bacterial genomes. Interestingly, the GeneMark.hmm program that employed the typical and atypical models defined by GeneMark-Genesis was able to predict 683 new atypical genes with 176 of them confirmed by similarity search.

Based on an extended variable-valued logic, our rule-based induction system is able to abstract compact rule sets from any set of feature vectors describing a set of classifications. The rule bases which satisfy the completeness and consistency conditions are induced and refined through five heuristic strategies. A recursive induction learning scheme in the RIEVL algorithm is designed to escape local minima in the solution space. A performance comparison of RIEVL with other inductive algorithms, ID3, NewID, C4.5, CN2, and HCV, is given in the paper. In the experiments with hand gestures, the system produced the disjunctive normal form descriptions of each pose and identified the different hand poses based on the classification rules obtained by the RIEVL algorithm. RIEVL classified 94.4 percent of the gesture images in our testing set correctly, outperforming all other inductive algorithms.

J	Dhar, V				Dhar, V			Data mining in finance: Using counterfactuals to generate knowledge from organizational information systems	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Review						knowledge discovery; machine learning; counterfactuals; organizational learning		A common view about data mining is that it is an exercise of "clustering" customers, markets, products, and other objects of interest in useful ways from large amounts of data. In this paper, I demonstrate that the real value of data mining, particularly in the financial arena, lies more in revealing actions that lead to interesting distributions of outcomes, distributions that are not directly observable in the data. Simulating actions or events that did not occur is often more useful than trying to cluster the data, which represents only those states of nature that occurred and were recorded. I show how the use of counterfactuals, which are hypothetical events, coupled with certain types of machine learning methods produce models that promote human dialog and exploration that does not otherwise occur in routine organizational activity. I demonstrate with real-world examples, how the combination of database systems, counterfactuals and machine learning methods combine to provide a powerful bottom-up theory building mechanism that is useful in enabling organizations to use databases for learning about things that are useful to them.

J	Berka, P; Bruha, I				Berka, P; Bruha, I			Empirical comparison of various discretization procedures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Letter						inductive learning; categorization; discretization		The genuine symbolic machine learning (ML) algorithms are capable of processing symbolic, categorial data only. However, real-world problems, e.g. in medicine or finance, involve both symbolic and numerical attributes. Therefore, there is an important issue of ML to discretize (categorize) numerical attributes. There exist quite a few discretization procedures in the ML field. This paper describes two newer algorithms for categorization (discretization) of numerical attributes. The first one is implemented in the KEX (Knowledge EXplorer) as its preprocessing procedure. Its idea is to discretize the numerical attributes in such a way that the resulting categorization corresponds to KEX knowledge acquisition algorithm. Since the categorization for KEX is done "off-line" before using the KEX machine learning algorithm, it can be used as a preprocessing step for other machine learning algorithms, too. The other discretization procedure is implemented in CN4, a large extension of the well-known CN2 machine learning algorithm. The range of numerical attributes is divided into intervals that may form a complex generated by the algorithm as a part of the class description. Experimental results show a comparison of performance of KEX and CN4 on some well-known ML databases. To make the comparison more exhibitory, we also used the discretization procedure of the MLC++ library. Other ML algorithms such as ID3 and C4.5 were run under our experiments, too. Then, the results are compared and discussed.

J	Kearns, M				Kearns, M			Efficient noise-tolerant learning from statistical queries	JOURNAL OF THE ACM			English	Article						computational learning theory; machine learning	EXAMPLES	In this paper, we study the problem of learning in the presence of classification noise in the probabilistic learning model of Valiant and its variants. In order to identify the class of "robust" learning algorithms in the most general way, we formalize a new but related model of learning from statistical queries. Intuitively, in this model, a learning algorithm is forbidden to examine individual examples of the unknown target function, but is given access to an oracle providing estimates of probabilities over the sample space of random examples. One of our main results shows that any class of functions learnable from statistical queries is in fact learnable with classification noise in Valiant's model, with a noise rate approaching the information-theoretic barrier of 1/2. We then demonstrate the generality of the statistical query model, showing that practically every class learnable in Valiant's model and its variants can also be learned in the new model (and thus can be learned in the presence of noise). A notable exception to this statement is the class of parity functions, which we prove is not learnable from statistical queries, and for which no noise-tolerant algorithm is known.

It is based on the criterion by Kurosky and Deutsch, with which the probability of a target conformation in a conformation space is maximized at low but finite temperature. The key feature of the proposed approach is the use of soft spins (fuzzy monomers) that leads to a design equation, which is an analog of the Boltzmann machine learning equation in the design problem. We implement an algorithm based on the design equation for the generalized HP model on the 3 x 3 x 3 cubic lattice and check its performance.

J	Sheppard, JW				Sheppard, JW			Colearning in differential games	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Markov games; differential games; pursuit games; multiagent learning; reinforcement learning; Q-learning	MODELS	Game playing has been a popular problem area for research in artificial intelligence and machine learning for many years. In almost every study of game playing and machine learning, the focus has been on games with a finite set of states and a finite set of actions. Further, most of this research has focused on a single player or team learning how to play against another player or team that is applying a fixed strategy for playing the game. In this paper, we explore multiagent learning in the context of game playing and develop algorithms for "co-learning" in which all players attempt to learn their optimal strategies simultaneously. Specifically, we address two approaches to colearning, demonstrating strong performance by a memory-based reinforcement learner and comparable but faster performance with a tree-based reinforcement learner.

The natural way for an intelligent learner to counter this problem and successfully generalize is to exploit prior information that may be available about the domain dr that can be learned from prototypical examples. We discuss the notion of using using prior knowledge by creating virtual examples and thereby expanding the effective training-set size. We show that in some contexts this ideals mathematically equivalent to incorporating the prior knowledge as a regularizer, suggesting that the strategy is well motivated. The process of creating virtual examples in real-world pattern recognition tasks is highly nontrivial. We provide demonstrative examples from object recognition and speech recognition to illustrate the idea.

J	Lecun, Y; Bottou, L; Bengio, Y; Haffner, P				Lecun, Y; Bottou, L; Bengio, Y; Haffner, P			Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Review						convolutional neural networks; document recognition; finite state transducers; gradient-based learning; graph transformer networks; machine learning; neural networks; optical character recognition (OCR)	NEURAL-NETWORK; DESCENT; ARCHITECTURE; ALGORITHM; PROCESSOR; MACHINES; DIGITS	Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient-based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, arch as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN's), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so; as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.

J	Lin, LJ; Hancock, TR; Judd, JS				Lin, LJ; Hancock, TR; Judd, JS			A robust landmark-based system for vehicle location using low-bandwidth vision	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; computer vision; robotics; autonomous navigation; landmark recognition; neural networks; Gaussian mixture		This paper presents novel computer algorithms, a system architecture, and the prototype implementation of a vision-based automatic vehicle location system. The objective of the vehicle location system is to keep track of the vehicle location for a human driver, and perhaps to provide the driver with real-time audio directions to his destination. The techniques developed here are equally applicable to autonomous robot navigation. The prototype system uses odometer readings and a skeleton map to perform dead reckoning, and uses low-bandwidth visual information and neural networks to recognize places for correcting cumulative dead reckoning errors. The visual information is also used to detect turns, for dead reckoning at intersections. The system is self-contained in the sense that it requires no infrastructure outside the vehicle, such as external beacons installed on roadways or satellites used by Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The system maintains a large number of location hypotheses and searches for a large number of landmarks stored in a database in real time. Hence the system is robustly able to recover the vehicle location after being lost for various reasons. The system has been tested, with success, in both day and night time, in all four seasons, and on roads in New York City, a regional highway, and on suburban streets. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

This article investigates a two-way active relationship between learner and domain. An active relationship is useful and even necessary if the prevailing research is to be successfully applied to real-world problems involving sparse and strongly biased data. A process development case study is used to illustrate the impact of data quality and quantity and to compare the performance of active learning against conventional passive learning. This study highlights on the need to assess data quality and demonstrates the improvements in the rate of active learning.

In this work, decision-tree approach to cell phenotype-based prognosis of CLL was adopted. The panel of 33 (32 different phenotypic features and serum concentration of sCD23) parameters was simultaneously presented to the C4.5 decision tree which extracted the most informative of them and subsequently performed classification of CLL patients against the modified Rai staging system. It has been shown that substantial correlation between the percentage of expression of the CD23 molecule on CD19(+) B-cells, the level of sCD23, the percentage of CD45RA(+), and the absolute number of CD4CD45RA(+)RO(+) T-cells and the clinical stages, exists. The prediction vector, composed of their concatenated values, was able to correctly associate 83% of the cases in the low-risk group (Rai stage 0), 100% of the cases in the intermediate-risk group (Rai stage I and II), and 89% of the cases in the high-risk group (Rai stage IB and IV) of CLL patients, Predictivity of this vector was 100%, 95%, and 89%, respectively, In conclusion, from the described analysis, it may be inferred that two processes play important roles in the progression rate of CLL: 1, deregulated function of the CD23 gene in a-cells accompanied by the appearance of its cleaved product sCD23 in the sera; and 2, functionally impaired and imbalanced CD4 T-cell subpopulations found in the peripheral blood of CLL patients, Am.

J	Kambhampati, S				Kambhampati, S			On the relations between intelligent backtracking and failure-driven explanation-based learning in constraint satisfaction and planning	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						explanation-based learning; dependency directed backtracking; constraint satisfaction; planning; regression; propagation; flaw resolution; nogood learning; dynamic backtracking	SEARCH	The ideas of intelligent backtracking (IB) and explanation-based learning (EBL) have developed independently in the constraint satisfaction, planning, machine learning and problem solving communities. The variety of approaches developed for IB and EEL in the various communities have hither-to been incomparable. In this paper, I formalize and unify these ideas under the task-independent framework of refinement search, which can model the search strategies used in both planning and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). I show that both IB and EEL depend upon the common theory of explanation analysis-which involves explaining search failures, and regressing them to higher levels of the search tree. My comprehensive analysis shows that most of the differences between the CSP and planning approaches to EEL and TB revolve around different solutions to: (a) how the failure explanations are computed; (b) how they are contextualized (contextualization involves deciding whether or not to keep the flaw description and the description of the violated problem constraints); and (c) how the storage of explanations is managed. The differences themselves can be understood in terms of the differences between planning and CSP problems as instantiations of refinement search. This unified understanding is expected to support a greater cross-fertilization of ideas among CSP, planning and EEL communities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights reserved.

J	Szczerbicka, H; Becker, M; Syrjakow, M				Szczerbicka, H; Becker, M; Syrjakow, M			Genetic algorithms: A tool for modelling, simulation, and optimization of complex systems	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article								Until very recently genetic algorithms (GAs) were considered to be the proprietary field of general systems theoreticians and important for esoteric or extremely complex optimization studies. This paper endeavors to show that GA are of great utility in cases where complex systems have to be designed and, therefore, rational choices have to be made. The GA approach is based loosely on the theory of natural evolution, genetic diversity, and searching for beneficial adaptations to a complicated and changing environment. GAs can be viewed as a modelling tool and as a technique for simulation of complex systems represented by communities of interacting units. The representation of units can express characteristics, capabilities, or relatively simple strategies. These units compete and are modified by external operators, so that the overall system adapts to its environment. That environment defines the criterion by which the success in adapting can be measured. Genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to many optimization problems including mathematical function optimization, very large scale integration (VLSI) chip layout, molecular docking, parameter fitting, scheduling, manufacturing, clustering, machine learning, etc. and are still finding increasing acceptance. Modelling and optimization of a Kanban system from the field of flexible manufacturing systems is discussed in the last section.

J	Michie, D				Michie, D			Learning concepts from data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								Current data-mining practice employs relatively :low-level machine learning algorithms-statistical, neural-net, genetic, decision-tree, etc.-to trawl large data-sets for new classifiers. Usefulness of classifiers is then assessed according to accuracy in classifying new data, e.g. for stockmarket prediction or for assigning causes in medical diagnosis. User-transparency is often a secondary consideration. But in some applications the priorities are reversed. (1) In the "designer drug" industry, predictive classifiers are more valuable if they also provide chemists with new leads, while minimizing the frequency of the false positives. Screening fossil fuel emissions for hazardous components, on the other hand, requires minimization of false negatives. The high user-transparencies required in both cases are obtainable only with relational descriptions and rule languages, going beyond attribute-value representations. (2) In the simulator training of aircraft pilots, and of operators of other real-time devices, predictive control laws can provide a basis for machine-generated real-time advice to trainees. Study of human simulator-based control learning indicates a subgoal structure. It also suggests that both acquisition by the learner of new subgoals, and reorganization of perceived causal links among problem elements are involved in real-time skill learning. Design implications for automated coaches are worthy of consideration. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, HA; Setiono, R				Liu, HA; Setiono, R			Some issues on scalable feature selection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						features; probabilistic selection; scalability; large databases; pattern classification		Feature selection determines relevant features in the data. It is often applied in pattern classification, data mining, as well as machine learning. A special concern for feature selection nowadays is that the size of a database is normally very large, both vertically and horizontally. In addition, feature sets may grow as the data collection process continues. Effective solutions are needed to accommodate the practical demands. This paper concentrates on three issues: large number of features, large data size, and expanding feature set. For the first issue, we suggest a probabilistic algorithm to select features. For the second issue, we present a scalable probabilistic algorithm that expedites feature selection further and can scale up without sacrificing the quality of selected features. For the third issue, we propose an incremental algorithm that adapts to the newly extended feature set and captures ''concept drifts' by removing features from previously selected and newly added ones. We expect that research on scalable: feature selection will be extended to distributed and parallel computing and have impact on applications of data mining and machine learning.

J	Yokomori, T; Kobayashi, S				Yokomori, T; Kobayashi, S			Learning local languages and their application to DNA sequence analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						local languages; deterministic automata; hemoglobin alpha-chain; DNA sequence analysis; machine learning	INDUCTIVE INFERENCE; SPLICING SYSTEMS	This paper concerns an efficient algorithm for learning in the limit a special type of regular languages called strictly locally testable languages from positive data, and its application to identifying the protein alpha-chain region in amino acid sequences. First, we present a linear time algorithm that, given a strictly locally testable language, learns (identifies) its deterministic finite state automaton in the limit from only positive data. This provides us with a practical and efficient method for learning a specific concept domain of sequence analysis. We then describe several experimental results using the learning algorithm developed above. Following a theoretical observation which strongly suggests that a certain type of amino acid sequences can be expressed by a locally testable language, we apply the learning algorithm to identifying the protein alpha-chain region in amino acid sequences for hemoglobin.

J	Gonzalez, A; Perez, R				Gonzalez, A; Perez, R			A fuzzy theory refinement algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						machine learning; fuzzy logic; fuzzy rules refinement	LOGIC-CONTROLLER; EXAMPLES	A fuzzy theory refinement algorithm composed of a heuristic process of generalization, specification, addition and elimination of rules is proposed. This refinement algorithm can be applied to knowledge bases obtained from several sources (learning algorithms, experts), but its development is strongly associated with the SLAVE learning system. SLAVE was developed for working with noise-affected systems where the application of some conditions of classical learning theory do not produce good descriptions. This learning system allows us to obtain the structure of the rule, i.e. it can determine among all the variables proposed those that are relevant for describing the system (feature selection). SLAVE uses an iterative approach for learning with genetic algorithms. This method is an alternative approach to the classical Pittsburgh and Michigan approach and it consists in obtaining a useful rule to describe the system in each iteration. So in this approach, the final solution is obtained from partial solutions. The refinement module appended to SLAVE (SLAVE + R) is proposed as a method for verifying that the union of the partial solutions is a good global solution. Furthermore, this module allows us to minimize the number of necessary rules, maintaining or improving the accuracy and understanding of these rules. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Velasco, JR				Velasco, JR			Genetic-based on-line learning for fuzzy process control	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							LOGIC-CONTROLLER	This paper deals with the problem of continuous learning in process control. Conventional machine learning applied to process control tries to obtain control rules from an historic data file or a model. However, these learned rules may be useless if the real process changes, and this is not unusual. To try to solve this problem, genetic algorithms can be used in a continuous learning environment. However, genetically generated rules do not guarantee that they are good enough to control the process. New rules should be tested before their insertion into the knowledge base: this is the function of Limbo. Limbo is a special place where rules can be tested in real situations before being used. This paper shows how Limbo can be used to improve continuous learning. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	Baldwin, JF; Lawry, J; Martin, TP				Baldwin, JF; Lawry, J; Martin, TP			The application of generalised fuzzy rules to machine learning and automated knowledge discovery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						generalised fuzzy rule; combination function; aggregation operator; mass assignment theory; machine learning; knowledge discovery	CONNECTIVES	Notions of generalised fuzzy conditional and equivalence rules relative to a combination function are introduced and a framework for reasoning with such rules is described. The applicability of this framework to machine learning and knowledge discovery problems is demonstrated. Methods for the automatic generation of two particular types of generalised rule are proposed. The two rule forms considered are rules with weighted AND/OR combination functions, as suggested by Zimmerman and Zysno, and evidential logic equivalence rules as defined by Baldwin. The process of generating rule bases is divided into the problem of generating fuzzy sets from data and that of finding combination functions to optimise the performance of the system given these fuzzy sets. For the former problem a mass assignment based approach is adopted and for the latter semantic discrimination analysis is used in conjunction with customised optimisation algorithms. The potential of rule bases of both forms is illustrated by their application to a number of model and real world machine learning problems.

The algorithm employs a multiplicative update rule derived using a framework introduced by Kivinen and Warmuth. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and requires only constant storage and computing time per stock in each trading period. We tested the performance of our algorithm on real stock data from the New York Stock Exchange accumulated during a 22-year period. On these data, our algorithm clearly outperforms the best single stock as well as Cover's universal portfolio selection algorithm. We also present results for the situation in which the investor has access to additional "side information."

The presentation, which spans from technological and methodological issues to several experimental results on evolution of physical mobile robots, covers both previous and recent work in the attempt to provide a unified picture within which the reader can compare the effects of systematic variations on the experimental settings. After describing some key principles for building mobile robots and tools suitable for experiments in adaptive robotics, we give an overview of different approaches to evolutionary robotics and present our methodology. We start reviewing two basic experiments showing that different environments can shape very different behaviours and neural mechanisms under very similar selection criteria. We then address the issue of incremental evolution in two different experiments from the perspective of changing environments and robot morphologies. Finally, we investigate the possibility of evolving plastic neurocontrollers and analyse an evolved neurocontroller that relies on fast and continuously changing synapses characterized by dynamic stability. We conclude by reviewing the implications of this methodology for engineering, biology, cognitive science and artificial life, and point at future directions of research.

J	Lieberman, H				Lieberman, H			Integrating user interface agents with conventional applications	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces	JAN 04-07, 1998	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA			agents; scripting languages; programming by example; programming by demonstration; machine learning; user interface		In most experiments with user interface agents to date, it has been necessary either to implement both the agent and the application from scratch, or to modify the code of an existing application to enable the necessary communication. Instead, we would like to be able to 'attach' an agent to an existing application, while requiring only a minimum of advance planning on the part of the application developer. Commercial applications an increasingly supporting the use of 'application programmers' interfaces' and scripting languages as means of achieving external control of applications. Are these mechanisms sufficient for software agents to achieve communication with applications? This paper reports some preliminary experiments in developing agent software that works with existing, unmodified commercial applications and agents that work across multiple applications. We describe a programming by example agent, ScriptAgent, that uses a scripting language, Applescript, to record example procedures that are generalized by the agent. Another approach is examinability, where the application grants to the agent the right to examine internal data structures. We present another kind of learning agent, Tatlin, that compares successive application states to infer interface operations. Finally, we discuss broader systems issues such as parallelism, interface sharing between agent and application, and access to objects. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Bernard, M; Jacquenet, F				Bernard, M; Jacquenet, F			Discovering rules to design newspapers: An inductive constraint logic programming approach	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Inductive logic programming combines both machine learning and logic programming techniques. ILP uses first-order predicate logic restricted to Horn clauses as an underlying language. Thus, programs induced by an ILP system inherit the classical limitations of PROLOG programs. Constraint logic programming avoids some of the limitations of logic programming, and so ILP aims to induce programs that employ this paradigm. Current ILP systems that induce constrained logic programs extend systems based on the normal semantics of ILP. In this article we introduce IC-Log, a new system that induces constrained logic programs and relies on an extension of a nonmonotonic semantics-based system. We then present an application of IC-Log in the field of computer-aided publishing.

Earlier experiments have demonstrated the utility of background knowledge when learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. A particular form of background knowledge comprising typical co-occurrences of several groups of attributes was provided by a medical expert. This paper explores the possibility of automating the process of acquiring background knowledge of this kind and studies the utility of such methods in the problem domain of rheumatic diseases. A method based on function decomposition is proposed that identifies typical co-occurrences for a given set of attributes. The method is evaluated by comparing the typical co;occurrences it identifies as well as their contribution to the performance of machine learning algorithms, to the ones provided by a medical expert.

J	Fu, LM				Fu, LM			A neural-network model for learning domain rules based on its activation function characteristics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						certainty factor; generalization; machine learning; neural network; rule learning; sample complexity; VC-dimension		A challenging problem in machine learning is to discover the domain rules from a limited number of instances, In a large complex: domain, it is often the case that the rules learned by the computer are at most approximate. To address this problem, this paper describes the CFNet which bases its activation function on the certainty factor (CF) model of expert systems, a new analysis on the computational complexity of rule learning in general is provided. A further analysis shows how this complexity can be reduced to a point where the domain rules can be accurately learned by capitalizing on the activation function characteristics of the CFNet. The claimed capability is adequately supported by empirical evaluations and comparisons with related systems.

J	Pierre, S				Pierre, S			Inferring new design rules by machine learning: A case study of topological optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						computer networks; inductive reaming; intelligent system; knowledge acquisition; topological design	COMPUTER-COMMUNICATION NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; METHODOLOGY; ALGORITHM	This paper presents a machine learning approach to the topological optimization of computer networks, Traditionally formulated as an integer program, this problem is well known to be a very difficult one, only solvable by means of heuristic methods. This paper addresses the specific problem of inferring new design rules that can reduce the cost of the network, or reduce the message delay below some acceptable threshold. More specifically, it extends a recent approach using a rule-based system in order to prevent the risk of combinatorial explosion and to reduce the search space of feasible network topologies. This extension essentially implements an efficient inductive learning algorithm leading to the refinement of existing rules and to the discovery of new rules from examples, defined as network topologies satisfying a given reliability constraint. The contribution of this paper is the integration of learning capabilities into topological optimization of computer networks. Computational results confirm the efficiency of the discovered rules.

J	Geczy, P; Usui, S				Geczy, P; Usui, S			Dynamic sample selection: Implementation	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						dynamic sample selection; first order optimization techniques; search direction; convergence speed		Computational expensiveness of the training techniques, due to the extensiveness of the data set, is among the most important factors in machine learning and neural networks. Oversized data set may cause rank-deficiencies of Jacobean matrix which plays essential role in training techniques. Then the training becomes not only computationally expensive but also ineffective. In [1] the authors introduced the theoretical grounds for dynamic sample selection having a potential of eliminating rank-deficiencies[2]. This study addresses the implementation issues of the dynamic sample selection based on the theoretical material presented in [1]. The authors propose a sample selection algorithm implementable into an arbitrary optimization technique. An ability of the algorithm to select a proper set of samples at each iteration of the training has been observed to be very beneficial as indicated by several experiments. Recently proposed approaches to sample selection[3]-[8] work reasonably well if pattern-weight ratio is close to 1. Small improvements can be detected also at the values of the pattern-weight ratio equal to 2 or 3. The dynamic sample selection approach, presented in this article, can increase the convergence speed of first order optimization techniques, used for training MLP networks, even at the value of the pattern-weight ratio (E-FP) as high as 15 and possibly even more.

The proposed mechanism is based on an analogical reasoning between two translation examples. Given two translation examples, the similar parts of the sentences in the source language must correspond to the similar parts of the sentences in the target language. Similarly, the different parts should correspond to the respective parts in the translated sentences. The correspondences between the similarities, and also differences are learned in the form of translation templates. The approach has been implemented and tested on a small training dataset and produced promising results for further investigation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A plug-in classification technique (PICT) is a method that takes a standard classifier (such as LDA or TREES) and plugs it into an algorithm to produce a new classifier. The standard classifier is known as the base classifier. These methods often produce large improvements over using a single classifier. In this article we investigate one of these methods and give some motivation for its success.

A review and evaluation	JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						artificial intelligence; machine learning; validation	TIME-SERIES; DECISION-SUPPORT; RESPONSE MODELS; BANKRUPTCY; SYSTEMS; EXTRAPOLATION; PERFORMANCE; DOMAINS; TOOL	Despite increasing applications of artificial neural networks (NNs) to forecasting over the past decade, opinions regarding their contribution are mixed. Evaluating research in this area has been difficult, due to lack of clear criteria. We identified eleven guidelines that could be used in evaluating this literature. Using these, we examined applications of NNs to business forecasting and prediction. We located 48 studies done between 1988 and 1994. For each, we evaluated how effectively the proposed technique was compared with alternatives (effectiveness of validation) and how well the technique was implemented (effectiveness of implementation). We found that eleven of the studies were both effectively validated and implemented. Another eleven studies were effectively validated and produced positive results, even though there were some problems with respect to the quality of their NN implementations.

J	Sill, J				Sill, J			The capacity of monotonic functions	DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension	SEP 09-13, 1996	EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND					We consider the class M of monotonically increasing binary output functions. M has considerable practical significance in machine learning and pattern recognition because prior information often suggests a monotonic relationship between input and output variables. The decision boundaries of monotonic classifiers are compared and contrasted with those of linear classifiers. M is shown to have a VC dimension of infinity, meaning that the VC bounds cannot guarantee generalization independent of input distribution. We demonstrate that when the input distribution is taken into account, however, the VC bounds become useful because the annealed VC entropy of M is modest for many distributions. Techniques for estimating the capacity and bounding the annealed VC entropy of M given the input distribution are presented and implemented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, A; Cheng, CH; Balakrishnan, J				Lee, A; Cheng, CH; Balakrishnan, J			Software development cost estimation: Integrating neural network with cluster analysis	INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						software development cost; neural network; cluster analysis; machine learning	SYSTEM-DEVELOPMENT; TREES	For software project planning control and management, an accurate estimate of software development cost is important. Past research has focused on using parametric models to predict development cost based on attributes such as lines of code or function points. This requires researchers to identify the set of factors that influence cost estimation before the system is constructed. We propose a non-parametric approach that integrates a neural network method with cluster analysis to estimate development cost. The integration of the two techniques not only allows for a more accurate cost estimate but also leads to an increase in the training efficacy of the network. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Ar, S; Lipton, RJ; Rubinfeld, R; Sudan, M				Ar, S; Lipton, RJ; Rubinfeld, R; Sudan, M			Reconstructing algebraic functions from mixed data	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						Bezout's theorem; error correcting codes; multivariate polynomials; PAC learning; noisy interpolation; polynomial factoring; polynomial interpolation	POLYNOMIALS	We consider a variant of the traditional task of explicitly reconstructing algebraic functions from black box representations. In the traditional setting for such problems, one is given access to an unknown function f that is represented by a black box, or an oracle, which can be queried for the value of f at any input. Given a guarantee that this unknown function f is some nice algebraic function, say a polynomial in its input of degree bound d, the goal of the reconstruction problem is to explicitly determine the coefficients of the unknown polynomial. All work on polynomial interpolation, especially sparse ones, are or may be presented in such a setting. The work of Kaltofen and Trager [Computing with polynomials given by black boxes for their evaluations: Greatest common divisors, factorization, separation of numerators and denominators, in Proc. 29th Ann. IEEE Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, 1988, pp. 296-305], for instance, highlights the utility of this setting, by performing numerous manipulations on polynomials presented as black boxes. The variant considered in this paper differs from the traditional setting in that our black boxes represent several algebraic functions f(1),...,f(k), where at each input x, the box arbitrarily chooses a subset of f(1)(x),...,f(k)(x) to output and we do not know which subset it outputs. We show how to reconstruct the functions f(1),...,f(k) from the black box, provided the black box outputs according to these functions "often." This allows us to group the sample points into sets, such that for each set, all outputs to points in the set are from the same algebraic function. Our methods are robust in the presence of a small fraction of arbitrary errors in the black box. Our model and techniques can be applied in the areas of computer vision, machine learning, curve fitting and polynomial approximation, self-correcting programs, and bivariate polynomial factorization.

Such information is often relational and is best represented by a set of directed graphs. A machine learning technique called graph-based induction (GBI) efficiently extracts regularities from such data, based on which a user-adaptive interface is built that can predict the next command, generate scripts and prefetch files in a multi task environment. The heart of GET is pairwise chunking. The paper shows how this simple mechanism applies to the top down induction of decision trees for nested attribute representation as well as finding frequently occurring patterns in a graph. The results clearly shows that the dependency analysis of computational processes activated by the user commands which is made possible by GBI is indeed useful to build a behavior model and increase prediction accuracy.

J	Baram, Y				Baram, Y			Partial classification: The benefit of deferred decision	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						classification; pattern recognition; hypothesis testing; decision making; machine learning; stock trading; medical diagnosis		It is shown that partial classification, which allows for indecision in certain regions of the data space, can increase a benefit function, defined as the difference between the probabilities of correct and incorrect decisions, joint with the event that a decision is made. This is particularly true for small data samples, which may cause a large deviation of the estimated separation surface from the intersection surface between the corresponding probability density functions. Employing a particular density estimation method, an indecision domain is naturally defined by a single parameter, whose optimal size, maximizing the benefit function, is derived from the data. The benefit function is shown to translate into profit in stock trading. Employing medical and economic data, it is shown that partial classification produces, on average, higher benefit values than full classification, assigning each new object to a class, and that the marginal benefit of partial classification reduces as the data size increases.

Particularly, rule induction approaches constitute prominent machine learning methods that lead to avoid the disadvantages of the decision tree. The fuzzy incremental production rule (FIPR) based system is a rule induction system that generates imprecise and uncertain IF-THEN rules from data records. It allows the incremental maintenance of the knowledge base with a minimal overhead. The precision analysis with real world data sets, and the complexity analysis are used to compare this system with existing ones and to prove the usefulness of fuzzy knowledge representation.

J	Setnes, M; Babuska, R; Verbruggen, HB				Setnes, M; Babuska, R; Verbruggen, HB			Transparent fuzzy modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article							SYSTEMS; IDENTIFICATION	One of the objectives of machine learning is to enable intelligent systems to acquire knowledge in a highly automated manner. In systems modelling and control engineering, fuzzy systems have shown to be highly suitable for the modelling of complex and uncertain systems. Recently, the interest in fuzzy systems has shifted from the seminal ideas about modelling the process or the behaviour of operators by knowledge acquisition towards a data-driven approach. Reasons to choose fuzzy systems instead of modelling techniques such as neural networks, radial basis functions, genetic algorithms or splines, are mainly the possibility of integrating logical information processing with the attractive mathematical properties of general function approximators. Furthermore, the rule-based structure of fuzzy systems makes analysis easier. The fuzzy sets in the rules represent linguistic qualitative terms that approximate the human-like way of information quantization. However, many of the data-driven fuzzy modelling algorithms that have been developed, aim at good numerical approximation and pay little attention to the semantical properties of the resulting rule base. In this article, we briefly discuss different approaches to data-intensive fuzzy modelling reported in the literature. Next, we present a data-driven approach to fuzzy modelling that provides the user with both accurate and transparent rule bases. The method has two main steps: data exploration by means of fuzzy clustering and fuzzy set aggregation by means of similarity analysis. First, fuzzy relations are identified in the product space of the system's variables and are described by means of fuzzy production rules. Compatible fuzzy concepts defined for the individual variables are then identified and aggregated to produce generalizing concepts, giving a comprehensible rule base with increased semantic properties. The transparent fuzzy modelling approach is demonstrated on a real world problem concerning the modelling of algae growth in lakes. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

J	Fensel, D; Benjamins, VR				Fensel, D; Benjamins, VR			The role of assumptions in knowledge engineering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							PROBLEM-SOLVING METHODS; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	Problem-solving methods are means of describing the inference process of knowledge-based systems. In recent years, a number of these problem-solving methods have been identified that can be reused for building new systems. However, problem-solving methods require specific types of domain knowledge and introduce specific restrictions on the tasks that can be solved by them. These requirements and restrictions are assumptions that play a key role in the reuse of problem-solving methods, in the acquisition of domain knowledge, and in the definition of the problem that can be tackled by knowledge-based systems. In this paper we discuss the different roles assumptions play in the development of knowledge-based systems and provide a survey of assumptions used in diagnostic problem solving. We show how such assumptions introduce targets and bias for goal-driven machine learning and knowledge discovery techniques. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Many practical applications relating to this field have been developed. New methods have appeared in recent years, due to developments concerning Neural Networks and Machine Learning. These "hybrid" approaches share one common factor in that they combine symbolic and numerical aspects. The former are characterized by the representation of knowledge, the latter by the introduction of frequencies and probabilistic criteria. In the present study, we shall present a certain number of hybrid methods, conceived (or improved) by members of the SYMENU research group. These methods issue mainly from Machine Learning and from research on Classification Trees done in Statistics, and they may also be qualified as "rule-based". They shall be compared with other more classical approaches. This comparison will be based on a detailed description of each of the twelve methods envisaged, and on the results obtained concerning the "Waveform Recognition Problem" proposed by Breiman et al.,(4) which is difficult for rule based approaches.

J	Egresits, C; Monostori, L; Hornyak, J				Egresits, C; Monostori, L; Hornyak, J			Multistrategy learning approaches to generate and tune fuzzy control structures and their application in manufacturing	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						intelligent manufacturing; machine learning; neuro-fuzzy systems; genetic algorithms		Intelligence is strongly connected with learning adapting abilities, therefore such capabilities are considered as indispensable features of intelligent manufacturing systems (IMSs). A number of approaches have been described to apply different machine learning (ML) techniques for manufacturing problems, starting with rule induction in symbolic domains and pattern recognition techniques in numerical, subsymbolic domains. In recent years, artificial neural network (ANN) based learning is the dominant ML technique in manufacturing. However, mainly because of the 'black box' nature of ANNs, these solutions have limited industrial acceptance. In the paper, the integration of neural and fuzzy techniques is treated and former solutions are analysed. A genetic algorithm (Gli) based approach is introduced to overcome problems that are experienced during manufacturing applications with other algorithms.

The main part of the expenditure concerning simulation analyses is the modelling of the considered production. Despite the use of modern building-block-oriented modelling technology, this modelling can often not be done by the user, but only by external experts. Against this backdrop, an adaptive simulation system is being developed by the Institute for Industrial Manufacturing and Management (IFF) at the University of Stuttgart. It independently adapts to real production processes, i.e. it learns about the interdependencies of production processes, and, in this way, supports the user in constructing and maintaining the model. In terms of information technology, the research in the field of artificial intelligence, especially in the subdomain of machine learning, is the basis for the realization of such adaptive systems.

J	Harries, MB; Sammut, C; Horn, K				Harries, MB; Sammut, C; Horn, K			Extracting hidden context	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						hidden context; concept drift; batch learning; contextual clustering; context-sensitive learning		Concept drift due to hidden changes in context complicates learning in many domains including financial prediction, medical diagnosis, and communication network performance. Existing machine learning approaches to this problem use an incremental learning, on-line paradigm. Batch, off-line learners tend to be ineffective in domains with hidden changes in context as they assume that the training set is homogeneous. An off-line, meta-learning approach for the identification of hidden context is presented. The new approach uses an existing batch learner and the process of contextual clustering to identify stable hidden contexts and the associated context specific, locally stable concepts. The approach is broadly applicable to the extraction of context reflected in time and spatial attributes. Several algorithms for the approach are presented and evaluated. A successful application of the approach to a complex flight simulator control task is also presented.

J	Korb, KB				Korb, KB			The frame problem: An AI fairy tale	MINDS AND MACHINES			English	Article						artificial intelligence; frame problem; causal induction; machine learning; logicism; Bayesian learning; MML	INFERENCE	I analyze the frame problem and its relation to other epistemological problems for artificial intelligence, such as the problem of induction, the qualification problem and the "general" AI problem. I dispute the claim that extensions to logic (default logic and circumscriptive logic) will ever offer a viable way out of the problem. In the discussion it will become clear that the original frame problem is really a fairy tale: as originally presented, and as tools for its solution are circumscribed by Pat Hayes, the problem is entertaining, but incapable of resolution. The solution to the frame problem becomes available, and even apparent, when we remove artificial restrictions on its treatment and understand the interrelation between the frame problem and the many other problems for artificial epistemology. I present the solution to the frame problem: an adequate theory and method for the machine induction of causal structure. Whereas this solution is clearly satisfactory in principle, and in practice real progress has been made in recent years in its application, its ultimate implementation is in prospect only for future generations of AI researchers.

J	Szilas, N; Cadoz, C				Szilas, N; Cadoz, C			Adaptive networks for physical modeling	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						recurrent networks; physical modeling; active learning	NEURAL NETWORKS	This paper presents an original link between neural networks theory and mechanical modeling networks. The problem is to find the parameters characterizing mechanical structures in order to reproduce given mechanical behaviors. Replacing "neural" units with mechanically based units and applying classical learning algorithms dedicated to supervised dynamic networks to these mechanical networks allows us to find the parameters for a physical model. Some new variants of real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) are also introduced, based on mechanical principles. The notion of interaction during learning is discussed at length and the results of tests are presented, Instead of the classical {machine learning system, environment} pair, we propose to study the {machine learning system, human operator, environment} triplet. Experiments have been carried out in simulated scenarios and some original experiments with a force-feedback device are also described. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kattan, MW; Cooper, RB				Kattan, MW; Cooper, RB			The predictive accuracy of computer-based classification decision techniques. A review and research directions	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						machine learning; neural networks; classification decisions; artificial intelligence; decision making; modeling; simulation	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MODELS	Computer-based classification decision (CBCD) techniques can be important assets to organizations, However, empirical research evaluating CBCD performance has been inconsistent, resulting in a lack of understanding concerning various techniques' relative merits, An important reason for this is the absence of a theoretically-based research framework that can increase the productivity of CBCD empirical work. Employing statistical prediction theory, this paper provides such a framework, Research productivity ran be improved by using the framework to help focus investigations on potentially important areas. A review of the empirical CBCD Literature indicates that, though many of the propositions derived from the framework are acknowledged as important, few have been examined. Research productivity can also be improved when researchers are able to make judgments concerning the similarity of research contests. For example, if characteristics important to CBCD accuracy are used to describe data sets employed, subsequent research can use such descriptions to create research designs that build on and extend previous research efforts. The framework offered in this paper enables such judgments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Machine learning techniques (MLT) are based on mathematical computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. They scour databases for hidden patterns, finding predictive information that experts may miss because it lies outside their expectations. This type of data-derived classification can serve two purposes: 1) to help to predict the individual risk of relapse and death corresponding to measurement vectors (prognostic factors) as accurately as possible, and 2) to understand the structural relationship between the individual risk and the measured variables. In contrast to neuronal networks, MLT works on the basis of engineering rule-based systems to generate specific decision structures. We used MLT to describe the special pattern of the prognostic variables characterizing patients with primary breast cancer for high or low risk of tumor relapse.

J	Tanaka, T				Tanaka, T			Mean-field theory of Boltzmann machine learning	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							SPIN-GLASS MODEL; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	I present a mean-field theory for Boltzmann machine learning, derived by employing Thouless-Anderson-Palmer free energy formalism to a full extent. Using the Plefka expansion an extended theory that takes higher-order correction to mean-field free energy formalism into consideration is presented, from which the mean-field approximation of general orders, along with the linear response correction, are derived by truncating the Plefka expansion up to desired orders. A theoretical foundation for an effective trick of using "diagonal weights," introduced by Kappen and Rodriguez, is also given. Because of the finite system size and a lack of scaling assumptions on interaction coefficients, the truncated free energy formalism cannot provide an exact description in the case of Boltzmann machines. Accuracies of mean-field approximations of several orders are compared by computer simulations.

J	Agarwal, PK; Suri, S				Agarwal, PK; Suri, S			Surface approximation and geometric partitions	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						approximation algorithms; dynamic programming; levels of detail; machine learning; terrains; simplification; visualization	PIECEWISE-LINEAR-APPROXIMATION; BINARY SPACE PARTITIONS; ALGORITHMS; OBJECTS	Motivated by applications in computer graphics, visualization, and scientific computation, we study the computational complexity of the following problem: given a set S of n points sampled from a bivariate function f(x, y) and an input parameter epsilon > 0, compute a piecewise-linear function Sigma(x, y) of minimum complexity (that is, an xy-monotone polyhedral surface, with a minimum number of vertices, edges, or faces) such that \Sigma(x(p), y(p)) - z(p)\ less than or equal to epsilon for all (x(p), y(p), z(p)) is an element of S. We give hardness evidence for this problem, by showing that a closely related problem is NP-hard. The main result of our paper is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that computes a piecewise-linear surface of size O(K-o log K-o), where K-o is the complexity of an optimal surface satisfying the constraints of the problem. The technique developed in our paper is more general and applies to several other problems that deal with partitioning of points (or other objects) subject to certain geometric constraints. For instance, we get the same approximation bound for the following problem arising in machine learning: given n "red" and m "blue" points in the plane, find a minimum number of pairwise disjoint triangles such that each blue point is covered by some triangle and no red point lies in any of the triangles.

The domain contains records of patients with known diagnosis. Given a training set of such records, the VFI5 classifier learns how to differentiate a new case in the domain. VFI5 represents a concept in the form of feature intervals on each feature dimension separately. classification in the VFI5 algorithm is based on a real-valued voting. Each feature equally participates in the voting process and the class that receives the maximum amount of votes is declared to be the predicted class. The performance of the VFI5 classifier is evaluated empirically in terms of classification accuracy and running time. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Services such as information finding, filtering and presentation, service/contract negotiation, and electronic commerce are now possible. User profiling is fundamental to the personalisation of this technology. This paper describes experimental work conducted to investigate user profiling within a framework for personal agents, in particular, investigations were aimed at discovering whether user interests could be automatically classified through the use of several heuristics. The results highlighted the need for minimal user feedback, and the need to consider the implications for the role of machine learning in user profiling.

J	Voigt, TB; Fermanian, TW; Sullivan, WC				Voigt, TB; Fermanian, TW; Sullivan, WC			Selecting Kentucky bluegrass cultivars	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article								A computer-aided learning process has been previously developed to identify unique turfgrass cultivar performance levels under specific growing conditions, However, it was not determined if this process was similar to the routine assessments made by turfgrass experts, A survey was sent to 191 turfgrass experts to determine turf cultivar recommendation consistency, to validate a set of computer developed rules of association, and to determine the environmental and management characteristics the experts considered most influential on turfgrass cultivar performance. Seventy completed surveys, mostly from respondents who had worked professionally for at least 10 yr at Land Grant universities, were returned. In the first section of the survey, experts showed a high degree of consistency in recommending Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) cultivars for specific settings. In the second section of the survey, there was inconsistent agreement among survey respondents and machine learning output when presented with rules associating cultivar performance and turf settings. Finally, when asked to indicate which environment or management parameters experts felt most influence performance of specific Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, survey respondents selected mowing height, nitrogen fertilization levels, and irrigation, The computer-aided learning process also identified mowing height and nitrogen fertilization levels as influencing cultivar performance. The machine learning process also selected soil pH and average monthly air temperature as influential, Thus, there was not overall agreement between survey respondents and machine learning output.

In a series of studies exploring alternative approaches, 200 cross-flow junction road accidents were sampled from the files of Nottinghamshire Constabulary, UK, coded for computer analysis using a specially devised 'Traffic Related Action Analysis Language', and then examined using different computational and statistical techniques. The present study employed an AI machine-learning method based on Quinlan's 'ID3' algorithm to create decision trees distinguishing the characteristics of accidents that resulted in injury or in damage only; accidents of young male drivers; and those of the relatively more and less dangerous situations. For example the severity of accidents involving turning onto a main road could be determined with 79% accuracy from the nature of the other vehicle, season, junction type, and whether the Turner failed to notice another road user. Accidents involving young male drivers could be identified with 77% accuracy by knowing if the junction was complex, and whether the Turner waited or slowed before turning.

J	Li, XQ; Jabri, MA				Li, XQ; Jabri, MA			Machine learning-based VLSI cells shape function estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						dimension estimation; floorplanning; layout aspect ratios; neural networks; number of contacts; shape functions		We describe in this paper a novel approach based upon machine learning for estimating layout shape functions of full-custom integrated circuit cells, A neural network is trained to estimate one dimension of cell layout from circuit netlist, a desired packing density, and prescribed values of the complementary dimension. The neural network is then combined with a linear function generator and a neural network that predicts the number of contacts (vias) to produce estimates of cell layout shape functions, We have experimented with this approach on an independent test set of circuits and the results are very encouraging. The resulting estimation system is very fast and can be easily incorporated into exiting floorplanning systems. An additional benefit of the the machine learning aspect is the simplicity and systematicity in incorporating into the estimation system new circuits and technology information as they become available.

J	Mataric, MJ				Mataric, MJ			Using communication to reduce locality in distributed multiagent learning	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						robotics; machine learning; distributed AI; multi-agent systems; communication between agents		This paper attempts to bridge the fields of machine learning, robotics, and distributed AI. It discusses the use of communication in reducing the undesirable effects of locality in fully distributed multi-agent systems with multiple agents/robots learning in parallel while interacting with each other. Two key problems, hidden state and credit assignment, are addressed by applying local undirected broadcast communication in a dual role: as sensing and as reinforcement. The methodology is demonstrated on two multi-robot learning experiments. The first describes learning a tightly-coupled coordination task with two robots, the second a loosely-coupled task with four robots learning social rules. Communication is used to (1)share sensory data to overcome hidden state and (2) share reinforcement to overcome the credit assignment problem between the agents and bridge the gap between local/individual and global/group pay-off.

J	Wong, JSK; Nayar, R; Mikler, AR				Wong, JSK; Nayar, R; Mikler, AR			A framework for a World Wide Web-based Data Mining system	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article								The phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) introduces new vistas for trade and commerce. In addition to overcoming the difficulties of distances, cultures and languages, the WWW provides another important business resource: information. Spurred on by the development of better data storage and retrieval techniques, companies are beginning to provide more information about themselves and their activities. This widespread information dissemination necessitates the development of tools which can process it, The application of machine learning algorithms to this vast quantity of data can yield useful information, which can be used for individual and corporate decision support. One example of many possible applications of Data Mining, the system described in this paper, deals with stock-market data available on certain Web-sites. It classifies these stocks as buy or sell using the decision tree technique. The user interaction is through a Web browser, which makes the Web-based nature of the data gathering and processing transparent to the user. A number of experiments are conducted to gauge the performance of the classification. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

Different techniques exist to construct more stable classifiers. It is not clear which ones are good, and whether they really stabilize the classifier or just improve the performance. In this paper bagging (bootstrapping and aggregating) [L. Breiman, Bagging predictors, Machine Learning J. 24(2), 123-140(1996)] is studied for a number of linear classifiers. A measure for the instability of classifiers is introduced. The influence of regularization and bagging on this instability and the generalization error of linear classifiers is investigated. In a simulation study it is shown that in general bagging is not a stabilizing technique. It is also demonstrated that one can consider the instability of the classifier to predict how useful bagging will be. Finally, it is shown experimentally that bagging might improve the performance of the classifier only for very unstable situations. (C) 1998 Pattern Recognition Society.

J	Suppes, P; Bottner, M				Suppes, P; Bottner, M			Robotic machine learning of anaphora	ROBOTICA			English	Article						anaphora; machine learning; robots	COMPREHENSION GRAMMARS; LANGUAGES	Our contribution tackles the problem of learning to understand anaphoric references in the context of robotic machine learning; e.g. Get the large screw. Put it in the left hole. Our solution assumes the probabilistic theory of learning spelt out in earlier publications. Associations are formed probabilistically between constituents of the verbal command and constituents of a presupposed internal representation. The theory is extended, as a first step, to anaphora by learning how to distinguish between incorrect surface depth and the correct tree-structure depth of the anaphoric references.

A formulation is given of the problem of the automatic discovery of such patterns from a set of sequences, and an analysis is presented of the ways in which an assessment can be made of the significance of the discovered patterns, It is shown that the problem is related to problems studied in the field of machine learning, The major part of this paper comprises a review of a number of existing methods developed to solve the problem and how these relate to each other, focusing on the algorithms underlying the approaches, A comparison is given of the algorithms, and examples are given of patterns that have been discovered using the different methods.

In the 1980s, knowledge-based techniques also made an impressive contribution to "intelligent" information retrieval and indexing. More recently, information science researchers have turned to other newer inductive learning techniques including symbolic learning, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. These newer techniques, which are grounded in diverse paradigms, have provided great opportunities for researchers to enhance the information processing and retrieval capabilities of current information systems, In this article, we first provide an overview of these newer techniques and their use in information retrieval research. In order to familiarize readers with the techniques, we present three promising methods: The symbolic ID3 algorithm, evolution-based genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. We discuss their knowledge representations and algorithms in the unique context of information retrieval, An experiment using a 8000-record COMPEN database was performed to examine the performances of these inductive query-by-example techniques in comparison with the performance of the conventional relevance feedback method. The machine learning techniques were shown to be able to help identify new documents which are similar to documents initially suggested by users, and documents which contain similar concepts to each other. Genetic algorithms, in particular, were found to out-perform relevance feedback in both document recall and precision. We believe these inductive machine learning techniques hold promise for the ability to analyze users' preferred documents (or records), identify users' underlying information needs, and also suggest alternatives for search for database management systems and Internet applications.

This work presents the creation of the QM structure that emulates the generation of Evoked Potentials, EP. Materials and methods: QM system combines 4 groups of techniques: Analytical. Machine Learning; Personal judgement; Graphic interaction. The response of QM, has been compared with the experimentally observed evoked potential: in human, after short auditory stimulation; in human, after the stimulation with the verbal stimuli; in mice and wistar rats after short electrical pulse stimulation. Results: QM structure is based on the Quantum Mind Theory with the focus on the Primary Oscillators PO. Each PO defines the basic timing and behavior of an agent, or oscillator; Flocks of agents operate in parallel and sequentially. The EP record represents the filtered self organized activity of a large set of these individual agents or oscillators. Conclusion: Using the Evolution and Association breeder EVA, the highly lit individual QM structure is found. QM responds to the received stimulus in the same way as a natural brain. QM generated Eps are presented, related to healthy and diabetic rodents. normal and sclerotic patients verbal stimulation and perception. Applications: Biomedical research; clinical diagnoses; drug testing; QM computing systems; man-machine interfaces; self-organized media; data compression in Internet browsing.

J	Hong, TP; Wang, CH; Tseng, SS				Hong, TP; Wang, CH; Tseng, SS			Trade-off between requirement of learning and computational cost	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						two-phase learning; PRISM; batch learning; incremental learning; multi-strategy learning; refinement	KNOWLEDGE	Machine learning in real-world situations sometimes starts from an initial collection of training instances; learning then proceeds off and on as new training instances come intermittently. The idea of two-phase learning has then been proposed here for effectively solving the learning problems in which training instances came in this two-stage way. Four two-phase learning algorithms based on the learning method PRISM have also been proposed for inducing rules from training instances. These alternatives form a spectrum, showing achievement of the requirement of PRISM (keeping down the number of irrelevant attributes) heavily dependent on the spent computational cost. The suitable alternative, as a trade-off between computational costs and achievement to the requirements, can then be chosen according to the request of the application domains.

J	Gonzalez, A; Perez, R				Gonzalez, A; Perez, R			Completeness and consistency conditions for learning fuzzy rules	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; classification problems; fuzzy logic; fuzzy rules; genetic algorithms	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SYSTEMS	The completeness and consistency conditions were introduced in order to achieve acceptable concept recognition rules. In real problems, we can handle noise-affected examples and it is not always possible to maintain both conditions. Moreover, when we use fuzzy information there is a partial matching between examples and rules, therefore the consistency condition becomes a matter of degree. In this paper, a learning algorithm based on soft consistency and completeness conditions is proposed. This learning algorithm combines in a single process rule and feature selection and it is tested on different databases. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hand, DJ				Hand, DJ			Data mining: Statistics and more?	AMERICAN STATISTICIAN			English	Article						databases; exploratory data analysis; knowledge discovery		Data mining is a new discipline lying at the interface of statistics, database technology, pattern recognition, machine learning, and other areas. It is concerned with the secondary analysis of large databases in order to find previously unsuspected relationships which are of interest or value to the database owners. New problems arise, partly as a consequence of the sheer size of the data sets involved, and partly because of issues of pattern matching. However, since statistics provides the intellectual glue underlying the effort, it is important for statisticians to become involved. There are very real opportunities for statisticians to make significant contributions.

J	Bredensteiner, EJ; Bennett, KP				Bredensteiner, EJ; Bennett, KP			Feature minimization within decision trees	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data mining; machine learning; feature minimization; decision trees; bilinear programming	NETWORKS	Decision trees for classification can be constructed using mathematical programming. Within decision tree algorithms, the feature minimization problem is to construct accurate decisions using as few features or attributes within each decision as possible. Feature minimization is an important aspect of data mining since it helps identify what attributes are important and helps produce accurate and interpretable decision trees. In feature minimization with bounded accuracy, we minimize the number of features using a given misclassification error tolerance. This problem can be formulated as a parametric bilinear program and is shown to be NP-complete. A parametric Frank-Wolfe method is used to solve the bilinear subproblems. The resulting minimization algorithm produces more compact, accurate, and interpretable trees. This procedure can be applied to many different error functions. Formulations and results for two error functions are given. One method, FM_RLP-P, dramatically reduced the number of features of one dataset from 147 to 2 while maintaining an 83.6% testing accuracy. Computational results compare favorably with the standard univariate decision tree method, C4.5, as well as with linear programming methods of tree construction.

Difficulties with search on Internet will worsen as the amount of on-line information increases. A scalable approach to Internet search is critical to the success of Internet services and other current and future National Information Infrastructure (NII) applications. As part of the ongoing Illinois Digital Library Initiative project, this research proposes an intelligent personal spider (agent) approach to Internet searching. The approach, which is grounded on automatic textual analysis and general-purpose search algorithms, is expected to be an improvement over the current static and inefficient Internet searches. In this experiment, we implemented Internet personal spiders based on best first search and genetic algorithm techniques. These personal spiders can dynamically take a user's selected starting homepages and search for the most closely related homepages in the web, based on the links and keyword indexing. A plain, static CGI/HTML-based interface was developed earlier, followed by a recent enhancement of a graphical, dynamic Java-based interface. Preliminary evaluation results and two working prototypes (available for Web access) are presented. Although the examples and evaluations presented are mainly based on Internet applications, the applicability of the proposed techniques to the potentially more rewarding Intranet applications should be obvious. In particular, we believe the proposed agent design can be used to locate organization-wide information, to gather new, time-critical organizational information, and to support team-building and communication in Intranets.

In our work we apply such a machine learning technique to the modelling of population dynamics of red deer for the 40000 hectares co-natural manage forest area on high Karst of Notranjska in Slovenia. We used the RETIS program, a machine learning tool developed by A. Karalie at the Institute Jozef Stefan in Ljubljana. This program induces regression trees from data, and has already been applied to several ecological problems. RETIS was applied on data, collected in the period 1976-1994, which included several meteorological parameters, parameters about the state of the forest, and parameters about the population of the red deer. Given these data about the observed system, the system RETIS automatically induces a model which has the form of a regression tree. We evaluate our induced models qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative evaluation, we present an expert interpretation of the models. We show that quantitatively, using the models (we use a relative prediction error) and given the meteorological parameters during winter and summer and an estimate of the number of red deer in the area, it is possible to predict the state of the forest in the near future. This is very important for maintaining the balance between red deer population and other parameters of the forest, which will allow sustainable development of the complex forest ecosystem.

J	Branco, PJC; Dente, JA				Branco, PJC; Dente, JA			The application of fuzzy logic in automatic modelling of electromechanical systems	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						linguistic modelling; approximate reasoning; pattern recognition; machine learning		Electromechanical systems are usually modelled using energy conversion theory. However, this representation is not accurate enough. The reasons are the presence of non-linear relations between the variables, changes in system parameters, and the difficulty encountered sometimes in taking into account, in a simple and precise way, physical phenomena like, friction, viscosity, and saturation. So, it is useful to automatically extract the relations that represent the system behaviour. We investigate in this paper three fuzzy learning algorithms which represent the development of our study and are used for automatic modelling of electromechanical systems. We begin with a very simple algorithm. Some problems are pointed as containing the requisites to be a good model; next, two methods which are composed of a fuzzy-cluster-based algorithm and a fuzzy-supervised-learning algorithm are employed. We explore their learning capabilities in situations like modelling in a direct and inverse way, the amount of information necessary to build a good model, and the problem of selecting the information relevant to the learning process. The algorithms are analysed in an experimental system in our laboratory. We close with a simple control application for the relationship between fuzzy modelling and electromechanical systems designing a feedforward learning controller for the experimental system.

Algorithms for constructing knowledge by inductive inference from example have been widely used for some decades. Although these learning algorithms frequently address the same problem of learning from preclassified examples and much previous work in inductive learning has focused on the algorithms' predictive accuracy, little attention has been paid to the effect of data factors on the performance of a learning system. An experiment was conducted using five learning algorithms on two data sets to investigate how the change in labeling the class attribute can alter the behavior of learning algorithms. The results show that different preclassification rules applied on the training examples can affect either the classification accuracy or classification structure.

J	Wang, XZ; Chen, BH				Wang, XZ; Chen, BH			Clustering of infrared spectra of lubricating base oils using adaptive resonance theory	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							PATTERN-RECOGNITION; NEURAL-NETWORK; MASS-SPECTRA; CLASSIFICATION	Adaptive resonance theory (ART2) is applied to the classification of lubricating base oils on the basis of their infrared spectra. Fifty-nine data samples are used which were collected from 12 refineries representing eight crude oil origins. The ART2 neural network is an unsupervised machine learning approach which is different from supervised learning, such as back-propagation neural networks, in that it determines both the number of classes and the assignments of data samples. The ART2 groups the 59 data samples into seven classes. Five of the seven classes an found to perfectly match the crude oil origins. Two of the seven classes (eight samples in total) are combined to form a single class. The class assignment of one data sample (sample 35) does not match the crude oil origin but is consistent with the prior observation of its spectrum.

J	Zheng, ZJ				Zheng, ZJ			Constructing conjunctions using systematic search on decision trees	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	FEB 22-23, 1997	SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE			knowledge discovery; machine learning; constructive induction		This paper investigates a dynamic path-based method for constructing conjunctions as new attributes for decision toe learning. It searches for conditions (attribute-value pairs) from paths to form new attributes. Compared with other hypothesis-driven new attribute construction methods, the new idea of this method is that it carries out a systematic search with pruning over each path of a tree to select conditions for generating a conjunction. Therefore, conditions for constructing new attributes are dynamically decided during the search. Empirically, evaluation in a set of artificial and real-world domains shows that the dynamic path-based method can improve the performance of selective decision tree learning in terms of both higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity. In addition, it shows some performance advantages over a fixed path-based method and a fixed rule-based method for learning decision trees. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Blue, JA; Bennett, KP				Blue, JA; Bennett, KP			Hybrid extreme point tabu search	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						tabu search; global optimization; bilinear programming; machine learning; classification	DIAGNOSIS	We develop a new hybrid tabu search method for optimizing a continuous differentiable function over the extreme points of a polyhedron. The method combines extreme point tabu search (EPTS) with traditional descent algorithms based on linear programming. The tabu search algorithm utilizes both recency-based and frequency-based memory and oscillates between local improvement and diversification phases. The hybrid algorithm iterates between using a descent algorithm to find a local minimum and tabu search to improve locally and then move to a new area of the search space. The descent algorithm acts as a form of intensification within the tabu search. This algorithm can be used on many important classes of problems in global optimization including bilinear programming, multilinear programming, multiplicative programming, concave minimization, and complementarity problems. The algorithm is applied to two practical problems: the quasistatic multi-rigid-body contact problem (QCP) in robotics and the global tree optimization (GTO) problem in machine learning. We perform computational experiments on problems of significant real world dimensions: the smallest machine learning problem tested has on the order of 10(485) extreme points. The results show our method obtains high quality solutions both by comparison with the embedded descent algorithm and by comparison to a version of tabu search that does not make use of descent.

A number of variations are discussed including constrained, unconstrained and augmented concept lattices. Bounds for worst case behaviour, as well as conditions under which worst-case behaviour arises, are adduced. It is argued that worst-case behaviour is unlikely to arise in applications which are amenable to machine learning. Pruning is also mentioned as a means of keeping the lattice down to a tractable size.

One of the major bottlenecks in the process of engineering analysis by using the finite-element method-a design of the finite-element mesh-was a subject of improvement. Defining an appropriate geometric mesh model that ensures low approximation errors and avoids unnecessary computational overhead is a very difficult and time-consuming task based mainly on the user's experience. A knowledge base for finite-element mesh design has been constructed using the ML techniques. Ten mesh models have been used as a source of training examples. The mesh dataset was probably the first real-world relational dataset and became one of the most widely used training set for experimenting with inductive logic programming (ILP) systems. After several experiments with different ML systems in the last few years, the ILP system CLAUDIEN was chosen to construct the rules for determining the appropriate mesh resolution values. The ILP has been found to be an effective approach to the problem of mesh design. An evaluation of the resulting knowledge base shows that the mesh design patterns are captured well by the induced rules and represent a solid basis for practical application. The aim of this paper is not only to present the real-life ML application to design, but also to describe and discuss a relation of the work being done to the topic of this special issue: the proposed "dimensions" of ML in design.

Acquiring new cases is one possible way of learning in a case-based system. These cases comprise mainly success knowledge. The successful cases are essentially used to generate new design solutions. But a case-based system also can make use of failure knowledge. In this paper we present how a case-based system can acquire failure cases for verification of the solution created by success cases. We describe IM-RECIDE, a system that uses case-based reasoning for solving design problems that are imperfectly described and explained. The learning aspect is focused and some of the machine learning dimensions in design are criticized. Experimental results in the domain of room configuration also are presented.

Consequently, in this paper we present a set of dimensions for machine learning in design research.

J	Ivezic, N; Garrett, JH				Ivezic, N; Garrett, JH			Machine learning for simulation-based support of early collaborative design	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						collaborative design; constraint satisfaction; real-time decision support; simulations; statistical neural networks		The research and development of a simulation-based decision support system (SB-DSS) capable of assisting early collaborative design processes is presented. The requirements for such a system are included. Existing collaborative DSSs are shown to lack the capability to manipulate complex simulation-based relationships. On the other hand, advances within the machine learning in design community are shown to have a potential for providing, but have not yet addressed, simulation-based support for collaborative design processes. The developed SB-DSS is described in terms of its four principal components. First, the behavior-evaluation (BE) model is used to both structure individual, domain-specific decision models and organize these models into a collaborative decision model. Second, a probabilistic framework for the BE model enables management of the uncertainty inherent in learning and using simulation-based knowledge. Significantly, this framework provides a constraint satisfaction environment in which simulation-based knowledge is used. Third, a statistical neural network approach is used to capture simulation-based knowledge and build the probabilistic behavior models based on this knowledge. Fourth, since a probability distribution theory does not exist for the nonlinear neural network approaches, Monte Carlo simulation is introduced as a method to sample the trained neural networks and approximate the likelihoods of design variable values. Consequently, constraint satisfaction problem-solving capability is obtained. In addition, a mapping of the SB-DSS architecture onto a collaborative design agent framework is provided. Experimental evaluation of a prototype SB-DSS system is summarized, and performance of the SB-DSS with respect to search and usability metrics is documented. Initial results in developing the simulation-based support for collaborative design are encouraging. Lastly, a categorization of the machine learning approach and a critique of the proposed categorization scheme is presented.

The abstraction and generalization of design cases into hierarchical levels of abstractions provide the designer with the flexibility to apply any level of abstract and generalized knowledge for a new layout design problem. Existing case-based layout learning (CBLL) systems abstract and generalize cases into single levels of abstractions, but not into a hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a new approach, termed customized viewpoint-spatial (CV-S), which supports the generalization and abstraction of spatial layouts into hierarchies along with a supporting system, SPIDA (SPatial Intelligent Design Assistant).

J	Reich, Y				Reich, Y			Learning in design: From characterizing dimensions to working systems	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						design practice; human learning; machine learning; practical ML; propeller design	MACHINE; ACQUISITION; KNOWLEDGE	The application of machine learning (ML) to solve practical problems is complex. Only recently, due to the increased promise of ML in solving real problems and the experienced difficulty of their use, has this issue started to attract attention. This difficulty arises from the complexity of learning problems and the large variety of available techniques. In order to understand this complexity and begin to overcome it, it is important to construct a characterization of learning situations. Building on previous work that dealt with the practical use of ML, a set of dimensions is developed, contrasted with another recent proposal, and illustrated with a project on the development of a decision-support system for marine propeller design. The general research opportunities that emerge from the development of the dimensions are discussed. Leading toward working systems, a simple model is presented for setting priorities in research and in selecting learning tasks within large projects. Central to the development of the concepts discussed in this paper is their use in future projects and the recording of their successes, limitations, and failures.

J	Schwabacher, M; Ellman, T; Hirsh, H				Schwabacher, M; Ellman, T; Hirsh, H			Learning to set up numerical optimizations of engineering designs	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						case-based reasoning; decision tree induction; engineering design; numerical optimization; reformation		Gradient-based numerical optimization of complex engineering designs offers the promise of rapidly producing better designs. However, such methods generally assume that the objective function and constraint functions are continuous, smooth, and defined everywhere. Unfortunately, realistic simulators tend to violate these assumptions, making optimization unreliable. Several decisions that need to be made in setting up an optimization, such as the choice of a starting prototype and the choice of a formulation of the search space, can make a difference in the reliability of the optimization. Machine learning can improve gradient-based methods by making these choices based on the results of previous optimizations. This paper demonstrates this idea by using machine learning for four parts of the optimization setup problem: selecting a starting prototype from a database of prototypes, synthesizing a new starting prototype, predicting which design goals are achievable, and selecting a formulation of the search space. We use standard tree-induction algorithms (C4.5 and CART). We present results in two realistic engineering domains: racing yachts and supersonic aircraft. Our experimental results show that using inductive learning to make setup decisions improves both the speed and the reliability of design optimization.

A foundation for machine learning in design (MLinD) is defined so as to provide answers to basic questions on learning in design, such as, "What types of knowledge can be learnt?", "How does learning occur?", and "When does learning occur?". Five main elements of MLinD are presented as the input knowledge, knowledge transformers, output knowledge, goals/reasons for learning, and learning triggers. Using this foundation, published systems in MLinD were reviewed. The systematic review presents a basis for validating the presented foundation. The paper concludes that there is considerable work to be carried out in order to fully formalize the foundation of MLinD.

Most RL methods optimize the discounted total reward received by an agent, while, in many domains, the natural criterion is to optimize the average reward per time step. In this paper, we introduce a model-based Average-reward Reinforcement Learning method called H-learning and show that it converges more quickly and robustly than its discounted counterpart in the domain of scheduling a simulated Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV). We also introduce a version of H-learning that automatically explores the unexplored parts of the state space, while always choosing greedy actions with respect to the current value function. We show that this "Auto-exploratory H-Learning" performs better than the previously studied exploration strategies. To scale H-learning to larger state spaces, we extend it to learn action models and reward functions in the form of dynamic Bayesian networks, and approximate its value function using local linear regression. We show that both of these extensions are effective in significantly reducing the space requirement of H-learning and making it converge faster in some AGV scheduling tasks.

J	Epstein, SL				Epstein, SL			Pragmatic navigation: reactivity, heuristics, and search	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						AI architectures; heuristic search; machine learning; multistrategy learning; navigation; problem solving; satisfying; situation-based search; spatial representation	EXPERT PERFORMANCE; ACQUISITION; MODELS; TIME	FORR (FOr the Right Reasons) is an architecture for learning and problem solving that integrates a possibly incomplete and overlapping set of solution methods to address complex problems. Each method, although it represents some facet of domain expertise, may vary in reliability and speed. The principal contribution of this paper is the extension of FORR to include situation-based behavior (the serial testing of known, triggered techniques for problem solving in a domain) with reactivity and heuristic reasoning..FORR categorizes methods as reactive, heuristic, or situation-based, and addresses problem solving with one category of methods at a time. A hierarchical reasoner first has the opportunity to react correctly. If no ready reaction is computed, the reasoner activates a set of reactive triggers for time-limited search procedures tailored to specific situations. If they, too, fail to produce a response, the reasoner resorts to collaboration among heuristic rationales. All three components reference knowledge learned from experience. In a series of experiments, this architecture is shown to be effective and efficient. Ablation experiments demonstrate how each component plays an important role in problem solving. Additional contributions of this paper include a FORR-based, pragmatic, cognitively plausible approach to navigation with learned heuristic approximations that describe two-dimensional territory and travel experience through it, and a careful study of how situation-based behavior, reactivity, and heuristics interact there. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the resultant system is both effective and efficient, and guidelines for generalization to other domains are provided. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

COMPUTER NETWORKS AND ISDN SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International World Wide Web Conference	APR 14-18, 1998	BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA			search engines; machine learning	DECISION TREES	Search engines and indices were created to help people find information amongst the rapidly increasing number of World Wide Web (WWW) pages. The search engines automatically visit and index pages so that they can return good matches for their users' queries. The way that this indexing is done varies from engine to engine and the detail is usually secret although the strategy is sometimes made public in general terms. The search engines' aim is to return relevant pages quickly. On the other hand, the author of a Web page has a vested interest in it rating highly, for appropriate queries, on as many search engines as possible. Some authors have an interest in their page rating well for a great many types of query indeed - spamming has come to the Web. We treat modelling the workings of WWW search engines as an inductive inference problem. A training set of data is collected, being pages returned in response to typical, queries. Decision trees are used as the model class for the search engines' selection criteria although this is not to say that search engines actually contain decision trees. A machine learning program is used to infer a decision tree for each search engine, an information-theory criterion being used to direct the inference and to prevent over-fitting.

With the growth of the Internet and the expressiveness of multimedia, there are new possibilities for advertising and electronic shopping. To improve the acceptance of customers and to realize "new shopping fun" without annoyance, it seems necessary to develop a system that adapts the product presentation to the interest of the customers, their media preferences and the hardware and software preconditions. This paper introduces the TELLIM system which offers these features for multimedia presentations in the web by using an incremental learning algorithm. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Buluswar, SD; Draper, BA				Buluswar, SD; Draper, BA			Color machine vision for autonomous vehicles	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						color; autonomous vehicles; machine learning in computer vision	SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; CONSTANCY; SURFACES	Color can be a useful feature in autonomous vehicle systems that are based on machine vision, for tasks such as obstacle detection, lane/road following, and recognition of miscellaneous scene objects. Unfortunately, few existing autonomous vehicle systems use color to its full extent, largely because color-based recognition in outdoor scenes is complicated, and existing color machine-vision techniques have not been shown to be effective in realistic outdoor images. This paper presents a technique for achieving effective real-time color recognition in outdoor scenes. The technique uses multivariate decision trees for piecewise linear non-parametric function approximation to learn the color of a target object from training samples, and then detects targets by classifying pixels based on the approximated function. The method has been successfully tested in several domains, such as autonomous highway navigation, off-road navigation and target detection for unmanned military vehicles, in projects such as the U.S. National Automated Highway System (AHS) and the U.S. Defense Advanced Project Agency - Unmanned Ground Vehicle (DARPA-UGV). MDT-based systems have been used in stand-alone mode, as well as in conjunction with systems based on other sensor configurations. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Eklund, PW; Kirkby, SD; Salim, A				Eklund, PW; Kirkby, SD; Salim, A			Data mining and soil salinity analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article								The paper explores connections between decision support systems, remotely sensed and GIS data for environmental planning, and monitoring secondary soil salinization. The paper introduces a decision support knowledge base system called SALT MANAGER used as the starting point for three experiments in data mining which structure the paper. In the first, classified GIS data is passed to an inductive learning programme. The task is to reconstruct the classification rules. The resulting rules are used to improve knowledge base system performance. The second experiment reports on patterns of attribute value combinations occurring for specific classification classes. These patterns can be used to elicit new knowledge in the domain and lead to a form of knowledge discovery. This process is commonly referred to as 'data mining'. The third experiment measures the effect of an additional electromagnetic data layer on the knowledge base system. Again, our efforts yield novel knowledge discovery results from the application of data mining techniques.

A more objective assessment of altered motor control may be achieved by using a comprehensive protocol based on a surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity recorded from thigh and leg muscles. However, the relationship between the clinical and neurophysiological assessments is still unknown. In this paper we employ three different classification methods to investigate this relationship. The experimental results indicate that, if the appropriate set of sEMG features is used, the neurophysiological assessment is related to clinical findings and can be used to predict the AS. A comprehensive sEMG assessment may be proven useful as an objective method of evaluating the effectiveness of various interventions and for follow-up of SCI patients.

J	Hamdi, MS; Kaiser, K				Hamdi, MS; Kaiser, K			Adaptable arbitration of behaviours: some simulation results	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd World Congress on Intelligent Manufacturing Processes and Systems	JUN 10-13, 1997	BUDAPEST, HUNGARY			autonomous agents; behaviours; self-organization; machine learning		During the last few years, in an attempt to provide an efficient alternative to classical methods to designing robot control structures, the behaviour-based approach has emerged. Its success has largely been a result of the bottom-up development of a number of fast, tightly coupled control processes. This new approach, however, has some important limitations because of its lack of goal directedness and flexibility. This paper describes a self-improving control system that would deal with some of these problems. The system is based on two levels of arbitration, a local level which enables the robot to survive in a particular real-world situation, and a global level which ensures that the robot reactions be consistent with the required goal. Emphasis is put on the local arbitration level: it is shown how the local priorities can be computed and learnt and some simulation results are presented. (C) 1998 Chapman & Hall.

These goals can be attained and guaranteed in the planning departments of businesses through the sharing of secure and up-to-date planning data. leading to a high degree of flexibility and a minimum of interruptions in the production processes. In terms of technology planning, this results in a demand for economic methods of planning and NC programming, leading in turn to continuous, systematic acquisition of specialised in-house technological knowledge. However, most of the applications on the market are unsatisfactory in terms of acquisition of specialised knowledge of technology, only allowing specialised planning knowledge to be gathered or entered through costly procedures and for it to be organised statically. For rational processing and evaluation of planning knowledge, it is therefore sensible to systematically record technological discoveries made in the course of the planning and running-in process and to make them available for future planning processes. This processing of empirical knowledge along with rational and safe technology planning is supported by the use of DP systems, thus enabling planning knowledge to be kept constantly up-to-date, growing along with the data specific to the enterprise, Fur this purpose, a suitable information model must be devised that represents the integration point within the NC process chain. Using a feature-based product model introduced in the design departments as a starting point, the model is extended to take in a production-orientated view. The model should be designed in such a way that, above all, the technological interconnections are represented and that the technology planning, NC programming and running-in process are integrated through the model. In order to evaluate and process empirical knowledge? methods are applied from machine learning from Bayesian belief networks. This enables a costly human acquisition of the empirical knowledge of technology to be avoided and a rapid and rational decision-support system tailored to the particular problem to be developed. Also, by using suitable Bayesian belief networks, planning knowledge can be condensed; the numerous different planning conditions can be automatically diverted and the decision-base kept extremely up-to-date.

Incremental bootstrapping of neural network controllers was examined. The objective was twofold. First, to develop and evaluate the use of prewired or innate robot controllers to bootstrap backpropagation learning for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) controllers. Second, to develop and evaluate a new MLP controller trained on the back of another bootstrapped controller. The experimental hypothesis was that MLPs would improve on the performance of controllers used to train them. The performances of the innate and bootstrapped MLP controllers were compared in eight experiments on the tasks of avoiding obstacles and finding goals. Four quantitative measures were employed: the number of sensorimotor loops required to complete a task; the distance traveled; the: mean distance from walls and obstacles; the smoothness of travel. The overall pattern of results from statistical analyses of these quantities supported the hypothesis; the MLP controllers completed the tasks faster, smoother, and steered further from obstacles and walls than their innate teachers. In particular, a single MLP controller incrementally bootstrapped by a MLP subsumption controller was superior to the others.

J	Reid, DJ				Reid, DJ			Constructing Petri Net models using genetic search	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						classifier systems; genetic algorithms; genetic-based machine learning; nonlinear optimization; Petri Nets		The problem considered is that of constructing a Petri Net model of a particular device, process, or system described by observations of its interactions with its environment. The algorithm proposed for achieving a solution employs the principles of genetic search. Also presented is a detailed investigation of its operation, thereby affording a theoretical justification of its design. The expressive and representational power of Petri Nets renders them ideally suited to the modelling of many complex event systems. As a modelling language, they directly support the intrinsically difficult concepts of concurrent and parallel activities, synchronisation of events, and the distribution of various resources.: However, the development of a model of a significant system is laborious, and circumstances of limited knowledge of the system's internal structure compound the difficulty. By composing the perceived stimuli and responses of the system under study as a set of behavioural requirements, the Petri Net construction problem can be examined. The inherently difficult nature of this problem renders most other approaches inapplicable or inadequate; the quest for a satisfactory solution leads instead to the development of an algorithm employing genetic search technology. Built around a genetics-based machine learning architecture, the first algorithm developed shows a deficiency in its dependence on the particular order in which various options are explored; Alleviating this difficulty through a simple modification may also hold a lesson for other classifier systems.

This is accomplished by developing an intelligent Knowledge-Based Decision Support System for a contractor prequalification environment. The resulting DAI architecture comprises a hierarchy of loosely coupled problem solvers, all operating under the supervision of a top-level control mechanism. Each problem solver works as a classifier system. The problem-solving knowledge for each problem solver is developed using (1) machine learning by training neural networks, and (2) heuristic rules of thumb. A learning and refining subsystem is attached to the system for refining the existing knowledge to improve the system performance.

Specifically, the effect of incorporating Feature Construction in an existing adaptive learning-based decision support system is investigated. The primary purpose of constructing features is to increase the efficiency of obtaining information from available data by using new features in addition to the initial set of features. There is a need to obtain information effectively while scheduling an FFS.

J	Stone, P; Veloso, M				Stone, P; Veloso, M			Layered approach to learning client behaviors in the RoboCup soccer server	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								In the past few years, multiagent systems (MAS) have emerged as an active subfield of artificial intelligence (Al). Because of the inherent complexity of MAS, there is much interest in using machine learning (ML) techniques to help build multiagent learning. Our approach to using ML as a tool for building Soccer Server clients involves layering increasingly complex learned behaviors. In this article, we describe two levels of learned behaviors. First, the clients learn a low-level individual skill that allows them to control the ball effectively. Then, using this learning skill, they learn a higher level skill that involves multiple players. For both skills, we describe the learning method in detail and report on our extensive empirical testing. We also verify empirically that the learned skills are applicable to game situations.

J	Laurikkala, J; Juhola, M				Laurikkala, J; Juhola, M			A genetic-based machine learning system to discover the diagnostic rules for female urinary incontinence	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						genetics algorithms; genetic-based machine learning; machine learning; female urinary incontinence; medical expert systems; discriminant analysis	ALGORITHMS; PREVALENCE	A machine learning system named Galactica has been developed which uses a genetic algorithm to discover the rules for an expert system from databases. Galactica devised accurate diagnostic rules for female urinary incontinence from difficult heterogeneous data. The percentages of correctly classified stress, mixed and sensory urge incontinence testing cases were 89, 86 and 87%, respectively. However, these rules were rather general, consisting of 4-6 out of 13 conditions available in the data. Diagnostic rules for stress and mixed incontinence extracted from straightforward homogeneous data were highly accurate, classifying 100% of testing cases correctly as well as being specific, having from 10 to 11 conditions. More specific, but less accurate, rules were found from heterogeneous data with a biased fitness function. All of the rules were correct, i.e. every condition in the rules had the expected value specified by the expert. Although, Galactica achieved a slightly better classification than the discriminant analysis, it is argued that the genetic approach is better than the statistical one, due to symbolic rules being comprehensible, whereas understanding. a complex mathematical model requires statistical expertise.

Inductive learning methods are typically used to acquire general knowledge from examples. Lazy methods are those in which the experience is accessed, selected and used in a problem-centered way. In this paper we report important approaches to inductive learning methods such as propositional and relational learners, with an emphasis in Inductive Logic Programming based methods, as well as to lazy methods such as instance-based and case-based reasoning.

J	DeCoste, D				DeCoste, D			The significance of Kasparov versus DEEP BLUE and the future of computer chess	ICCA JOURNAL			English	Article							GAME-TREE SEARCH; ALGORITHM	In this paper we argue that the Garry Kasparov versus DEEP BLUE matches of 1996 and 1997, despite some shortcomings, have had a significant positive impact on computer-chess and artificial-intelligence research. Such matches can be viewed as valuable lessons in how (and how not) to use man-machine competitions to obtain a better focus on applied research and on the development efforts. One of the most important goals is to provide benchmarks (both in terms of development effort and match performance) that more knowledge-intensive (i.e., less brute-force) approaches must surpass to justify their extra complexity. We will briefly summarize some of the latest developments in computer-chess research and highlight how our work on a program called CHESTER tries to build on them to provide such justifications. Using our CHESTER work as an example, we propose a possible shift in emphasis for the computer-chess community: away from tournament performances (nowadays a short-term goal) and more toward treating the chess domain as a valuable testbed for research on emerging large-scale data-mining and machine-learning techniques. The successes of DEEP BLUE, despite legitimate questions of validity and scope, have in some sense freed (and perhaps even compelled) us to refocus on such longer-term goals.

Most previous work has only considered the refinement of the network's conditional probability parameters and has not addressed the issue of refining the network's structure. We tackle this problem by a machine learning approach based on a formalism known as the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle is well suited to this task since it can perform tradeoffs between the accuracy. simplicity, and closeness to the existent structure. Another salient feature of this refinement approach is the capability of refining a network structure using partially specified data. Moreover, a localization scheme is developed for efficient computation of the description lengths since direct evaluation involves exponential time resources.

J	Major, RL				Major, RL			A symbolic approach using feature construction capable of acquiring information/knowledge for building expert systems	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DECISION TREES	This paper illustrates a technique useful for developing a knowledge-base of information to use in an expert system. The proposed approach employs a popular machine-learning algorithm along with a method for forming a finite number of features or conjuncts of at most n primitive attributes. We illustrate our procedure by examining the qualitative information represented in a set of consumer survey responses typically used to create measures of consumer confidence. After proposing a premise related to certain assumptions implicit in current models used to develop a quantitative measure of consumer confidence, our results show the certain assumptions regarding the construction of a consumer confidence measure appear to be appropriate for the time period we examined. We also demonstrate how to use our approach to form certain demographic descriptions of consumers from the survey data. Researchers may use this procedure to develop a knowledge-base of information that is capable of being easily understood by humans. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We therefore characterised the in vitro proliferative influence on eight sarcoma cell lines of the platelet-derived growth factor, the insulin-like growth factor 1, triiodothyronine, the epidermal growth factor, the luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone, progesterone, gastrin and 17 beta-oestradiol. The influence of the different factors on the proliferation of sarcoma cell lines was measured by the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test. Two culture media were studied: (1) a nutritionally poor medium containing 2% of fetal calf serum and (2) a nutritionally rich one containing 5% or 10% FCS both with and without the addition of non-essential amino acids. The results were analysed either by conventional statistical analyses or by a classification method based on a decision-tree approach developed in Machine Learning. This latter method was also compared to other classifiers (such as logistic regression and k nearest neighbours) with respect to its accuracy of classification. Monovariate statistical analysis showed that each of the eight cell lines exhibited sensitivity to at least one factor, and each factor significantly modified the proliferation of five or six of the eight cell lines under study. Of these eight lines one of fibrosarcoma origin was the most "factor-sensitive". Decision-tree-related data analysis enabled the specific pattern of factor sensitivity to be characterised for the three histological types of cell line under study. The effects of hormone and growth factors are significantly influenced by the type of culture medium used. The method used appeared to be an accurate classifier for the kind of data analysed. Sarcoma proliferation can be modulated, at least in vitro, by various hormones and growth factors, and the proliferation of each histopathological type exhibited a distinct sensitivity to different hormone and/or growth-factors.

J	Abdel-Aal, RE				Abdel-Aal, RE			Automatic fitting of Gaussian peaks using abductive machine learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						abductive networks; learning systems; peak fitting; spectral analysis; spectroscopy	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA; TEMPERATURE	Analytical techniques have been used for many years for fitting Gaussian peaks in nuclear spectroscopy, However, the complexity of the approach warrants looking for machine-learning alternatives where intensive computations are required only once (during training), while actual analysis on individual spectra is greatly simplified and quickened, This should allow the use of simple portable systems-for fast and automated analysis of large numbers of spectra, particularly in situations where accuracy may be traded for speed and simplicity, This paper proposes the use of abductive networks machine learning for this purpose, The Abductory Induction Mechanism (AIM)(1) tool was used to build models for analyzing both single and double Gaussian peaks in the presence of noise depicting statistical uncertainties in collected spectra, AIM networks were synthesized by training on 1000 representative simulated spectra and evaluated on 500 new spectra, A classifier network determines the multiplicity of single/double peaks with an accuracy of 98%, With statistical uncertainties corresponding to a peak count of 100, average percentage absolute errors for the height, position, and width of single peaks are 4.9, 2.9, and 4.2%, respectively, For double peaks, these average errors are within 7.0, 3.1, and 5.9 %, respectively. Models have been developed which account for the effect of a linear background on a single peak, Performance is compared with a neural network application and with an analytical curve-fitting routine, and the new technique is applied to actual data of an alpha spectrum.

An optimization procedure, combining a genetic algorithm and a power system dynamic simulator, generates the appropriate sequence of operations for each state of the power system. A machine learning technique (induction of decision trees) is applied to extract decision criteria that will guide the load restoration after a generalized black-out. The paper also presents the results of applying these techniques to a power system of realistic size. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Street, WN; Mangasarian, OL				Street, WN; Mangasarian, OL			Improved generalization via tolerant training	JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						inductive learning; function approximation; generalization	BREAST-CANCER; BIAS; AIR	Theoretical and computational justification is given for improved generalization when the training set is learned with less accuracy. The model used for this investigation is a simple linear one. It is shown that learning a training set with a tolerance tau improves generalization, over zero-tolerance training, for any testing set satisfying a certain closeness condition to the training set. These results, obtained via a mathematical programming formulation, are placed in the context of some well-known machine learning results. Computational confirmation of improved generalization is given for linear systems (including nine of the twelve real-world data sets tested), as well as for nonlinear systems such as neural networks for which no theoretical results are available at present. In particular, the tolerant training method improves generalization on noisy, sparse, and overparameterized problems.

To this aim, we analyze and summarize the lessons learned from applying Machine Learning techniques to a variety of problems. We believe that these lessons, though primarily based on our personal experience, can be generalized to a wider range of situations and are supported by the reported experiences of other researchers.

We describe the development of JARtool, a trainable software system that learns to recognize volcanoes in a large data set of Venusian imagery. A machine learning approach is used because it is much easier for geologists to identify examples of volcanoes in the imagery than it is to specify domain knowledge as a set of pixel-level constraints. This approach can also provide portability to other domains without the need for explicit reprogramming; the user simply supplies the system with a new set of training examples. We show how the development of such a system requires a completely different set of skills than are required for applying machine learning to "toy world" domains. This paper discusses important aspects of the application process not commonly encountered in the "toy world" including obtaining labeled training data, the difficulties of working with pixel data, and the automatic extraction of higher-level features.

We use our particular case study to illustrate such issues as problem formulation, selection of evaluation measures, and data preparation. We relate these issues to properties of the oil spill application, such as its imbalanced class distribution, that are shown to be common to many applications. Our solutions to these issues are implemented in the Canadian Environmental Hazards Detection System (CEHDS), which is about to undergo field testing.

J	Finn, P; Muggleton, S; Page, D; Srinivasan, A				Finn, P; Muggleton, S; Page, D; Srinivasan, A			Pharmacophore discovery using the Inductive Logic Programming system PROGOL	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						inductive logic programming; pharmacophore; structure-activity prediction	CONVERTING ENZYME-INHIBITORS; DRUG DESIGN; IDENTIFICATION; COMPASS	This paper presents a case study of a machine-aided knowledge discovery process within the general area of drug design. Within drug design, the particular problem of pharmacophore discovery is isolated, and the Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system PROGOL is applied to the problem of identifying potential pharmacophores for ACE inhibition. The case study reported in this paper supports four general lessons for machine learning and knowledge discovery, as well as more specific lessons for pharmacophore discovery, for Inductive Logic Programming, and for ACE inhibition. The general lessons for machine learning and knowledge discovery are as follows. 1. An initial rediscovery step is a useful tool when approaching a new application domain. 2. General machine learning heuristics may fail to match the derails of an application domain, but it may be possible to successfully apply a heuristic-based algorithm in spite of the mismatch. 3. A complete search for all plausible hypotheses can provide useful information to a user, although experimentation may be required to choose between competing hypotheses. 4. A declarative knowledge representation facilitates the development and debugging of background knowledge in collaboration with a domain expert, as well as the communication of final results.

J	Bax, E				Bax, E			Validation of average error rate over classifiers	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						machine learning; Vapnik-Chervonenkis; validation		We examine methods to estimate the average and variance of test error rates over a set of classifiers. We begin with the process of drawing a classifier at random for each example. Given validation data, the average test error rate can be estimated as if validating a single classifier. Given the test example inputs, the variance tan be computed exactly. Next, we consider the process of drawing a classifier at random and using it on all examples. Once again, the expected test error rate can be validated as if validating a single classifier. However, the variance must be estimated by validating all classifiers, which yields loose or uncertain bounds. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the work described, machine learning methods were applied to the problem of recognising level night conditions (i.e. from hover to high-speed forward flight). The approach taken was to use an absolute minimum of information; in this case, analysing the data obtained from a single, airframe-mounted strain gauge. The results revealed that flight condition recognition was possible with this minimalist approach, but that more work needs to be done to decrease the error rates, thereby increasing the recognition reliability.

In this paper, we describe more sophisticated learning techniques that are different in abstraction level. We evaluate our method on a set of images from the non-destructive testing domain and show the feasibility of the approach. As result, we can show that conventional image processing methods combined with machine learning techniques form a powerful tool for image interpretation.

Research on machine learning has concentrated in the main on inducing rules from unordered sets of examples. The general principle of induction says that things in the future will behave as they have in the past. The ability to learn must be part of any system that claims to possess general intelligence. Learning can be defined as: any change in a system that allows it to improve its performance in future situations. Since learning involves changes in the learner, it cannot occur without some means to represent the learned knowledge. However, the exact nature of those changes and the best way to represent them are far from obvious. In this paper, we will present a possible probabilistic representation.

The linear response correction to the correlations is given by the Hessian of the Gibbs free energy. The computational complexity of the algorithm is cubic in the number of neurons. We compare the performance of the exact BM learning algorithm with first order (Weiss) mean field theory and second order (TAP) mean field theory. The learning task consists of a fully connected Ising spin glass model on 10 neurons. We conclude that 1) the method works well for paramagnetic problems 2) the TAP correction gives a significant improvement over the Weiss mean field theory, both for paramagnetic and spin glass problems and 3) that the inclusion of diagonal weights improves the Weiss approximation for paramagnetic problems, but not for spin glass problems.

A plug in classification technique (PaCT) is a method that takes a standard classifier (such as LDA or TREES) and plugs it into an algorithm to produce a new classifier. The standard classifier is known as the Plug in Classifier (PiC). These methods often produce large improvements over using a single classifier. In this paper we investigate one of these methods and give some motivation for its success.

A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5]. It has been applied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems using rather simple learning algorithms [4], and decision trees [1, 2, 6]. In this paper we use AdaBoost to improve the performances of neural networks. We compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. Our system achieves about 1.4% error on a data base of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. Adaptive boosting of a multi-layer network achieved 1.5% error on the UCI Letters and 8.1% error on the UCI satellite data set.

We present a machine learning model, the monotonic network, for which monotonicity can be enforced exactly, i.e., by virtue of functional form. A straightforward method for implementing and training a monotonic network is described. Monotonic networks are proven to be universal approximators of continuous, differentiable monotonic functions. We apply monotonic networks to a real-world task in corporate bond rating prediction and compare them to other approaches.

Here, to avoid this, we apply a novel methodology centred on re-inforcement learning (RL) whereby, unlike most forms of machine learning, an autonomous agent is not instructed on how to act by example but instead learns directly by trying control actions and seeking for those giving maximum reward. A central notion is the performance or value function that, in a given current state, signifies the contribution a specific action will make towards maximising the final performance or reward over an entire batch. For batch-to-batch, incremental learning and control, the initially unknown value function is here represented using wire fitting and a neural network. This is a simple yet powerful means of simultaneously learning and fitting the value function. The performance achieved in each completed batch can be propagated from the end point back through the intermediate states. With echoes of dynamic programming, this allows calculation of Bellman's errors which can be minimised in fitting. The higher level optimisation and control problem in batch processing thus fits neatly into this framework and some results of a case study illustrate the potential of the approach.

J	Fuchs, M; Fuchs, M				Fuchs, M; Fuchs, M			Feature-based learning of search-guiding heuristics for theorem proving	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						theorem proving; search heuristics; machine learning		Automated reasoning or theorem proving essentially amounts to solving search problems. Despite significant progress in recent years theorem provers still have many shortcomings. The use of machine-learning techniques is acknowledged as promising, but difficult to apply in the area of theorem proving. We propose here to learn search-guiding heuristics by employing features in a simple, yet effective manner. Features are used to adapt a heuristic to a solved source problem. The adapted heuristic can then be utilized profitably for solving related target problems. Experiments have demonstrated that the approach allows a theorem prover to prove hard problems that were out of reach before.

The main key of the feature evaluation is to consider the effects of an increasing number of features in the integrated system. The research is concerned with the development of texture feature extraction methods in texture classification and the integration of machine learning and computer vision systems. The feature extraction methods include Markov random fields, co-occurrence matrices, and moments, convolutions, and neighboring. Total of 25 texture features is extracted by these methods for the experimentation. The machine learning method used in this research is an AQ15 method for inductive concept learning from examples. The integrated system consists of image preprocessing, feature extraction, classification (AQ15), and feature selection modules. The paper presents 1) what are good selected features by evaluating the performance of the classification system when the number of features are increasing, 2) whether coefficients (features) of the Markov Random Fields are suitable for the texture classification by comparing them with the already selected features.

J	Bioch, JC				Bioch, JC			Dualization, decision lists and identification of monotone discrete functions	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							COMPLEXITY	Many data-analysis algorithms in machine learning, datamining and a variety of other disciplines essentially operate on discrete multi-attribute data sets. By means of discretisation or binarization also numerical data sets can be successfully analysed. Therefore, in this paper we view/introduce the theory of (partially defined) discrete functions as an important theoretical tool for the analysis of multi-attribute data sets. In particular we study monotone (partially defined) discrete functions. Compared with the theory of Boolean functions relatively little is known about (partially defined) monotone discrete functions. It appears that decision lists are useful for the representation of monotone discrete functions. Since dualization is an important tool in the theory of (monotone) Boolean functions, we study the interpretation and properties of the dual of a (monotone) binary or discrete function. We also introduce the dual of a pseudo-Boolean function. The results are used to investigate extensions of partially defined monotone discrete functions and the identification of monotone discrete functions. In particular, we present a polynomial time algorithm for the identification of so-called stable discrete functions.

J	Ishizaka, H; Arimura, H; Shinohara, T				Ishizaka, H; Arimura, H; Shinohara, T			Finding tree patterns consistent with positive and negative examples using queries	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								This paper is concerned with the problem of finding a hypothesis in TP2 consistent with given positive and negative examples. The hypothesis class TP2 consists of all sets of at most two tree patterns and represents the class of unions of at most two tree pattern languages. Especially, we consider the problem from the point of view of the consistency problem for TP2. The consistency problem is a problem for deciding whether there exists a consistent hypothesis with given positive and negative examples within some fixed hypothesis space. Efficient solvability of that problem is closely related to the possibility of efficient machine learning or machine discovery. Unfortunately, however, the consistency problem is known to be NP-complete for many hypothesis spaces. In this paper, the problem for the class TP2 is also shown to be NP-complete. In order to overcome this computational hardness, we try to use additional information obtained by making queries. First, we give an algorithm that, using restricted subset queries, solves the consistency problem for TP2 in time polynomial in the total size of given positive and negative examples. Next, we show that each subset query made by the algorithm can be replaced by several membership queries under some condition on a set of function symbols. As a result, we have that the consistency problem for TP2 is solved in polynomial time using membership queries.

In Thai, as words are written consecutively without delimiters, finding unknown word boundary is difficult. We proposed a feature-based approach to identify Thai unknown word boundary. A feature can be anything that tests for specific information in context around the target unknown words. To automatically extract features from a training corpus, we used a machine learning algorithm, namely Winnow.

The PCFE extracts features from a subset of principal curves computed via the principal components of the input data. With its flexible partitioning choice and non-parametric nature, the PCFE is capable of modeling nonlinear data effectively The PCC is a general non-paramatric classification method that involves computing principal curve template for each class during the training phase. In the test or application phase, an unlabeled data point is assigned the class label of the nearest principal curve template. PCC performs well for non-gaussian distributed data and data with low local instrinsic dimensionality. Experiments comparing the PCC to established classification methods are performed on selected benchmarks from the UC Irvine machine learning database and the PROBEN1 benchmark dataset, to highlight situations where PCC is advantageous for feature extraction, data characterization, and classification.

Algorithms are developed for a simulated mobile robot that uses an array of range finders for navigation. Navigation algorithms are tested in a variety of differently shaped environments to encourage the development of robust solutions, and reduce the possibility of solutions based on memorization of a fixed set of movements. A brief introduction to CP is presented. A typical wall-following robot evolutionary cycle is analyzed, and results are presented. GP is shown to be capable of producing robust wall-following navigation algorithms that perform well in each of the test environments used.

The proposed algorithm has the characteristics of learning new knowledge of samples in serials, which is referred to as serial machine learning algorithm (SMLA). SMLA realizes incremental version of learning by limits the weight adjustment under a valid boundary. The algorithm can make new knowledge be learned effectively without the old knowledge being stored and re-processed. The advantage of SMLA is that it can expand the knowledge of the system, improve its intelligence and gradually enhance its adaptability. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

Although nearest-neighbor classification algorithms have emerged as a promising approach to machine learning tasks with their high predictive accuracy, they are adversely affected by the presence of such irrelevant features. In this paper, we describe a recently proposed classification algorithm called VFI5, which achieves comparable accuracy to nearest-neighbor classifiers while it is robust with respect to irrelevant features. The paper compares both the nearest-neighbor classifier and the VFI5 algorithms in: the presence of irrelevant features on both artificially generated and real-world data sets selected from the UCI repository.

The approach stems from the natural idea (formally studied within the lattice theory) to estimate the Similarity between two objects in a hierarchical structure by the distances to their closest common parent. The hierarchies used are the subsumption lattices induced by the generalization operations (e.g. lgg) commonly used in inductive learning. Using some basic results from the theory the paper shows how the corresponding ML techniques can be combined and extended in order to define a unified framework for solving some of the basic inductive learning tasks: An algorithm for this purpose is proposed and its performance is illustrated by examples.

This paper describes new learning rules for the ART2 neural network model of category learning that facilitates forgetting without additional node;features or subsystems and which preserves the main characteristics of the classic ART2 model. We consider that this approach is straightforward and is arguably biological plausible. The new learning rules drop the-specification within the classic ART2 model that learning should only occur at the winning node. Classic ART2 learning rules are presented as a particular case of these new rules. The model increases system adaptability to continually changing or complex input domains. This allows the system to maintain information in a manner which is consistent with its use and allows system resources to be dynamically allocated in away that is consistent with observations made of biological learning.

In this study, a number of datasets were solicited from agricultural researchers and processed using a machine learning workbench. The results were reported to the researchers, and then interviews were conducted with some of them to determine their perceptions about the use of machine learning as an additional analysis technique to traditional statistical analysis. A number of themes about their satisfaction with this technique were constructed from the interview transcripts, which generally indicate that machine learning may be able to contribute to analysis and understanding of these kinds of datasets.

A vast array of networks services is growing up around the Internet and massive amounts of information is added everyday. Users can now access massive amounts of information in various forms, thereby creating an equally massive problem. This rapid growth in data volume, user base, and data diversity render Internet-accessible information increasingly difficult to be used effectively. Therefore, search for a specific information on this massive and exploding Internet information resource base becomes highly critical. In this paper we discuss the issues involved in the application of machine learning techniques To the problem of Internet-based information overload. We present a general architecture and describe how it has been instantiated in a functional system we developed. The system attempts to concurrently maximize and optimize the resource/knowledge discovery, and custimize the information to individual users. We discuss the design issues involved in the attempt to develop an evolvable architecture which can easily and inexpensively accommodate future generations of web-based systems and technologies.

Incremental bootstrapping of neural network controllers was examined. The objective was twofold. First, to develop and evaluate the use of prewired or innate robot controllers to bootstrap backpropagation learning for Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) controllers. Second, to develop and evaluate a new MLP controller trained on the back of another bootstrapped controller. The experimental hypothesis was that MLPs would improve on the performance of controllers used to train them. The performances of the innate and bootstrapped MLP controllers were compared in eight experiments on the tasks of avoiding obstacles and finding goals. Four quantitative measures were employed: the number of sensorimotor loops required to complete a task; the distance traveled; the mean distance from walls and obstacles; the smoothness of travel. The overall pattern of results from statistical analyses of these quantities supported the hypothesis; the MLP controllers completed the tasks faster, smoother, and steered further from obstacles and walls than their innate teachers. In particular, a single MLP controller incrementally bootstrapped by a MLP subsumption controller was superior to the others.

J	Mirkin, B				Mirkin, B			Least-squares structuring, clustering and data processing issues	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article							MODELS	Approximation structuring clustering is an extension of what is usually called 'square-error clustering' onto various cluster structures and data formats. It appears to be not only a mathematical device to support, specify and extend many clustering techniques, but also a framework for mathematical analysis of interrelations among the techniques and their relations to other concepts and problems in data analysis, statistics, machine learning, data compression and decompression and the design and use of multiresolution hierarchies. Eased on the results found, a number of methods for solving data processing problems are described.

The learning algorithm addresses the knowledge acquisition problem by developing and maintaining the knowledge base through instance based inductive learning. The performance of the learning system is discussed in terms of the knowledge extracted from example cases and its classification accuracy on the test cases. Results indicate that the introduced system is a promising alternative to neural networks for fault diagnosis and a complement to expert systems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The system can self-generate rules to correctly diagnose obstructions in the three main arteries, namely right coronary artery(RCA), left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (CCX), or a patient being normal (with no obstructed arteries). The rule formation engine is based on the CLIP3 (Cover Learning using Integer Programming version 3) machine learning algorithm. The system stares all data (training data, fuzzy sets and rules) into a relational database. The primary consideration of our design was to keep the system easy to use, thus the database operations are transparent to the user. The architecture of the system is a multithreaded structure that allows multiple operations to be carried out in parallel. The biggest advantage of the system is that a diagnosis can be carried out over the Internet via HTML forms.

In practice, the user of a data mining tool is interested in accuracy, efficiency, and comprehensibility for a specific domain which may be reached through feature selection. In this work we use the wrapper approach for Feature Subset Selection. The FSS algorithm from MLC++ library was used to run experiments with datasets containing many features. Accuracies for five inducers using all features, features found by FSS as well as the union of all those selected features are presented. Results confirm the superiority of FSS wrapper approach but in some cases the computational cost is excessive.

In this case, one of the great problem faced is to have databases with good quality data, and principally, with a sufficient amount of data to base the work of learning algorithms upon. Today, the amount of data is not the problem anymore; in contrast, many organizations now have a wide range and quantity of information stored in large databases. They are so large and without consistent modeling that gives support to that dimensionality, the first stage of the Machine Learning process is now a specific step. This step is the "search" into the databases, of relationships between the data and concepts stored to guide the whole process, and it is now discussed and used throughout the world and known as data-mining. Despite the problems inherited by the learning algorithms used and the existing databases, the necessity of storing and treating the unstructured information and sharing information - by distributed processing or accessing the global network - have brought new problems to be addressed, principally in the areas of Data Bases and Artificial Intelligence, to make possible the execution of data-mining task. The Multi-Agent System view, like a development paradigm of new generation computational systems, emerges as a promising technology to solve many of these problems.

The projections are designed to approximately preserve interclass distances. Data sets that have been extensively studied in the machine learning and statistical pattern recognition communities are analyzed in the projected space using standard statistical techniques. A simple implementation involving no pre-processing or data dependent adjustments produced results that are near-competitive with the best known established classification rates on these benchmark data sets. Thus even in moderate dimensional spaces the utility and robustness of classification schemes based on these projections is demonstrated.

We describe a paleoecological reconstruction problem where Bayesian methods are useful and allow plausible inferences from the small and vague data sets available. Paleoecological reconstruction aims at estimating temperatures in the past. Knowledge about present day abundances of certain species are combined with data about the same species in fossil assemblages (e.g., lake sediments). Stated formally, the reconstruction task has the form of a typical machine learning problem. However, to obtain useful predictions, a lot of background knowledge about ecological variation is needed. In paleoecological literature the statistical methods are involved variations of regression. We compare these methods with regression trees, nearest neighbor methods, and Bayesian hierarchical models. All the methods achieve about the same prediction accuracy on modern specimens, but the Bayesian methods and the involved regression methods seem to yield the best reconstructions. The advantage of the Bayesian methods is that they also give good estimates on the variability of the reconstructions.

Some researchers have attempted to understand learning algorithms by experimenting them on a variety of domains. Others have presented theoretical methods of learning algorithm by using approximately mathematical model. The mathematical model has some deficiency that, if the model is too simplified, it may lose the essential behavior of the original algorithm. Furthermore, experimental analyses are based only on informal analyses of the learning task, whereas theoretical analyses address the worst case. Therefore, the results of theoretical analyses are quite different from empirical results. In our framework, called random case analysis, we adopt the idea of randomized algorithms. By using random case analysis, it can predict various aspects of learning algorithm's behavior, and require less computational time than the other theoretical analyses. Furthermore, we can easily apply our framework to practical learning algorithms.

In this paper, we focus on a particular situation where we assume that the hypothesis we want to use for prediction is a very simple one so the hypotheses class is of feasible size. We study the problem of how to determine which of the hypotheses in the class is almost the best one. We present two on-line sampling algorithms for selecting a hypothesis, give theoretical bounds on the number of examples needed, and analyze them experimentally. We compare them with the simple batch sampling approach commonly used and show that in most of the situations our algorithms use a much smlaler number of examples.

Approaches can be broadly divided by distinguishing discovery of procedural from that of declarative knowledge. Client requirements determine which of these is appropriate. This paper discusses an experimental application of machine learning in an area related to drug design. The bottleneck here is in finding appropriate constraints to reduce the large number of candidate molecules to be synthesised and tested. Such constraints can be viewed as declarative specifications of the structural elements necessary for high medicinal activity and low toxicity. The first-order representation used within Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) provides an appropriate description language for such constraints. Within this application area knowledge accreditation requires not only a demonstration of predictive accuracy but also, and crucially, a certification of novel insight into the structural chemistry. This paper describes an experiment in which the ILP system Progol was used to obtain structural constraints associated with mutagenicity of molecules. In doing so Progol found a new indicator of mutagenicity within a subset of previously published data. This subset was already known not to be amenable to statistical regression, though its complement was adequately explained by a linear model. According to the combined accuracy/explanation criterion provided in this paper, on both subsets comparative trials show that Progol's structurally-oriented hypotheses are preferable to those of other machine learning algorithms.

However, although almost a third of a billion people worldwide, in several different languages, use Arabic characters for writing, little research progress, in both on-line and off-line has been achieved towards the automatic recognition of Arabic characters. This is a result of the lack of adequate support in terms of funding, and other utilities such as Arabic text database, dictionaries, etc.. and of course of the cursive nature of its writing rules. The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of Arabic printed text using machine learning C4.5. Symbolic machine learning algorithms are designed to accept, example descriptions in the form of feature vactors which include a lable that identifies the class to which an example belongs. The output of the algorithm is a set of rules that classifies unseen examples based on generalisations from the training set. This ability to generalise is the maine attraction of machine learning for handwriting recognition. Samples of a character can be preprocessed into a feature vector representation for presentation to a machine learning algorithm that creates rules for recognising characters of the same class. Symbolic machine learning has several advantages over other learning methods. It is fast in training and in recognition, generalises well, is noise tollerant and the symbolic representation is east to understand. The technique can be divided into three major steps: The first step is pre-processing in which the original image is transformed into a binary image utilizing a 300 dpi scanner and then forming the connected component. Second, global features of the input Arabic word are then extracted such as number subwords, number of peaks within the subword,, number and position of the complementary character, etc.. Finally, Machine learning C4.5 is used for character classification to generate a decision tree.

Indeed, in real-world domains, data are often inconsistent or contain numerical features which are difficult to handle, especially in symbolic approaches to Machine Learning such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). In this paper, a learning approach is proposed in order to cope with the two previous difficulties, in the context of ILP. In order to reduce the size of the data, this approach, based on Rough Set Theory, proposes to perform learning only on well-chosen portions of data which represent approximations of the concepts to learn. A first experimentation, conducted on a symbolic dataset related to a problem of document understanding, shows that the reduction of the data leads a gain of learning time. On the other hand, the coupling of Rough Set Theory and Fuzzy Set Theory allows for handling numerical features, as well as controlling the granularity of the data. A second experimentation, conducted on a hybrid dataset related to a classical problem of organic chemistry, shows the interest of the approach for dealing with both symbolic and numerical data. In addition, it puts into evidence the effects of varying the granularity of the information on the accuracy of the learning results.

However, this makes sense only if all errors have equal (uniform) costs. When the costs of errors differ between each other, the classifiers should be evaluated by comparing the total costs of the errors. Classifiers are typically designed to minimize the number of errors (incorrect classifications) made. When misclassification costs vary between classes, this approach is not suitable. In this case the total misclassification cost should be minimized. In Machine Learning, only little work for dealing with nonuniform misclassification costs has been done. This paper presents a few different approaches for cost-sensitive modifications of the backpropagation learning algorithm for multilayered feedforward neural networks. The described approaches are thoroughly tested and evaluated on several standard benchmark domains.

Machine learning techniques developed for learning on text data are used here on the hierarchical classification structure. The high number of features is reduced by taking into account the hierarchical structure and using feature subset selection based on the method known from information retrieval. Documents are represented as feature-vectors that include n-grams instead of including only single words (unigrams) as commonly used when learning on text data. Based on the hierarchical structure the problem is divided into subproblems, each representing one on the categories included in the Yahoo hierarchy. The result of learning is a set of independent classifiers, each used to predict the probability that a new example is a member of the corresponding category. Experimental evaluation on real-world data shows that the proposed approach gives good results.

We first review a simple probabilistic technique known as the Bayesian independence classifier approach. After identifying its shortcomings, we introduce a new approach based on Bayesian network induction and automatic discretization. Three different discretization techniques are explored. A series of experiments on a set of topics were conducted on a large-scale real-world document corpus. The empirical results demonstrate that our Bayesian network induction with advanced discretization achieves better performance.

B	Muggleton, S		Prade, H		Muggleton, S			Inductive Logic Programming: issues, results and the LLL challenge	ECAI 1998: 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	13TH European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 98)	AUG 23-28, 1998	BRIGHTON, ENGLAND	European Coordinating Comm Artifical Intelligence, Univ Brighton, Soc Study Artificial Intelligence & Simulat Behav, Univ Sussex, Soc Study Artificial Intelligence & Simulat Behav				Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) [9, 11] is the area of Al which deals with the induction of hypothesised predicate definitions from examples and background knowledge. Logic programs are used as a single representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. ILP is differentiated from most other forms of Machine Learning (ML) both by its use of an expressive representation language and its ability to make use of logically encoded background knowledge. This has allowed successful applications of ILP [1] in areas such as molecular biology [12, 10, 6, 5] and natural language [7, 3, 2] which both have rich sources of background knowledge and both benefit from the use of an expressive concept representation languages. For instance, the ILP system Progol has recently been used to generate comprehensible descriptions of the 23 most populated fold classes of proteins [14], where no such descriptions had previously been formulated manually. In the natural language area ILP has not only been shown to have higher accuracies than various other ML approaches in learning the past tense of English [8] but also shown to be capable of learning accurate gram mars which translate sentences into deductive database queries [15]. In both cases, follow up studies [13, 4] have shown that these ILP approaches to natural language problems extend with relative ease to various languages other than English. The area of Learning Language in Logic (LLL) is producing a number of challenges to existing ILP theory and implementations. In particular, language applications of ILP require revision and extension of a hierarchically defined set of predicates in which the examples are typically only provided for predicates at the top of the hierarchy. New predicates often need to be invented, and complex recursion is usually involved. Similarly the term structure of semantic objects is far more complex than in other applications of ILP. Advances in ILP theory and implementation related to the challenges of LLL are already producing beneficial advances in other sequence-oriented applications of ILP. In addition LLL is starting to develop its own character as a sub-discipline of Al involving the confluence of computational linguistics, machine learning and logic programming.

Today, the only way to do this is to build specialized applications, which are time-consuming to develop and difficult to maintain. We are addressing this problem by creating the technology and tools for rapidly constructing information agents that extract, query, and integrate data from web sources. Our approach is based on a simple, uniform representation that makes it efficient to integrate multiple sources. Instead of building specialized algorithms for handling web sources, we have developed methods for mapping web sources into this uniform representation. This approach builds on work from knowledge representation, machine learning and automated planning. The resulting system, called Ariadne, makes it fast and cheap to build new information agents that access existing web sources. Ariadne also makes it easy to maintain these agents and incorporate new sources as they become available.

Despite significant progress in recent years theorem provers still have many shortcomings. The use of machine-learning techniques is acknowledged as promising, but difficult to apply in the area of theorem proving. We propose here to learn search-guiding heuristics by employing features in a simple, yet effective manner. Features are used to adapt a heuristic to a solved source problem. The adapted heuristic can then be utilized profitably for solving related target problems. Experiments have demonstrated that the approach not only allows for significant speed-ups, but also makes it possible to prove problems that were out of reach before.

The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable world wide knowledge base whose content mirrors that. of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs: an ontology defining the classes and relations of interest, and a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext representing instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system.

We show how information extraction can be cast as a standard machine learning problem, and argue for the suitability of relational learning in solving it. The implementation of a general-purpose relational learner for information extraction, SRV, is described. In contrast with earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about document structure and the kinds of information available for use in learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural and other information is supplied as input in the form of an extensible token-oriented feature set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by adapting SRV for use in learning extraction rules for a domain consisting of university course and research project pages sampled from the Web. Making SRV Web-ready only involves adding several simple HTML-specific features to its basic feature set.

In IJCAI '97, we challenged the AI community to address this problem by creating adaptive web sites: sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation by mining visitor access data collected in Web server logs. In this paper we introduce our own approach to this broad challenge. Specifically, we investigate the problem of index page synthesis - the automatic creation of pages that facilitate a visitor's navigation of a Web site. First, are formalize this problem as a clustering problem and introduce a novel approach to clustering, which we call cluster mining: Instead of attempting to partition the entire data space into disjoint clusters, we search for a small number of cohesive (and possibly overlapping) clusters. Next, we present PageGather, a cluster mining algorithm that takes Web server logs as input and outputs the contents of candidate index pages. Finally, we show experimentally that PageGather is both faster (by a factor of three) and more effective than traditional clustering algorithms on this task. Our experiment relies on access logs collected over a month from an actual web site.

Each of the methods makes a priori assumptions, which it employs, given the data, when searching for its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space that is as rich as the space of oil linear separators. We use this to build an argument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear separator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a specific problem. We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators, utilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety of ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large number of attributes. In particular, we present an extensive experimental comparison of our approach with other methods on several well studied lexical disambiguation tasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction, prepositional phrase attachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show that our approach either outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs comparably to the best.

We have identified three types of temporal information, namely: duration, rate of change, and sequence of application of laboratory operators that are useful to learn from experimental data. Our motivation stems from study of experiment design in the domain of macromolecular crystallography [18]. In this paper, as identify the challenges posed both by the domain as well as the temporal information on machine learning learning programs, and describe work in progress. We outline our method of temporal specialization for inducing temporal relations between experimental variables, and illustrate with an example from the domain.

Some biases, such as the type of concepts that can be learnt, may be implicit in the machine learning technique. Other biases toward the predicted outcome may be implicit in the selection of the data, or explicitly available in the program. Decision tree heuristics, as with neural networks, are propositional learners, but with a slightly more restricted mapping. Decision tree heuristics can allow specific biases towards specific outcomes. The techniques for applying these biases are described and it is shown that more appropriate trees can be formed with these biases.

For the purpose of comparison, we included in our evaluation a handcrafted linear classifier, which is the selection heuristic currently used in the building detection system. ROC analysis showed that, when generalizing to unseen images that differed in location and aspect, a naive Bayesian classifier outperformed nearest neighbor and the handcrafted solution.

Moreover, the tools and techniques of adaptive behavior research could be profitably employed to build predictive models of existing or planned market systems. In addition to applications in economic modeling, "trading animals" could find use in market-based resource-allocation and control, and in internet-based commerce. After a brief overview of core concepts in experimental economics (where human trading behavior is studied under laboratory conditions), we propose that such experiments could and should be used as 'benchmarks' for evaluating and comparing different architectures and strategies for trading animats. We then present empirical results from simulations that invite a Braitenberg-style eliminative materialism perspective on the dynamics of experimental retail markets. In these experiments, an elementary machine learning technique endows simple software animats with the capability to adapt while interacting via price-bargaining in market environments. The environments are based on artificial retail markets used in experimental economics research. We demonstrate that groups of simple agents can exhibit human-like collective market behaviors, and discuss the implications.

In this paper, the best classification bands selection problem is regarded as optimal feature subset selection problem and the bands in original bands set are divided into redundant and irrelevant. In order to eliminate these two type bands, a multi-level optimal classification bands selection model from hyperspectral images based on genetic algorithm and rough set theory is proposed. Through the initial two steps of the multi-level model, the dimension reduction step and the genetic algorithm based filter step, most of redundant and irrelevant bands are deleted from the original images bands set. From the machine learning perspective, the multi-level model can take the both advantages of the filter and wrapper models.

Unlike other machine learning techniques, it allows easy incorporation of new documents into an existing trained system. Moreover, dimension reduction, which is usually imperative, now becomes optional. Thus, SVM adapts efficiently in dynamic environments that require frequent additions to the document collection.

The mean field approximation, proposed by Peterson and Anderson, can decrease the amount of these calculations. However, this approximation does not take the correlations into the consideration, and thus it reduces accuracy of the correlations. The mean field approximation, proposed by Kappen and Rodriguez, considers the correlations using the linear response theorem. They examine the effectiveness for the BM with visible units only. When one wants to examine the effectiveness in general, one has to consider the BM with hidden units as well. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of the mean field approximation based on the linear response theorem for the BM with visible and hidden units. By numerical experiments, we compare the mean field approximation proposed by Kappen and Rodriguez with the mean field approximation proposed by Peterson and Anderson. The result of the numerical experiments indicates that the mean field approximation based on the linear response theorem is not always effective.

The methods are based on active learning with two different selection measures. One is the redundant data selection (RDS) method which chooses examples with less error, and the other is the critical data selection (CDS) method which chooses examples with larger error. The partitioned data sets are used to train the experts which are then combined by a weighted majority algorithm to produce final outputs. Experiments have been performed on two data sets from the UCI machine learning database. The results show that CDS outperforms both RDS and random selection in generalization ability. We also suggest a promising way to use the data subsets partitioned by RDS.

The paradigm assumes relational isomorphism. An internal abstraction model is formed by backpropagation training with the aid of a pruning mechanism. The network also automatically develops abstraction and. de-abstraction mappings to interface the general and specific situations. It is shown that (1) the network has a good prospect for dealing with multiple sets of analogy, and (2) incremental learning of a target problem having the same isomorphic structure is efficient due to the availability of the internal abstraction model formed by the previous learning.

It is based on the newly introduced sensor-control Jacobian matrix and avoids all quantitative modeling of the robot and the sensor system. The sensor-control Jacobian contains the coefficients that relate those changes in sensor data which are caused by a motion of the robot to the robot control words that caused the robot to move and, thus, the sensor data to change. A wide variety of tasks of robots can be reduced to minimizing the differences between actual sensor data and a set of hypothetical sensor data corresponding to some desired state. All these tasks can be solved by this method. The method is especially useful for calibration-free robots, since neither quantitative models of the mechanical, kinematic and control characteristics of the robot, nor knowledge of the sensor characteristics are required. The sensor-control Jacobian may be determined automatically in real time while the robot is operating. This yields a high degree of adaptability and flexibility against unforeseen changes in the robot's parameters. Because the concept has an open structure it allows further extensions and improvements, e.g., in terms of the utilization of sensor data redundancy and machine learning. For the purpose of evaluation, the concept has been implemented on a calibration-free camera-manipulator system. Real-world grasping experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method.

Such a compensatory fuzzy logic system is proved to be a universal approximator. The compensatory neural fuzzy networks built by both control-oriented fuzzy neurons and decision-oriented fuzzy neurons cannot only adaptively adjust fuzzy membership functions but also dynamically optimize the adaptive fuzzy reasoning by using a compensatory learning algorithm. The simulation results of a cart-pole balancing system and nonlinear system modeling have shown that I) the compensatory neurofuzzy system can effectively learn commonly used fuzzy IF-THEN rules from either well-defined initial data or ill-defined data; 2) the convergence speed of the compensatory learning algorithm is faster than that of the conventional backpropagation algorithm; and 3) the efficiency of the compensatory learning algorithm can be improved by choosing an appropriate compensatory degree.

In one approach, the network activation function is based on the certainty factor (CF) model of MYCIN-like systems, In this paper, it is shown theoretically that the neural network using the CF-based activation function requires relatively small sample sizes for correct generalization. This result is also confirmed by empirical studies in,several independent domains.

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We present a straightforward procedure for aligning positive face examples for training. To collect negative examples, we use a bootstrap algorithm, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting nonface training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of nonface images. Simple heuristics, such as using the fact that faces rarely overlap in images, can further improve the accuracy. Comparisons with several other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented, showing that our system has comparable performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates.

J	Bander, JL; White, CC				Bander, JL; White, CC			A heuristic search algorithm for path determination with learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article								We present and analyze an algorithm, adaptive A* (AA*), for finding a least-cost-path from start node to goal node set in a directed graph, Are costs are assumed to be scalar-valued, and the cost of each path is the sum of the concomitant are costs. Search is guided by: I) a collection of real-valued functions on the node set, which is a generalization of the heuristic function associated with A*; 2) a set of predetermined optimal paths; 3) a set of paths in the graph that are considered desirable but may or may not be optimal. The knowledge representations described in 1) and 3) can be useful in describing knowledge acquired from humans. The knowledge representation described in 2) can be used to automate knowledge acquisition, so that A* exhibits a form of machine learning. Additionally, the collection of real-valued functions on the node set can be useful in describing bounds on the perfect heuristic function, i.e., the solution of the related dynamic program. A numerical analysis, using a specialization of AA* applied to a model of the Cleveland, OA, road network demonstrated significant performance improvement relative to A*.

This article presents variation of first order line search optimization techniques that has superlinear convergence rates, i.e. the fastest convergence rates for first order methods. The presented algorithm has substantially simplified a line search subproblem into a single step calculation of the appropriate values of step length and/or momentum term. This remarkably simplifies the implementation and computational complexity of the line search subproblem and yet does not harm the stability of the methods. The algorithm is theoretically proven to be convergent, with superlinear convergence rates, and exactly classified within the newly proposed classification framework for first order techniques. Performance of the proposed algorithm is practically evaluated on Ave data sets and compared to the relevant standard first order optimization techniques. The results indicate superior performance of the presented algorithm over the standard first order methods.

Principal curves[1] are non-parametric, nonlinear generalizations of the first principal component, and may also be regarded as continuous versions of 1-D self-organizing maps[2][3]. The new classification technique, Principal Curve Classifier (PCC), involves a novel way of computing a principal curve for each class using the class-labeled training data. An unlabeled test point is given the class-label of the principal curve that is closest to it in Euclidean distance. Preliminary experiments comparing the PCC with established classification methods, using selected datasets (originally from the UCI machine learning repository[6]) from the Elena[4][5] and Proben1[7] benchmarks, highlight the merits and limitations of this algorithm.

Unfortunately, the utility of existing analysis systems is limited by their narrow, frequently single-purpose orientation. We report a method for design of optimal edge-based image segmentation system in which the criterion of optimality is automatically determined by learning from border tracing examples. Border features employed in the designed method are selected from a predefined global set using radial-basis neural networks. The method was validated in intracardiac, intravascular, and ovarian ultrasound images. The achieved performance was comparable to that of our previously reported single-purpose border detection methods. Our approach facilitates development of general multipurpose image segmentation systems that can be trained for different types of image segmentation applications.

Furthermore, experimental results have also demonstrated that Fuzzy ARTVar compares favorably with other existing variations of Fuzzy ARTMAP, such as ARTEMAP (power rule), ARTEMAPQ (Q-max rule), and Gaussian ARTMAP. What is worth noting is that the performance of Fuzzy ARTVar is independent of the tuning of network parameters, in contrast with the ARTEMAP, ARTEMAPQ, and Gaussian ARTMAP algorithms, whose performance depends on the choice of certain network parameters.

This tool integrates image processing, data mining, and machine learning methodologies to determine the number of visually separable classes in ERS and RADARSAT sea ice images. First, it performs dynamic local thresholding to obtain local details and preserve global information throughout the image. Second, it utilizes a data discretization or image quantization scheme to obtain significant classes of the image through multiresolution blurring and tracking. Third, it computes spatial attributes of each class and subjects the information to an unsupervised clustering technique based on the Aggregated Population Equalization (APE) concept This concept self-organizes the population of classes by promoting the aggregation of different classes to obtain an equilibrium of population strengths within the environment and encouraging disintegration of any over-diverse population. We have designed ASIS as a pre-processor to help analyze sea ice images as well as to provide a basis for human classification of sea ice types that it identifies. Therefore, we have also implemented a JAVA-based graphical user interface that facilitates the computer-human interaction for this whole system. We have tested ASIS on more than 300 ERS-1, ERS-2 and RADARSAT SAR sea ice imagery. In general, the results are satisfactory. We have also conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of ASIS and found that the segmentation classes correspond well to visually identifiable sea ice classes.

An unsupervised neural network algorithm is used for initial segmentation of the spectral data space of remote sensing images. To discover concepts, a recursive region aggregation method is proposed. This method has been tested and validated with several remote sensing images. An urban zone image is used to illustrate this learning method which provides a way for fast and automatic segmentation of remote sensing images. In order to improve the efficiency of concept extraction some spatial information is incorporated into the aggregation procedure.

Thereby, it is not possible for experts to analyse the ceaseless image streams. In practice, there is a growing interest in understanding concepts discovered in classified images. Our approach to image classification is based on the conceptual clustering algorithm, Cobweb and its extensions. In general, these algorithms produce tree-structured clusters. However, once the hierarchies are built, the remote sensing experts need to compare. and to synthetize the obtained hierarchies in terms of conceptual similarities. Two algorithms are described which produce a synthesis of hierarchies. The first algorithm can be used to synthetize results generated by heterogenous hierarchical classifiers, such as K-means, Unimem, Labyrinth. The second algorithm is an extended version of Cobweb. The experiments carried on urban zones have shown the universality and the efficiency of our approaches.

Claude Shannon first described the technique for estimating the entropy of English text by a human subject guessing the next letter after viewing a string of characters taken from actual text. We show how this result is affected by using different humans in the experiment (Shannon used only his wife) and by using different types of text material (Shannon used only a single book). We also show how the results are affected when we replace the human subjects with a machine learning system based on rough sets. Automating the play of the guessing game with this system, called LERS, gives rise to a lossless data compression scheme. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. 1998.

HAP planner uses AO* based heuristic search through AND/OR graph representing all possible assembly sequences. The main problem of this approach was shown to be its computational complexity, which was somehow limited by developing efficient algorithm for generating feasible. assembly sequences. Still, when the number of such sequences are to big, the search may not be efficient. To cope with this, we present the idea about how the system can learn the "assembly rules" from previous planning and how such a knowledge can be used when searching for the optimal assembly sequence of a new assembly.

With this concept the robot automatically acquires during its normal operation the necessary knowledge which can be saved afterwards in the knowledge base and allowing the robot to adapt itself to changing conditions. Thus, the robot presents self-learning characteristics. The robot control using the knowledge base is then based on the human way of solving problems, i.e. new, additional facts (in our case control words) are developed from available facts. Such a control enables improving skills of the robot. The concept has been successfully realized and tested in real-word experiments with an uncalibrated vision-guided manipulator involving the grasping of various objects with nearly any shape and in an arbitrary orientation in horizontal plane.

Therefore it is important to find a way how to improve system's activity during its operation. This can be achieved by learning agents which modify their behaviour according to their experience. There have to be studied and developed new methods of machine learning which will prove useful for this purpose. The paper reviews the basic problems of learning in multi-agent systems and some approaches applied for their solution.

The goal is to overcome the problem of inaccuracy, due to the low precision in manufacturing of Robot Arms and the flexibility of their structure, by means of machine intelligence. Utilising a mesh sensory system, a Real Time Monitoring System is designed. The position of the end-effector is monitored in real time and the positioning data for the end-effector is collected. A direction independent filtering system is designed to eliminate the noise from the collected data. After extracting the error map from the collected data, a novel Proportional Keen Approximation Method is implemented to generalise the error map. One of the main features of this method is the elimination of the training stage as in the Artificial Neural Networks. Using the knowledge obtained from the maps, the system compensates for the errors.

It was developed in the context of the CMU Navlab project and is intended to provide the Navlabs with situational awareness in mixed traffic. Tracking is done by combining a simple image processing technique with a 3D extended Kalman filter and a measurement equation that projects from the 3D model to image space. No ground plane assumption is made. The resulting system runs at frame rate or higher, and produces excellent estimates of road curvature, distance to and relative speed of a tracked vehicle. We have complemented the tracker with a novel machine learning based algorithm for car detection, the CANSS algorithm, which serves to initialize tracking.

The proposed system learns on a per student basis how long an individual student requires to solve the problem presented by the tutor. This model of relative problem difficulty is learned within a "two-phase" learning algorithm. First, data from the entire student population are used to train a neural network. Second, the system learns how to modify the neural network's output to better fit each individual student's performance. Both components of the model proved useful in improving its accuracy. This model of time to solve a problem is used by the tutor to control the complexity of problems presented to the student.

The same format can be used for non-deterministic state machines (deterministic irt particular). Relations are represented by Labeled Rough Partitions, a structure similar to Rough Partitions introduced in [7], but scoring the full information about relations a,ld allowing for dynamic optimization of both memory requirements and processing time. We present experimental results from comparison of our delta structure to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) on binary functions (MCNC benchmarks) showing its superiority in terms of memory requirements in 73% cases. The new representation can be used to a large class of multiple-valued, completely and incompletely specified functions and relations, typical for Machine Learning (ML) and complex FSM controller optimization applications.

It has been shown that Boosting and Bagging, as two representative methods of this type, can significantly decrease the error rate of decision. tree learning. Boosting is generally more accurate than. Bagging, but the former is more variable than the latter. In addition, Bagging is amenable to parallel or distributed processing, while Boosting is not. In. this paper, we study a new committee learning algorithm, namely MB (Multiple Boosting). It creates multiple subcommittees by combining Boosting and Bagging. Experimental results in, a representative collection of natural domains show that MB is, on, average, more accurate than either Bagging or Boosting alone. It is more stable Man Boosting, and is amenable to parallel or distributed processing. These characteristics make MB a good choice for parallel datamining.

Few of these have addressed the application of derived relationships to the evaluation of commercial operations. From an industry perspective, a model must enable fruit to be rejected on the basis of a commercially significant bruise and must also accurately quantify the effects of various combinations of input features (such as cultivar, maturity, size, and so on) on bruise prediction. Input features must in turn have characteristics which are measurable commercially; for example, the measure of force should be impact energy rather than energy absorbed. Further, as the commercial criteria for acceptable damage levels change, the model should be versatile enough to update bruise thresholds from existing data, Machine learning is a burgeoning technology with a vast range of potential applications particularly in agriculture where large amounts of data can be readily collected [1]. The main advantage of using a machine learning method in an application is that the models built for prediction can be viewed and understood by the owner of the data who is in a position to determine the usefulness of the model, an essential component in a commercial environment. Machine Learning software recently developed at Waikato University [2] offers potential as a prediction tool for the classification of bruising based on historical data. It gives the user the opportunity to select any number of measured input attributes and determine the influence of that combination on a range of bruise size categories. The user may require a high degree of accuracy in the classification and therefore prune the attributes or bruise classes accordingly, or alternatively seek to discover trends in the dataset (in which case a lower level of accuracy often clarifies implicit structures in the data). Models such as the theory of elasticity suggest that impact energy and radius of curvature will have a significant effect on the bruise surface area. Cell structure is also thought to contribute to variation in bruise size [3]. The experiment described in this paper uses the machine learning programs C4.5 [4] and M5' [5] to determine the influence of impact energy, radius of curvature and impact site location on bruise area.

All activities of the robot are possible with interaction between the remote operator's decisions and the robot's local, fast reacting and learning controller. Layered, parallel controller architecture resistant to the unknown data transmission time delays constitutes important virtue of the project. The controller consists of three layers: unconditional reflex of stopping and moving from rhs nearest vicinity of the obstacles, conditioned reflex of avoiding obstacles learned from the remote human operator, dir ecr realization of teleoperator's will concerning general plan of movements of the mobile base. The remote operator receives visual information of the robot's environment from the robot's video camera. Readings from range finders located around the mobile base and from the odometry sensors help the human operator to plan movements of the robot in the initially unknown terrain.

J	Cook, DJ; Varnell, RC				Cook, DJ; Varnell, RC			Adaptive parallel iterative deepening search	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							HEURISTIC-SEARCH	Many of the artificial intelligence techniques developed to date rely on heuristic search through large spaces. Unfortunately, the size of these spaces and the corresponding computational effort reduce the applicability of otherwise novel and effective algorithms. A number of parallel and distributed approaches to search have considerably improved the performance of the search process. Our goal is to develop an architecture that automatically selects parallel search strategies for optimal performance on a variety of search problems. In this paper we describe one such architecture realized in the EUREKA system, which combines the benefits of many different approaches to parallel heuristic search. Through empirical and theoretical analyses we observe that features of the problem space directly affect the choice of optimal parallel search strategy. We than employ machine learning techniques to select the optimal parallel search strategy for a given problem space. When a new search task is input to the system, EUREKA uses features describing the search space and the chosen architecture to automatically select the appropriate search strategy. EUREKA has been tested on a MIMD parallel processor, a distributed network of workstations, and a single workstation using multireading. Results generated from fifteen puzzle problems, robot arm motion problems, artificial search spaces, and planning problems indicate that EUREKA outperforms any of the tested strategies used exclusively for all problem instances and is able to greatly reduce the search time for these applications.

J	Di Caro, G; Dorigo, M				Di Caro, G; Dorigo, M			AntNet: Distributed stigmergetic control for communications networks	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							REINFORCEMENT	This paper introduces AntNet, a novel approach to the adaptive learning of routing tables in communications networks. AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning fields. The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over real and artificial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal traffic distributions. Results are very encouraging. AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain the reasons for its superiority.

J	Moore, A; Lee, MS				Moore, A; Lee, MS			Cached sufficient statistics for efficient machine learning with large datasets	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as Icd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.

However, little attention is typically given to the validity of the features and types of rules generated by these systems and how well they perform across a variety of features and patterns. We focus on such issues of validity and comparative performance using two different types of decision free techniques. In addition, we introduce the notion of including legal perturbations of objects in the training set and show that the performance of the resulting classifiers was better than that those trained without such "legal" constructs in the data selection.

J	Ohno-Machado, L; Fraser, HS; Ohrn, A				Ohno-Machado, L; Fraser, HS; Ohrn, A			Improving machine learning performance by removing redundant cases in medical data sets	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								Neural network models and other machine learning methods have successfully been applied to several medical classification problems. These models can be periodically refined and retrained as new cases become available. Since training neural networks by backpropagation is time consuming, it is desirable that a minimum number of representative cases be kept in the training set (i.e., redundant cases should he removed). The removal of redundant cases should be carefully monitored so that classification performance is not significantly affected. Me made experiments on data removal on a data set of 700 patients suspected of having myocardial infarction and show that there is no statistical difference in classification performance (measured by the differences in areas under the ROC curve on two previously unknown sets of 553 and 500 cases) when as many as 86% of the cases are randomly removed A proportional reduction in the amount of time required to train the neural network model is achieved.

One solution to cope the difficulties in designing robots is to adopt leaning methods. Evolution-based approaches are a special kind of machine learning method and during the last few years some researchers have shown the advantages of using this kind of approach to automate the design of robots. However, the tasks achieved so far are fairly simple. In this work, we analyse the difficulties of applying evolutionary approaches to learn complex behaviours for mobile robots. And, instead of evolving the controller as a whole, we propose to take the control architecture of a behavior-based system and to learn the separate behaviours and the arbitration by the use of an evolutionary approach. By using the technique of task decomposition, the job of defining fitness functions becomes more straightforward and the tasks become easier to achieve. To assess the performance of the developed approach, we have evolved a control system to achieve an application task of box-pushing as an example. Experimental results show the promise and efficiency of the presented approach.

Sentences with these errors are a bottle-neck to NLP systems because they cannot be parsed correctly. Human beings are able to overcome this problem (either occurring in spoken or written language) since they are capable of doing a semantic similarity search to find out if a similar utterance has been heard before or a syntactic similarity search for a stored utterance that shares structural similarities with the input. If the syntactic and semantic analysis of the rest of the input can be done correctly, then a 'gap' that exists in the utterance, can be uniquely identified. In this paper, a system named SAUCOLA which is based on a concept lattice, that mimics human skills in resolving knowledge gaps that exist in written language is presented. The preliminary results show that correct stored sentences can be retrieved based on the words contained in the incorrect input sentence.

The main part of the expenditure concerning simulation analyses is the modeling of the considered production. Despite the use of modern building block-oriented modeling technology, this modeling can often not be done by the user, but only by external experts. Against this backdrop, an adaptive simulation system is being developed by the Institute for Industrial Manufacturing and Management (IFF) at the University of Stuttgart. It independently adapts to real production processes and, in this way, supports the user in constructing and maintaining the model. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

These simulations can lead the decision maker to the selection of the most promising penetration strategy for the product under development and thus reducing the relevant risk. In this paper, inductive learning algorithms are used in order to perform various market simulations and gain some knowledge, in the form of rules, concerning the behaviour and preferences of the consumers.

We researched these parameters in a genetic-based machine learning system Galactica which was used to discover the differential diagnostic rules for female urinary incontinence from case data. The performance of the system was measured with on-line and off-line criteria. Surprisingly, randomly generated small populations (30 and 70 rules) did not promote the best on-line performance as earlier results suggested Probable explanation is the lack of diversity in initial populations. The seeding of population with positive learning examples was used to obtain more divergent populations. As expected the seeding increased the on-line performance of small populations. The results ape mainly in accord with the earlier results indicating that large randomly generated populations (ISO rules) lead to the better off-line performance. Again, the seeding of small populations was successful producing even the better off-line performance than a large population.

Because staging of dementia severity is economically and clinically important, we used Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to identify simpler models for estimating total CDR scores. Compared to a gold standard, which required 34 attributes to derive total CDR scores, ML algorithms identified models with as few as seven attributes. The classification accuracy varied with the algorithm used with naive Bayes giving the highest. (76%) The mildly demented severity class was the only one with significantly reduced accuracy (59%). If one groups the severity classes into normal, very mild-to-mildly demented, and moderate-to-severely demented, then classification accuracies are clinically acceptable (85%). These simple models can be used in community settings where it is currently not possible to estimate dementia severity due to time and cost constraints.

A number of decision aids have been developed to assist with this problem but have not achieved general use. Machine learning techniques, including classification tree and logistic regression (LR) methods, have the potential to create simple but accurate decision aids. Both a classification free (FT Tree) and an LR model (FT LR) have been developed to predict the probability that a patient with chest pain is having an MI based solely upon data available at time of presentation to the ER. Training data came from a data set collected in Edinburgh, Scotland. Each model was then tested on a separate Edinburgh data set, as well as on a data set from a different hospital in Sheffield, England. previously published models, the Goldman classification tree[1] and Kennedy LR equation[2] were evaluated on the same test data sets On the Edinburgh test set, results showed that the FT Tree, FT LR, and Kennedy LR performed equally well with ROC curve areas of 94.04%, 94.28%, and 94.30%, respectively while the Goldman Tree's performance was significantly poorer, with an area of 84.03%. The difference in ROC areas between the first three models and the Goldman model is significant beyond the 0.0001 level. On the Sheffield test set, results showed that the FT Tree, FT LR, and Kennedy LR ROC areas were not significantly different (p >= 0.17), while the FT Tree again oldperformed the Goldman Tree (p = 0.006). Unlike previous work[3] this study indicates that classification trees, which have certain advantages over LR models, may perform as well as LR models in the diagnosis of patients with MI.

This article presents a computer system for predicting the incidence of myocardial infarction from angiographic morphological descriptions of coronary lesions. The system includes two phases. The learning phase consists in extracting from a large database of described stenoses two classes represented by one or several fuzzy prototypes. One class corresponds to stenoses leading to infarction and the other to stenoses not leading to that event. The evaluation phase consists in classifying a stenosis according to its morphological characteristics in one of these two classes. The learning method is based on a fuzzy supervised Machine Learning algorithm that combines some aspects of the K-nearest neighbours clustering approach with a defined measure of similarity, and a prototype induction function from the most similar stenoses, faking into account their degree of typicality. The current results of the evaluation phase to correctly predicted X % stenoses for their risk of myocardial infarction. This article emphasizes the feasibility of the approach, however, the learning phase relies on some heuristics that should be validated to get a formal evaluation of the system.

However, in the Petri Net we have to represent all kinds of processes by separate subnets even though the process has the same behavior of other one. Real-world knowledge often contains many parts which are similar, but not identical. This means that the fetal PTN becomes very large. The kind of problems may be annoying for a small system, and it may be catastrophic for the description of large-scale system. To avoid this kind of problems we propose a learning and reasoning method using FCPNs under uncertainty. On the other hand to correct the rules of knowledge-based system hand-built classifier and empirical learning method both based on domain theory have been proposed as machine learning methods, where there is. a significant gap between the knowledge-intensive approach in the former and the virtually knowledge-free approach in the later. To resolve such problems simultaneously we propose a hybrid learning method which is built an the top of knowledge-based FCPN and Genetic Algorithms (GA). To verify the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed system, we have successfully applied it to the diagnosis of intervertebral diseases.

Many retrieval systems for multimedia information resources Slave been developed only focused on their efficiency and performance. Therefore, they cannot deal with user's preferences and interests well. In this paper, we present the framework design of a personalized image retrieval system (PIRS) which can reflect user's preferences and interests incrementally. The prototype of PIRS consists of two major parts: user's preference model (UPM) and retrieval module (RM). The UPM plays a role of refining user's query to meet with user's needs. The KM retrieves the proper images for refined query by computing the similarities between each image and refined query, and the retrieved images are ordered by these similarities. In this paper, we mainly discuss about UPM. The incremental machine learning technologies have been employed to provide the user adaptable and intelligent capability to the system. The UPM is implemented by decision tree based on incremental tree induction (ITI), and adaptive resonance theory (ART) network. User's feedbacks are returned to the UPM, and they modify internal structure of the UPM. User's iterative retrieval activities with PIRS cause the UPM to be revised for user's preferences and interests. Therefore, the PIRS can be adapted to user's preferences and interests. We have achieved encouraging results through experiments.

We first derive a statistic, kappa(B), for measuring the agreement between two partitionings of an image set into unlabeled subsets. This measure can be used to measure both the degree of agreement between pairs of human subjects and that between human and machine partitionings of an image set. It also allows a direct comparison of database organizations, as opposed to the indirect measure available via precision and recall measurements. This provides a rigorous means of selecting between competing image database organization systems, and assessing how close the performance of such systems is to that which might be expected from a database organization done by hand. We then use the results of experiments in which human subjects are asked to partition a set of images into unlabeld subsets to define a similarity measure for pairs of images based on the frequency with which they were judged to be similar. We show that, when this measure is used to partition an image set using a clustering technique, the resultant clustering agrees better with those produced by human subjects than any of the feature space-based techniques investigated. Finally, we investigate the use of machine learning techniques to discover a mapping from a numerical feature space to this perceptual similarity space. Such a mapping would allow the ground truth knowledge abstracted from the human judgments to be generalized to unseen images. We show that a learning technique based on an extension of a Kohonen network allows a similarity space to be learnt which results in partitionings in excellent agreement with those produced by human subjects.

J	Ben Choi, CH				Ben Choi, CH			Automata for learning sequential tasks	NEW GENERATION COMPUTING			English	Article						learning sequential tasks; machine learning; inference mechanisms; finite state machines; learning from examples	INFERENCE	This paper describes a system that is capable of learning both combinational and sequential tasks. The system learns from sequences of input/output examples in which each pair of input and output represents a step in a task. The system uses finite state machines as its internal models. This paper proposes a method for inferring finite state machines from examples. New algorithms are developed for modifying the finite state machines to allow the system to adapt to changes. In addition, new algorithms are developed to allow the system to handle inconsistent information that may result from noise in the training examples. The system can handle sequential tasks involving long-term dependencies for which recurrent neural networks have been shown to be inadequate. Moreover, the learned finite state machines are easy to be implemented in VLSI. The system has a wide range of applications including but not limited to (a) sequence detection, prediction, and production, (b) intelligent macro systems that can learn rather than simply record sequences of steps performed by a computer user, and (c) design automation systems for designing finite state machines or sequential circuits.

J	Califf, ME; Mooney, RJ				Califf, ME; Mooney, RJ			Advantages of decision lists and implicit negatives in inductive logic programming	NEW GENERATION COMPUTING			English	Article						inductive logic programming; machine learning; decision lists	DEFINITIONS	This paper demonstrates the capabilities of FOIDL, an inductive logic programming (ILP) system whose distinguishing characteristics are the ability to produce first-order decision lists, the use of an output completeness assumption as a substitute for negative examples, and the use of intensional background knowledge. The development of FOIDL was originally motivated by the problem of learning to generate the past tense of English verbs; however, this paper demonstrates its superior performance on two different sets of benchmark ILP problems. Tests on the finite element mesh design problem show that FOIDL's decision lists enable it to produce generally more accurate results than a range of methods previously applied to this problem. Tests with a selection of list-processing problems from Bratko's introductory Prolog text demonstrate that the combination of implicit negatives and intensionality allow FOIDL to learn correct programs from far fewer examples than FOIL.

We believe the interface should be sufficiently efficient and easy-to-use that a physician can code information during the consultation without detracting from doctor-patient interaction. In this way: the benefits of a "clinical workstation" setting, such as best practices guidance and drug interaction detection, are maximised. We pursue the strategy of applying machine learning to existing databases of electronic medical records to develop probabilistic models of general practice. Based on this model we have simulated and prototyped data entry interfaces with "hot lists" (short pick-list menus of relevant items) and dynamic graphical depictions of contextually-likely clinical data.

This approach is more general than traditional symbolic approaches to concept learning and fan be applied in situations where preclassified training examples are not, necessarily available. An experimental study is described in which a coevolutionary immune system adapts itself to one of the standard machine learning data sets. The resulting immune system concept description and a description produced by a traditional symbolic concept learner are compared and contrasted.

J	Amin, A; Singh, S				Amin, A; Singh, S			Recognition of hand-printed Chinese characters using decision trees/machine learning C4.5 system	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Chinese characters; feature extraction; hough transform; machine learning; parallel thinning algorithm	PARALLEL THINNING ALGORITHMS; HEBREW CHARACTERS; BINARY PATTERNS	Recognition of Chinese characters has been an area of major interest for many years, and a large number of research papers and reports have already been published in this area. There are several major problems with Chinese character recognition: Chinese characters are distinct and ideographic, the character size is very large and a lot of structurally similar characters exist in the character set. Thus, classification criteria are difficult to generate. This paper presents a new technique for the recognition of hand-printed Chinese characters using the C4.5 machine learning system. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The gaper discusses Chinese character recognition using the Hough transform for feature extraction and C4.5 system. The system was tested with 900 characters written by different writers from poor to acceptable quality (each character has 40 samples) and the rate of recognition obtained was 84%.

They repeatedly build different classifiers using a base learning algorithm by changing the distribution of the training set. SASC, as a different type of committee learning method, can also significantly reduce the error rate of decision trees. It generates classifier committees by stochastically modifying the set of attributes but keeping the distribution of the training set unchanged. It has been shown that Bagging and SASC are, on average, less accurate than Boosting, but the performance of the former is more stable than that of the latter in terms of less frequently obtaining significantly higher error rates than the base learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel committee learning algorithm, called SASCBAG, that combines SASC and Bagging. It creates different classifiers by stochastically varying both the attribute set and the distribution of the training set. Experimental results in a representative collection of natural domains show that, for decision tree learning, the new algorithm is, on average, more accurate than Boosting, Bagging, and SASC. It is more stable than Boosting. In addition, like Bagging and SASC, SASCBAG is amenable to parallel and distributed processing while Boosting is not. This gives SASCBAG another advantage over Boosting for parallel machine learning and datamining.

Recently, it was shown that those associations that are missing in data may also be interesting. These missing associations are the holes or empty regions. The existing algorithm for discovering holes has a number of shortcomings. It requires each hole to contain no data point, which is too restrictive for many real-life applications. It also has a very high complexity, and produces a huge number of holes. Additionally, the algorithm only works in a continuous space, and does not allow any discrete/nominal attribute. These drawbacks limit its applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these shortcomings. This approach transforms the holes-discovery problem into a supervised learning task, and then uses the decision tree induction technique for discovering holes in data.

A subtree is considered unreliable and therefore is pruned if the description length of the classification of the corresponding subsets of training instances together with the description lengths of each path in the subtree is greater than the description length of the classification of the whole subset of training instances in the current node. We compare the perfomance of our simple, parameterless, and well-founded MDL method with some other methods on 18 datasets. The classification accuracy using the MDL pruning is comparable to other approaches and the decision trees are nearly optimally pruned which makes our method an attractive tool for obtaining a first approximation of the target decision tree during the knowledge discovery process.

In particular, for the glaucoma, diagnosis ive target here, the ocular fundus image can be easily obtained and can be used to automatically identify whether an eye is glaucomatous or not. However, the image has a two-dimensional distribution, and it is difficult to feature the whole image through some real-valued parameters in general. This paper proposes a machine learning method using a set of expert's decision cases that identify local abnormalities of an image. This method finds regularities between an image set and the decision cases using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Unlike decision-tree learning and neural networks, ILP allows relational learning between concepts. Learned rules are abstract enough to absorb noisy data obtained directly from image analysis. We applied the method to detecting early glaucomatous eyes. Our ILP system, GKS produced 30 rules from 2000 positive and negative examples that were obtained by segmenting 39 glaucomatous eyes. A 10-fold cross validation assessment shows about 80% sensitivity and 65% accuracy of the rules, resulting in the high performance comparable with human-level classification.

In the KDD context, data mining is often used for description purposes rather than for prediction. However, it turns out difficult to find clustering systems that help to ease the interpretation task to the user in both, statistics and Machine Learning fields. In this paper we present ISAAC, a hierarchical clustering system which employs traditional clustering ideas combined with a feature selection mechanism and heuristics in order to provide comprehensible results. At the same time, it allows to efficiently deal with large datasets by means of a preprocessing step. Results suggest that these aims are achieved and encourage further research.

The number of resulting intervals obtained by discretization depends only on the data; the number of groups corresponds to the number of classes. Since both discretization and grouping is done with respect to the goal classes, the algorithms are suitable only for classification/prediction tasks. As a side effect of the off-line processing, the number of objects in the datasets and number of attributes may be reduced. It should be also mentioned that although the original idea of the discretization procedure is proposed to the KEX system, the algorithms show good performance together with other machine learning algorithms.

This kind of learning has been simulated with computer in the form of adaptive production system. However, the mechanism by which new productions are acquired is still unclear. Anderson etc. claim that production would first be learned as a verbal proposition before being transerred into a skill of perceiving the cues and responding to them. Our research show that this is not the case of learning from examples and by doing. It was found that subjects can acquire knowledge in the form of production directly, without learning the vebal proposition of knowledge. In this paper, a theory of constructing and elaborating of conditions(CEC) to explain the mechanism of knowledge acquisition from examples and by doing was proposed, and the application of CEC theory in education was introduced as well.

In this paper we study their posibilities and potential benefits for the field of acoustic modeling. We describe preliminary experiments using an alternative modeling approach known as factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs). We present these models as extensions of HMMs and detail a modification to the original formulation which seems to allow a more natural fit to speech. We present experimental results on the phonetically balanced TIMIT database comparing the performance of FHMMs with HMMs. We also study alternative feature representations that might be more suited to FHMMs.	Digital Equipment Corp, Cambridge Res Labs, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA	Logan, B (reprint author), Digital Equipment Corp, Cambridge Res Labs, 1 Kendall Sq,Bldg 700,2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.							0	13	15	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1520-6149	0-7803-4428-6	INT CONF ACOUST SPEE			1998							813	816				4	Acoustics; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Acoustics; Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications	BL16B	WOS:000074520700204

The data used for testing, contained 90 records, each described by 24 attributes, measured before and after the surgery. The surgeries were performed on children in the age from 2 to 10 years. The purpose of making these measurements was to find those attributes, which are significant for determining predisposition to two forms of acidemia: metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. By applying various statistical methods to the set of records, we established, which attributes are statistically significant. These results were then compared to results, which we got from using the same data set to build different decision trees. We succeeded to show that some statistical methods and decision trees can give almost identical results, where the decision trees do not require special knowledge of statistics. The results were also carefully examined by the medical experts.

We compared power spectrum calculated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and auto regressive (AR) coefficients calculated by Burg's algorithm. We analyzed four surface EEG signals recorded above sensory-motor areas, while the subject was attempting to use only mental activities to modulate his EEG signals resulting in desired simple movements of animated object on the feedback computer screen. To establish communication channel based on EEG signals, we asked our subject to determine which mental activity produced reproducible control actions. During the online training we used AR coefficients of recorded EEG signals for the feedback generating variables, i.e. the object's movement direction and speed were dependent on the EEG pattern. Our subject was able to determine which mental activity resulted in desired movements and to learn to control object movements with more than 90% accuracy. We performed off-line analysis to determine if FFT or AR can be more successful in extracting relevant information from the EEG signals before performing pattern recognition by a machine learning classifier. Probability of misclassification was used as the outcome measure. Off-line analysis showed that the overall best classification accuracy achieved with AR exceeds that achieved with FFT.

The study was motivated by earlier studies showing the following: I) cyclic functional movements (e.g., walking) are synergistic [1] and 2) machine learning techniques for recognizing gait events perform similar when a training set includes one or more joint angles [2]. The results of this study prove that the only one joint angle sensor is sufficient to describe a cyclic motor pattern, and that the second joint angle sensor is redundant for cyclic activities, but very useful to detect the change of the mode of locomotion or hazard [3]. The results of the study will be implemented for restoring walking of humans with disabilities using a functional electrical stimulation system.

The nonlinear relationship between hand posture and stimulus intensities were quantified by applying electrical stimulation to the supinator, wrist extensor and wrist flexor through percutaneous electrodes and measuring the supination and wrist extension angle in a hemiplegic subject. The measured relationship was modeled with a backpropagation neural network. The stimulus parameters generated by the trained network from the desired trajectory was applied to the subject. The result showed the feasibility to control the hand posture with the stimulus pattern generated automatically using a machine learning system.

Unfortunately, their success is usually dependant on the quality of the data that they operate on. If the data is inadequate, or contains extraneous and irrelevant information, machine learning algorithms may produce less accurate and less understandable results, or may fail to discover anything of use at all. Feature subset selectors are algorithms that attempt to identify and remove as much irrelevant and redundant information as possible prior to learning. Feature subset selection can result in enhanced performance, a reduced hypothesis search space, and, in some cases, reduced storage requirement. This paper describes a new feature selection algorithm that uses a correlation based heuristic to determine the "goodness" of feature subsets, and evaluates its effectiveness with three common machine learning algorithms. Experiments using a number of standard machine learning data sets are presented. Feature subset selection gave significant improvement for all three algorithms.

We give the user a convenient tool to assist him in the application of machine learning algorithms to his data collection stored in the same database. By deriving full benefit of the available powerful logic and object-oriented programming language, we have implemented an easily extendable representative collection of existing instance-based and model-based learning algorithms. In addition, we have also developed several new algorithms as well as an evaluation module, which provides cross-validation trials and significance tests for the performance differences between different learning algorithms. This facilitates the difficult task for the user to select the best algorithm for a specific learning problem. As realistic case study for the feasibility of ILE we applied it to the automatic acquisition of linguistic knowledge within a natural language database interface. The learning problem was here to select the correct command class based on semantic features extracted from the user input. Considering the complexity of the task, we achieved surprisingly good results, which demonstrates convincingly the benefits of our approach.

An investigation of the comprehensibility of the discovered patterns may benefit IS research as well. This paper attempts to identify some of the issues that such inquiry may face. Related findings and conclusions of four case studies focusing on applications of decision tree induction methods, are described. A discussion based on these studies suggests, among the rest, that. (1) The problem of comprehensibility is complicated by a complex context due to a diversity of problem-domain attributes, user and task characteristics, algorithmic methods, and concurrency of user goals. (2) Solutions to problems of discovered patterns that are not easy to interpret and validate may involve integration of available information technologies, and utilization of multiple information types and sources. (3) An investigation of comprehensibility issues may benefit from the adoption of multiple definitions in relation to this concept.

Machine learning has been one of the methods used in most of these data mining applications. The data used as input to any of these learning systems are the primary source of knowledge in terms of what is learned by these systems. There have been relatively few studies on preprocessing data used as input in these data mining systems. In this study, we evaluate several feature selection methods as to their effectiveness in preprocessing input data. We use real-world financial credit-risk data in evaluating these systems.

We annotated a corpus of tutoring dialogues with an SGML-based representation of tutorial goals in order to make mechanical processing possible. We looked for rules of the form "under what conditions is goal x implemented with plan y?". We discovered rules for high-level planning of the tutoring session and dynamic modification of the tutorial agenda. At a lower level of planning, we looked at rules for generating sections of the tutor's utterance. The use of the rule induction algorithm has helped us discover which knowledge available to the planner is significant in making these decisions, as well as producing some decision trees we can actually use in CIRCSIM-Tutor.

This particular type of learning task can be found in many machine learning applications but is of special importance for machine learning of natural language. Besides pure instance-based learning we also consider prototype-based learning, which has the big advantage of a large reduction of the required memory and processing time for classification. As an application for our learning algorithms we have chosen natural language database interfaces. In our interface architecture the machine learning module replaces an elaborate semantic analysis component. The learning task is to select the correct command class based on semantic features extracted from the user input. We use an existing German natural language interface to a production planning and control system as a case study for our evaluation and compare the results achieved by the different lazy learning algorithms.

This measure is defined between an attribute set and a class and corresponds to a generalization of the Mantaras distance that allows to detect the interdependencies between attributes. In the same way, the proposed measure allows to order the attributes by importance in the definition of the concept. This measure does not exhibit a noticeable bias in favor of attributes with many values. The quality of the selected attributes using the GD measure is tested by means of different comparisons with other two attribute selection methods over 19 datasets.

In this paper we present a new general strategy aimed to mitigate these effects, the Not-Yet, strategy which has a general and open formulation and it is riot coupled to any particular system. Unlike other proposals, this strategy maintains the incremental nature of learning process. In addition, we propose a classification of strategics to avoid ordering effects which clarifies the benefits and disadvantages we can expect from the proposal made in the paper as well from existing ones. A particular implementation of the Not-Yet strategy is used to conduct several experiments. Results suggest that the strategy improves the clustering quality. We also show that, when combined with other local strategies, the Not-Yet strategy allows the clustering system to get high quality clusterings.

These systems may be integrated into a single distributed system, with the expectation of obtaining a group performance more satisfactory than individual performances. Such a distributed system is what we call a Multi Agent Decision System (MADES), a special kind of Multi Agent System, that integrates several heterogeneous autonomous decision systems (agents). A MADES must produce a single solution proposal for the problem instance it faces, despite the fact that its decision making is distributed, and every agent produces solution proposals according to its local view and to its idiosyncrasy. We present a distributed reinforcement algorithm for learning how to combine the decisions the agents make in a distributed way, into a single group decision (solution proposal).

Bayesian approaches, for instance, require assumptions about data distributions. Decision Trees on the other hand, require sorting operations to deal with continuous attributes, which largely increase learning times. This paper presents a new method of discretization, whose main characteristic is that it takes into account interdependencies between attributes. Detecting interdependencies can be seen as discovering redundant attributes. This means that our method performs attribute selection as a side effect of the discretization. Empirical evaluation on five benchmark datasets from UCI repository, using C4.5 and a naive Bayes, shows a consistent reduction of the features without loss of generalization accuracy.

This work presents a two stage process for the specification of high performing backpropagation neural networks for four commonly used real world databases. GAs are used to evolve a set of potential neural network architectures and operating parameters. The best networks are then used for further training and testing, to determine an optimum starting seed and number of training passes. In order to test and compare networks developed in this way, an exhaustive set of experiments using the machine learning induction algorithm, C4.5 were also carried out on the four databases. These results, together with some previously published benchmark data and BPNN results, were compared with those obtained from the networks developed using our method. Our results compare more than favourably with the C4.5, Holte's 1R* benchmark and previously published BPNN results across the four databases. It is hoped that this work may lead to the development of an integrated tool for use in the solution of difficult real world classification problems.

This situation occurs very often in practical problems in which the environment changes over time, e.g., in financial investment problems. The well known back propagation method in artificial neural networks is not effective for such incremental learning. On the other hand, the mathematical programming approach and the hypersphere methods including RBF(Radial Base Function), KNN(k Nearest Neighborhood) and the potential method are promising for this purpose. In this paper, the ability of incremental learning is comparatively discussed among the above methods. Examples in stock portfolio problems show the effectiveness of incremental learning.

Some algorithms can be slowed or their performance adversely affected by too much data-some of which may be irrelevant or redundant to the learning task. Feature subset selection, then, is a method for enhancing the performance of learning algorithms, reducing the hypothesis search space, and. in some cases, reducing the storage requirement. This paper describes a feature subset selector that uses a correlation based heuristic to determine the "goodness" of feature subsets, and evaluates its effectiveness with three common ML algorithms: a decision tree inducer (C4.5), a naive Bayes classifier, and an instance based learner (IB1). Experiments using a number of standard data sets drawn from real and artificial domains me presented. Feature subset selection gave significant improvement for all three algorithms; C4.5 generated smaller decision trees.

An overview of methods of rule extraction or rule discovery is described. Rule extraction or rule discovery using neural networks, however, is not easy due mainly to distributed representation in a network. Most of the existing methods suffer from this difficulty, hence the crucial issue has been how to extract rules from trained neural networks. The authors claim that the use of structural learning methods suppressing distributed representation instead of unsophisticated learning methods such as back propagation is essential in discovering rules from data. Because of this, the use of structural learning with forgetting(SLF) is proposed. A brief description of SLF is also presented. Generally speaking, neural networks are more suitable for discovering rules from data with continuous valued inputs than machine learning methods. SLF, applied to three kinds of tasks, i.e., division of a plane, diagnosis of thyroid functioning and the classification of irises, well demonstrates its effectiveness.

Several techniques have been introduced to deal with the problem which include inexact learning strategies, such as rough set based approaches and probabilistic approaches. This paper presents an approach for detecting trend using contribution functions. A trend directed method for the discovery of knowledge structure from low quality data bases is described. The experimental results show that trend directed methods are superior to other learning strategies, particularly when the learning is performed on low quality data bases.

Most current clustering algorithms assume that variables within classes are uncorrelated. We present a method for producing and evaluating models which account for inter-attribute correlation within classes with a single Gaussian linear factor. The method used is Minimum Message Length (MML), an invariant, information-theoretic Bayesian hypothesis evaluation criterion. Our work extends and unifies that of Wallace and Boulton (1968) and Wallace and Freeman (1992), concerned respectively with MML mixture modelling and MML single factor analysis. Results on simulated data are comparable to those of Wallace and Freeman (1992), outperforming Maximum Likelihood. We include an application of mixture modelling with single factors on spectral data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite. Our model shows fewer unnecessary classes than that produced by AutoClass (Goebel et. al. 1989) due to the use of factors in modelling correlation.

The program first divides the compounds into similar classes. It then utilizes machine learning to derive a set of rules that relate structure to activity for each class. Then it finds the common features among all classes. These common features are used by a geometrical fitting program that tries to a 3D fit between these features between minimized conformations for every active molecule in every class. Such a tit is used to infer a pharmacophore.

The system is based on the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques data mining, expert systems and multi-agent systems. The work is based on the following lines of actions: (a) the use of distributed agents for the intelligent search of information in the network; supplying it in a more abstract way, adapted to the decision-making task; (b) the use of machine learning and data-mining techniques that, starting from the log files which register previous problems and their solution, allow the use of experience thus obtained in the solution new problems; and (c) the use of heuristics and conduction rules supplied by experts, through a decision support system: as an advisor element to network operators. This paper presents a discussion about the techniques employed along these three research lines and the results already obtained.

As a consequence, it is becoming increasingly important to provide efficient and flexible solutions for accessing and retrieving multimedia data. Images and video are emerging as significant data types in multimedia systems. And yet, most commercial systems are still text and hey-word based and do not fully exploit the image content of these systems. We believe that there is an opportunity to build a novel interactive multimedia system for some specific applications in electronic commerce. In this paper we present an overview of our approach, the rationale behind it and the problems that are inherent in building such a system. We address some of the technical issues in representing and analysing image primitive features. These are the building blocks of any such systems. They can be generalized into a much broader range of applications as well.

In other approaches, information is classified according to a predefined set of classes and classification is either performed manually or using class-specific algorithms. Most of these systems lack flexibility: the user does not have the ability to define or change the classes, and new classification schemes require implementation of new class-specific algorithms and/or the input of an expert. In this paper, we present a different approach to content-based retrieval and a novel framework for classification of visual information in which (1) users define their own visual classes and classifiers are learned automatically; and (2) multiple fuzzy-classifiers and machine learning techniques are combined for automatic classification at multiple levels (region, perceptual object-part, object and scene). We present The Visual Apprentice, an implementation of our framework for still images and video that uses a combination of lazy-learning, decision trees, and evolution programs for classification and grouping. Our system is flexible in that models can be changed by users over time, different types of classifiers are combined, and user-model definitions can be applied to object and scene structure classification. Special emphasis is placed on the difference between semantic and visual classes, and between classification and detection. Examples and results are presented to demonstrate the applicability of our approach to perform visual classification and detection.

This is based on representing chemical structure by atoms and their bond connectivities in combination with the Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) algorithm Progol. Existing SAR methods describe chemical structure using attributes which are general properties of an object. It is not possible to map directly chemical structure to attribute-based descriptions, as such descriptions have no internal organisation. A more natural and general way to describe chemical structure is to use a relational description, where the internal construction of the description maps that of the object described. Our atom and bond connectivities representation is a relational description. ILP algorithms can form SARs with relational descriptions. We have tested the relational approach by investigating the SAR of 230 aromatic and hereroaromatic nitro compounds. These compounds had been split previously into two sub-sets, 188 compounds that were amenable to regression, and 42 that were not. For the 188 compounds, a SAR was found that was as accurate as the best statistical or neural network generated SARs. The Progol SAR has the advantages that it did not need the use of any indicator variables hand-crafted by an expert, and the generated rules were easily comprehensible. For the 42 compounds, Progol formed a SAR that was significantly (P < 0.025) more accurate than Linear regression, quadratic regression, and back-propagation.

Fuzzy systems that can automatically derive fuzzy if-then rules and membership functions from numeric data have recently been developed. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical representation for membership functions, and design a procedure to derive them. Experimental results on the Iris data show that our method can achieve high accuracy. The proposed method is thus useful in constructing membership functions and in managing uncertainty and vagueness.

Given any similarity measure between regions, satisfying some weak constraints, we give a general predicate for answering if two regions are to be merged or not during the segmentation process. Our predicate is generic and has six properties. The first one is its independance with respect to the similarity measure, that leads to a user-independant and adaptative predicate. Second, it is non-parametric, and does not rely on any assumption concerning the image. Third, due to its weak constraints, knowledge may be included in the predicate to fit better to the user's behaviour. Fourth, provided the similarity is well-chosen by the user, we are able to upperbound one type of error made during the image segmentation. Fifth, it does not rely on a particular segmentation algorithm and can be used with almost all region-merging algorithms in various application domains. Sixth, it is calculated quickly, and can lead with appropriated algorithms to very efficient segmentation.

Using virtual memory results to a significant performance degradation. To overcome such shortcomings, we developed a classification rule induction algorithm for relational databases. Our algorithm uses a bottom-up rule generation strategy that is more effective for mining databases having large cardinality of nominal variables. We have successfully used our algorithm to mine a retail grocery database containing more than 1.6 million records in about 5 hours on a dual Pentium processor PC.

Firstly, the deductive object manager ConceptBase is intended to enrich the semantics of data warehouse solutions by including an explicit enterprise-centered concept of quality. The positive impact of precise multidimensional data models on the client interface is demonstrated by CoDecide, an Internet-based toolkit for the flexible visualization of multiple, interrelated data cubes. Finally, MIDAS is a hybrid data mining system which analyses multi-dimensional data to further enrich the semantics of the meta database, using a combination of neural network techniques, fuzzy logic, and machine learning.

The goal is to develop a simple set of rules which can be used as heuristics in place of the optimization procedure for future cases. This methodology has been applied to two distinct problems: a selection problem formulated as a multi-bin knapsack problem, and a cutting-stock problem. In the selection problem, both learning methods were correct in over 85% of the cases examined. Since a random selection procedure would only correctly classify 58% of the cases, it can be concluded that learning is occurring. On the other hand, both learning algorithms accurately classify only about 80% of the patterns examined in the cutting-stock problem. Since it is possible to correctly classify approximately 81% of the patterns by simply rejecting every pattern, learning does not appear to be occurring in this problem. This paper provides a description of the two problems as well as the results of the learning on each problem. Additionally, a brief discussion of the similarities and differences in the problems is provided.

It will be demonstrated that much has changed and little has changed. Then specific and general instances of ergodicity as a potential new paradigm for learning systems, are advanced. In particular, the widely used Backpropagation neural network algorithm is shown to contain ergodic learning regimes. Recent experiments and issues in human versus machine learning are discussed. A general philosophy that learning should be ergodic until sufficient context is established, is proposed.

These models are improved over time, given feedback on the delivered documents. When selecting documents to recommend, a system faces an instance of the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. whether to deliver documents about which there is little certainty, or those which are known to match the user model learned so far. In this paper, a simulation is constructed to investigate the effects of this tradeoff on the rate of learning user models, and the resulting compositions of the sets of recommended documents, in particular World-Wide Web pages. Document selection strategies are developed which correspond to different points along the tradeoff. Using an exploitative strategy, our results show that simple preference functions can successfully be learned using a vector-space representation of a user model in conjunction with a gradient descent algorithm, but that increasingly complex preference functions lead to a slowing down of the learning process. Exploratory strategies are shown to increase the rate of user model acquisition at the expense of presenting users with suboptimal recommendations; in addition they adapt to user preference changes more rapidly than exploitative strategies. These simulated tests suggest an implementation for a simple control that is exposed to users, allowing them to vary a system's document selection behavior depending on individual circumstances.

Inverse of biodegradability is environmental persistence, from which possible dynamics of soil, groundwater and water pollution can be inferred. We tried to predict the biodegradability with several programs that can learn from examples and construct decision or regression trees and/or can construct equations. Besides the given basic topological properties, the maid contribution was inclusion of connectivity indices. Above all, normalization of properties to molecular weight or the number of carbon atoms significantly improved prediction. The obtained results are comparable (or better) to the best achieved results with other approaches. Contrary to the statistical methods, ML tools present the information (learned knowledge) in a compact, easily understandable manner which can help identify and understand the key properties of chemicals and mechanisms important for assessing biodegradation(and thus possible environmental contamination) from chemical structure only.

The problem selecting the most appropriate data mining method(s) has long been solved using static selection methods and it is only recently that several effective dynamic selection approaches have been proposed, it is expected that dynamic selection that takes into account the expertise areas of each method will lead to better data mining results. The goal of this paper is to analyze a method for dynamic selection of diagnostic methods. This method is proposed for use in an intelligent medical diagnostic system. Real-world medical data is often heterogeneous, containing many cases and attributes, and it needs different processing methods for different cases. The dynamic selection method was tested using three databases included in the University of California Machine Learning Repository, achieving promising results either in diagnosis accuracy and/or in Me time requirements of diagnostics.

Instead of continuing to recreate components similar to existing artifacts, and considering the rising costs of development, many organizations would like to decrease software development costs and cycle time by reusing existing OO components. This paper proposes an experiment to verify three hypotheses about the impact of three internal characteristics (inheritance, coupling and complexity) of OO applications on reusability This verification is done through a machine-learning approach (C4.5 algorithm and windowing technique). Two kinds of results are produced : (I) for each hypothesis (characteristic), a predictive model is built using a set of metrics derived from this characteristic, and (2) for each predictive model, we measure its completeness, correctness, and global accuracy.

The most common analysis tool that these modern systems apply is the operating system audit trail that provides a fingerprint of system events over time. In this research, the Basic Security Module auditing tool of Sun's Solaris operating environment was used in both an anomoly and misuse detection approach. The anomoly detector consisted of the statistical likelihood analysis of system calls, while the misuse detector was built with a neural network trained on groupings of system calls. This research demonstrates the potential benefits of combining both aspects of detection in future IDS's to decrease false positive and false negative errors.

With the standard data sets that contain continuous varaiables the error of the tree is not significantly different from the more standard heuristic. In contrast, the meteorlogical phenomena have more trees that are more accurate. The heuristic also discovers interactions that would not be found at the first passes of the multiple pass approach. A plausible explanation for the differences between the meteorological and the standard sets are given.

While functional decomposition was originally created for the minimization of logic circuits, this paper uses the decomposition process for both machine learning and logic synthesis of of multi-valued functions. As it turns out, the minimization of logic circuits can be used in the concept of "learning" in machine learning, by reducing the complexity of a given data set. A main difference is that machine learning problems normally have a large number of output don't cares. Thus, the decomposition technique presented in this paper is focused on functions with a large number of don't cares. There have been several papers that have discussed the topic of using multi-valued functional decomposition for functions with a large number of don't cares. The novelty brought with this paper is that the proposed method is structured to reduce the resulting "error" of the functional decomposer where "error" is a measure well a machine learning algorithm approximates the actual, or true function.

These authors explore the ideas of functional decomposition, but left the concepts of machine learning to the papers that they reference. In general, they never fully explain why a logic synthesis method should be applied to machine learning. This paper explores and presents the basic concepts of machine learning, and how some concepts match nicely with multi-valued logic synthesis, while others pose great difficulties. The main reason for using multi-valued synthesis is that many problems are naturally multi-valued (i.e., values taken from a discrete set). Thus, mapping the problem directly to a multi-valued set of inputs and outputs is much more natural than encoding the problem into a binary form. The paper also shows that any multi-valued logic synthesis method could be applied to the machine learning problem. But, this paper focuses on multi-valued functional decomposition because of its generality of minimizing a given data set.

In this paper, we investigate these issues via a software tool which can generate testability metrics and diagnostic information for analog circuits represented by SPICE descriptions. This tool, termed the Virtual Test-Bench (VTB), incorporates three different simulation-based techniques for fault detection and isolation. The first method is based on the creation of fault-test dependency models, while the other two techniques employ machine learning principles based on the concepts of: (1) Restricted Coloumb Energy (RCE) Neural Networks, and (2) Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). Whereas the output of the first method can be used for the traditional off-line diagnosis, the RCE and LVQ models render themselves more naturally to on-line monitoring, where measurement data from various sensors is continuously available. Since it is well known that analog faults and test measurements are affected by component parameter variations, we have also addressed the issues of robustness of our fault diagnosis schemes. Specifically, we have attempted to answer the questions regarding fixing of test measurement thresholds, obtaining the minimum number of Monte-Carlo runs required to stabilize the measurements and their deviations, and the effect of different thresholding schemes on the robustness of fault models. Although fault-simulation is a powerful technique for analog circuit testability analysis, its main shortcomings are the long simulation time, large volume of data and the fidelity of simulators in accurately modeling faults. have plotted the simulation time and volume of data required for a range of circuit sizes to provide guidance on the feasibility and efficacy of this approach.

The basic idea is to determine a set of most discriminative features by evaluating how well they perform on the task of classifying images according to predefined semantic categories. We propose this indirect method as a rigorous way to solve the difficult feature selection problem that comes zip in most content based image retrieval tasks. The method is applied to normal and pathological neuroradiological CT images, where we take advantage of the fact that normal human brains present an approximate bilateral symmetry which is often absent in pathological brains. The quantitative evaluation of the retrieval system shows promising results.

Indeed, many systems have a limited applicability because of their impossibility to deal with numerical data. In this paper, we propose an approach for learning definitions of concepts from their examples, in the presence of numerical but also uncertain data. This approach fits in a First Order Logic framework and its main characteristics are: (1) the use of fuzzy sets to represent numerical data and model uncertain features, and (2) an inductive learning process based on Rough Set Theory which is capable of handling uncertainty within the learning data. Compared to classical symbolic approaches to inductive learning, it differs in two main points: firstly, it becomes possible to represent both sharp and flexible concepts, and secondly the definitions of concepts that are learned are not deterministic but fuzzy. This approach has been implemented through the EAGLE system and evaluated on a real-world problem of organic chemistry. The results obtained show its good potentialities.

Automatic generation of fuzzy rules from data sets, using machine learning techniques, can generate significant number of redundant and inconsistent rules. In this short study we have shown that it is possible to provide a systematic approach to understand the fuzzy rule inconsistency problem by using the proposed measure called the Commonality measure. Apart from introducing this measure, this paper describes an algorithm to optimize a fuzzy rule base using it. The optimization procedure performs elimination of redundant and/or inconsistent fuzzy rules from a rule base.

To implement this capability we adopt an inductive learning method of conceptual formation for adaptively organizing a state space and develop a new algorithm for a robot to construct its task-relevant state space efficiently through matching encountering states with the similar situations in the past and through generalizing them. We propose a methodology to dynamically increase thf: resolution of state spaces both adaptively and selectively by applying a concept formation technique from machine learning in a recursive fashion to a record of a sensorimotor history of a learning agent. By connecting this with the conventional reinforcement learning, we showed our algorithm can perform tasks without suffering from hidden state problems in an artificial maze environment and also present its robustness even for a robot whose perceptual resources are quite restricted and/or bounded.

The proposed approach consists of two phases: knowledge encoding and knowledge integrating. In the encoding phase, each rule in the rule set is first encoded as a rule bit-string. The combined bit strings from multiple rule sets thus form an initial knowledge population. In the knowledge integration phase, a genetic algorithm generates an optimal or nearly optimal rule set from these initial rule sets. Experiments on diagnosing brain tumors were made to compare the accuracy of a rule set generated by the proposed approach with that of the initial rule sets derived from different groups of experts or induced by various machine learning techniques. Results show that the rule set derived by the proposed approach is much more accurate than each initial rule set on its own.

However, the effectiveness of these systems is dependent on preserved residual movements or speech. In the absence of means to repair the damaged nervous system, three options exist for restoring function: 1) augmenting the capabilities of remaining pathways, 2) detouring around points of damage, or 3) providing the brain with new channels for communication and control. This paper reviews the use of machine learning methods for development of assistive technology. Three projects are described, representing the three options listed above. In each of them machine learning methods are employed to help with pattern recognition and classification. I) Automatic speech recognition of dysarthric speech: Available speech recognition tools are usually directed toward productivity tasks and are limited to normal speech. Those with severe speech impairments, who need help with communication and control functions find these tools ineffective. We have designed a speaker-dependent speech recognition system which can be trained and incorporated into communication, control and computer access interfaces for those with severe neuromuscular and speech impairments. The system, which can be customized for a particular speaker, is based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients and discrete hidden Markov modelling (HMM). II) Control strategies far FES-assisted locomotion (Functional Electrical Stimulation): Control of FES-assisted locomotion for people with incomplete spinal cord injury is a difficult task because it has to integrate external excitation of paralyzed muscles with preserved functionality of other parts of the body and impaired biomechanics. We have designed a non-parametric control of FES at the co-ordination level using adaptive logic networks (ALNs) for cloning control skill, which can be a part of a natural or learned control system. The system presented here is based on artificial sensors installed externally. III) An EEG-based computer access: ALNs are trained to recognize voluntary modulated patterns encoded in brain's electrical activity. The final goal of this technology is to provide a new communication and control channel for people with most severe neuromuscular and speech impairments. ALN training occurs at the same time as the person learns how to modulate his or her EEG-signals. A successful control of cursor movements on the computer screen is reported. Although these three projects may look very different from each other, the structure of their experimental set-ups, and their potential for application in assistive devices are very similar. Ail experimental set-ups consist of sensory signal acquisition, signal processing for feature extraction, and data processing by machine learning techniques for pattern recognition and classification. In addition, all three projects deal with digital signal processing and machine learning method applications in development of man-machine interface.

These metaphors have been successfully applied to the complex real world problem of mortgage fraud detection, using a learning system known as Jisys. The Jisys system identifies patterns in mortgage fraud data by constructing an immune network, which is then evolved through the analysis of additional fraudulent and non-fraudulent applications. By viewing this network, a human expert can gain a better understanding of the fraudulent behavior. This paper describes significant developments over the original Jisys system. For example, the network is currently a nat structure with significant groupings within it. However, it can be difficult to identify these groups, to analyse them and then determine their significance. This paper describes some advances, which significantly improve the interpretation of the network, We also consider various statistical techniques which can be used to enhance the performance of the Jisys system as well as exploiting inherent properties of the network, which enable significant performance improvements to be implemented (with not loss of information content).

For ACLS experiments, we revise the ACLS, which pruning methods - cost complexity pruning, reduced error pruning, pessimistic error pruning, and production rule are incorporated into. For neural networks experiments, we conduct experiments for two cases: one is for using the original whole data. We call it the conventional neural networks (CNN). This CNN approach is to categorize a new instance as one of me predefined bond classes, but it has limitations in dealing with the ordinal nature of bond rating problem and as the number of classes to be recognized increases, the predictive performance decreases. To alleviate such difficulties, we partition the original whole data in a pairwise manner for training the neural networks. We call it partitioned neural networks (PNN). Experimental results show that the predictive performance of PNN is best among other machine learning methods as well as statistical methods. The PNN has two computational methods and we discuss under which circumstances one method performs better.

The problem,vith using color is that its representation is low level and hence its retrieval effectiveness is limited. This paper investigates techniques to improving the effectiveness of image retrieval based on colors. It examines the choice of suitable color space and color resolution. It describes two techniques for image retrieval with relevance feedback (RF). The first uses machine learning algorithms to extract significant color intervals and build the decision tree from the relevant image set to support effective RF. The second employs color coherent vector (CCV), in which the pseudo object information encoded in CCV is rued for RF Both techniques have been tested on a large image database containing over 12, 000 images. Tests were also performed to evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval at different color resolutions The results demonstrate that our RF techniques are effective and a medium color resolution of 176 colors performs the best.

This paper presents a novel method for recognising machine printed characters and character images using functional decomposition. The methods found in literature [9][20] try to find some characteristics of an image and apply different computational intelligence techniques to match them to a character. Each character or image is viewed as set of conditions with a corresponding set of decisions. This paper shows functional decomposition [4][6] as a tool in determining the characters by considering less number of conditions. Moreover, the structures produced by functional decomposition are easily implementable by FPGAs and therefore can be quickly reconfigured to suit a different set of characters. The problem of character recognition is analogous to decision making in information systems. The decision table (DT) generated from a set of characters is functionally decomposed and intermediate decision rules are generated. The advantage of the proposed method is in the analysis of the character recognition process using the intermediate conditions and decisions.

Since centralized systems may have a great impact on the system performance, parallel and distribution techniques are needed for attaining scalability. Distributed databases are, then, crucial for the development of cooperative applications. However, in order to improve performance, it is very important to design information distribution properly, which is the goal of Distribution Design. Considering the various difficulties embedded in the Design of Distributed Object Oriented Databases, this work presents an algorithm to assist distribution designers in their task. The analysis algorithm indicates the most adequate fragmentation technique (vertical, horizontal or mixed) for each class in the database schema, and we propose the use of a machine learning method - inductive Logic Programming - to uncover some implicit issues to be considered in the distribution design, thus revising the proposed analysis algorithm.

A classification tree. developed using a machine learning algorithm, indicates that the candidates for chronic use of FES are patients with weak ankle dorsiflexors and sufficently strong knee extensors. For these patients, FES of ankle plantar flexors applied during the toe-off phase can shorten the walking cycle duration and increase the angular excursions of the hip, knee, and ankle joint.

Machine learning presents a promising approach to this problem in the form of systems that automatically adapt their behavior to accommodate different users. In this paper, we present an empirical study of learning user models in an adaptive assistant for crisis scheduling. We describe the problem domain and the scheduling assistant, then present an initial formulation of the adaptive assistant's learning task and the results of a baseline study. After this, we report the results of three subsequent experiments that investigate the effects of problem reformulation and representation augmentation. The results suggest that problem reformulation leads to significantly better accuracy without sacrificing the usefulness of the learned behavior. The studies also raise several interesting issues in adaptive assistance for scheduling.

Hep-2 cells allow recognition of over 30 different nuclear and cytoplasmic patterns, which are given by upwards of 100 different autoantibodies. The identification of the patterns is recently done manually by a human inspecting the slides with a microscope. In the paper, we present first results on image analysis, feature extraction and classification. Starting from a knowledge acquisition process with a human operator we developed image analysis and feature extraction algorithm. A data set containing 112 features for each entry was set up and given to machine learning techniques to find out the relevant features among this large feature set and to construct the structure of the classifier The classifier was evaluated by crossvalidation method. The results are good and show the feasibility of an automatic inspection system.

Decision fusion can also improve recognition accuracy of a single classifier that uses several independent features. These features may reflect various properties of the objects, be obtained from different types of sensors, spectral components of multi-spectral images, or represent observations for different parts of environment. In these cases we can apply the classifier to each independent type of features and make the final decision based on decision combination. This paper presents a general approach to decision fusion for machine learning based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, implementation of this approach in different learning paradigms, and experiments with application of this decision fusion process to learning in distributed systems.

A decision table consists of a hierarchical table in which each entry in a higher level table gets broken down by the values of a pair of additional attributes to form another table. The structure is similar to dimensional stacking [4]. Presented here is a visualization method that allows a model based on many attributes to be understood even by those unfamiliar with machine learning.

To support these activities we propose to integrate machine learning and,workflow management. This enables an inductive approach to workflow acquisition and adaptation by processing traces of manually enacted workflows. We present a machine learning component that combines two different machine learning algorithms. In this paper we focus mainly on the first one which induces the structure of the workflow: based on the induction of hidden markov models. The second algorithm, a standard decision rule induction algorithm, induces transition conditions. The main concepts have been implemented in a prototype, which we have validated using artificial process traces. The induced workflow models can be imported by the business process management system ADONIS(1).

J	Hexmoor, H; Meeden, L; Murphy, RR				Hexmoor, H; Meeden, L; Murphy, RR			Is robot learning a new subfield? - The Robolearn-96 workshop	AI MAGAZINE			English	Editorial Material								This article posits the idea of robot learning as a new subfield. The results of the Robolearn-96 Workshop provide evidence that learning in modern robotics is distinct from traditional machine learning. The article examines the role of robotics in the social and natural sciences and the potential impact of learning on robotics, generating both a continuum of research issues and a description of the divergent terminology, target domains, and standards of proof associated with robot learning. The article argues that although robot learning is a new subfield, there is significant potential for synergy with traditional machine learning if the differences in research cultures can be overcome.

J	Abdel-Aal, RE; Mangoud, AM				Abdel-Aal, RE; Mangoud, AM			Modeling obesity using abductive networks	COMPUTERS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						obesity; waist-to-hip ratio; modeling; prediction; abductive networks; machine learning	BODY-FAT DISTRIBUTION; DEPENDENT DIABETES-MELLITUS; ADIPOSE-TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; WEIGHT-REDUCTION; PLASMA-LIPIDS; FOLLOW-UP; RISK; DIAGNOSIS	This paper investigates the use of abductive-network machine learning for modeling and predicting outcome parameters in terms of input parameters in medical survey data. Here we consider modeling obesity as represented by the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) risk factor to investigate the influence of various parameters. The same approach would be useful in predicting values of clinical parameters that are difficult or expensive to measure from others that are more readily available. The AIM abductive network machine learning tool was used to model the WHR from 13 other health parameters. Survey data were collected for a randomly selected sample of 1100 persons aged 20 yr and over attending nine primary health care centers at Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. Models were synthesized by training on a randomly selected set of 800 cases, using both continuous and categorical representations of the parameters, and evaluated by predicting the WHR value for the remaining 300 cases. Models for WHR as a continuous variable predict the actual values within an error of 7.5% at the 90% confidence limits. Categorical models predict the correct logical value of WHR with an error in only 2 of the 300 evaluation cases. Analytical relationships derived from simple categorical models explain global observations on the total survey population to an accuracy as high as 99%. Simple continuous models represented as analytical functions highlight global relationships and trends. Results confirm the strong correlation between WHR and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, and family history of obesity. Compared to other statistical and neural network approaches, AIM abductive networks provide faster and more automated model synthesis. A review is given of other areas where the proposed modeling approach can be useful in clinical practice. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

J	Ishibuchi, H; Nakashima, T; Murata, T				Ishibuchi, H; Nakashima, T; Murata, T			Comparison of the Michigan and Pittsburgh approaches to the design of fuzzy classification systems	ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN PART III-FUNDAMENTAL ELECTRONIC SCIENCE			English	Article						Fuzzy classification system; rule selection; Michigan approach; Pittsburgh approach	GENETIC ALGORITHMS; RULES	Fuzzy systems based on fuzzy if-then rules have been applied to various problems. The main application area has been fuzzy control problems. In many cases, such fuzzy systems can handle only a few input variables. This is because the number of fuzzy if-then rules exponentially increases as the number of input variables increases. In this gaper, we try to design fuzzy classification systems based on fuzzy if-then rules for multidimensional pattern classification problems with many attributes. For designing such fuzzy classification systems, we compare two frameworks in the area of genetics-based machine learning: the Michigan approach and the Pittsburgh approach. The performance of fuzzy rule-based classification systems is also compared with that of various pattern classification methods. In computer simulations, we use a wine classification problem with 13 attributes, a cancer diagnosis problem with 9 attributes, and a credit approval problem with 14 attributes.

Algorithms	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article						Melanie; computer analysis; two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; image processing; spot detection		After two generations of software systems for the analysis of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) images, a third generation of such software packages has recently emerged that combines state-of-the-art graphical user interfaces with comprehensive spot data analysis capabilities. A key characteristic common to most of these software packages is that many of their tools are implementations of algorithms that resulted from research areas such as image processing, vision, artificial intelligence or machine learning. This article presents the main algorithms implemented in the Melanie II 2-D PAGE software package. The applications of these algorithms, embodied as the feature of the program, are explained in an accompanying article (R. D. Appel et al.; Electrophoresis 1997, 18, 2724-2734).

J	Vohradsky, J				Vohradsky, J			Adaptive classification of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic spot patterns by neural networks and cluster analysis	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article						two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; neural networks; cluster analysis; principal component analysis; streptomycetes	SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; STREPTOMYCES-COELICOLOR; 2-D ELECTROPHORESIS; WHEAT-VARIETIES; GLOBAL CHANGES; EXPRESSION; PROTEINS; DATABASE; IDENTIFICATION; COMPUTER	The interpretation of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis spot profiles can be facilitated by statistical and machine learning programs. Two different approaches to classification of spot profiles - cluster analysis and neural networks - are discussed. Neural networks for two different model patterns were designed and an algorithm for training of the net for the classification was developed. It was shown that the performance of neural networks is higher compared to cluster and principal component analysis. The possibility of combining both approaches into one process can increase reliability and speed of classification. Artificially created training sets with added random noise can be used for network training. The analysis was applied on the Streptomyces coelicolor developmental two-dimensional (2-D) gel database.

The goal is to produce a classification function that has higher accuracy than either the expert's hypotheses or the classification function inductively learned from the training examples alone. The key idea in our proposed approach is to let the expert's hypotheses influence the process of learning inductively from the training examples. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the power of our approach in a variety of domains.

Although this paper focuses on inductive learning, it at least touches on a great many aspects of ML in general. In addition, incremental induction is also reviewed. Therefore, a general review of ML is presented, but specific detail which has been covered previously is omitted, although other relevant references are noted, and later material is commented upon.

Map recovery takes place through interaction between the robot and the world, in which either sensing and acting are affected by uncertainty. Kalman filtering is applied to maintain position best estimates, which are then fused with data coming from the observation of landmarks. The proposed method has been implemented on a robot equipped with ultrasonic range finders, and tested in a fairly simple, real environment.

To test this a domain was selected for which knowledge based systems had a high performance: intelligent alarm systems. A mathematical model of a breathing circuit and ventilated patient was implemented in PSpice(R). Airway pressure, gas flows and CO2 concentration were simulated with this model, during normal functioning of the breathing circuit and during several mishaps, for a wide range of simulated patients. With an inductive machine learning program, classification trees were created from the simulated patient data. The classification trees described each breathing circuit mishap in terms of changes in signal feature values with respect to the normal situation and were implemented as alarm system knowledge bases. The alarm systems were tested with data measured at 17 mechanically ventilated animals. During ventilation of the animals several mishaps were introduced. For each animal, 93-100% of all mishaps could be detected correctly by the alarm systems. The false alarm rate ranged on average from one false alarm per h to one false alarm every 2.5 h. It was concluded that the suggested approach to knowledge elicitation was successful. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

J	AbdelAal, RE; AlGarni, AZ				AbdelAal, RE; AlGarni, AZ			Forecasting monthly electric energy consumption in eastern Saudi Arabia using univariate time-series analysis	ENERGY			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL	Univariate Box-Jenkins time-series analysis has been used for modeling and forecasting monthly domestic electric energy consumption in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed using data for 5 yr and evaluated on forecasting new data for the sixth year. The optimum model derived is a multiplicative combination of seasonal and nonseasonal autoregressive parts, each being of the first order, following first differencing at both the seasonal and nonseasonal levels. Compared to regression and abductive network machine-learning models previously developed on the same data, ARIMA models require less data, have fewer coefficients, and are more accurate. The optimum ARIMA model forecasts monthly data for the evaluation year with an average percentage error of 3.8% compared to 8.1% and 5.6% for the best multiple-series regression and abductory induction mechanism (AIM) models, respectively; the mean-square forecasting error is reduced with the ARIMA model by factors of 3.2 and 1.6, respectively.

This has led to the birth of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining-a process that has the goal to selectively extract knowledge from data. A range of techniques, including neural networks, rule-based systems, case-based reasoning, machine learning, statistics, etc. can be applied to the problem. We discuss the use of concept lattices, to determine dependences in the data mining process. We first define concept lattices, after which we show how they represent knowledge and how they are formed from raw data. Finally, we show how the lattice-based technique addresses different processes in KDD, especially visualization and navigation of discovered knowledge. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The aims of data mining, and some of its methods, overlap with those of classical statistics. However, there are some philosophical and methodological differences. We examine these differences, and we describe three approaches to machine learning that have developed largely independently: classical statistics, Vapnik's statistical learning theory, and computational learning theory. Comparing these approaches, we conclude that statisticians and data miners can profit by studying each other's methods and using a judiciously chosen combination of them.

When there are many attributes in the data, one needs to know which of the attribute(s) are relevant for modelling the target, either as a group or the one feature that is most appropriate to select within the model construction process in progress. There are many approaches for selecting the attribute(s) in machine learning. We examine various important concepts and approaches that are used for this purpose and contrast their strengths. Discretization of numeric attributes is also discussed for its use is prevalent in many modelling techniques.

Of methods for classification and regression that have been developed in the fields of pattern recognition, statistics, and machine learning, these are of particular interest for data mining since they utilize symbolic and interpretable representations. Symbolic solutions can provide a high degree of insight into the decision boundaries that exist in the data, and the logic underlying them. This aspect makes these predictive-mining techniques particularly attractive in commercial and industrial data-mining applications.

J	Craven, MW; Shavlik, JW				Craven, MW; Shavlik, JW			Using neural networks for data mining	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; neural networks; rule extraction; comprehensible models; decision trees; perceptrons		Neural networks have been successfully applied in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications. Neural-network methods are not commonly used for data-mining tasks, however, because they often produce incomprehensible models and require long training times. In this article, we describe neural-network learning algorithms that are able to produce comprehensible models, and that do not require excessive training times. Specifically, we discuss two classes of approaches for data mining with neural networks. The first type of approach, often called rule extraction, involves extracting symbolic models from trained neural networks. The second approach is to directly learn simple, easy-to-understand networks. We argue that, given the current state-of-the-art, neural-network methods deserve a place in the tool boxes of data-mining specialists.

J	Wong, AKC; Wang, Y				Wong, AKC; Wang, Y			High-order pattern discovery from discrete-valued data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						adjusted residual; attributed hypergraph; data analysis; database mining; machine learning; pattern discovery; pattern representation	KNOWLEDGE; INDUCTION	To uncover qualitative and quantitative patterns in a data set is a challenging task for research in the area of machine learning and data analysis. Due to the complexity of real-world data, high-order (polythetic) patterns or event associations, in addition to first-order class-dependent relationships, have to be acquired. Once the patterns of different orders are found, they should be represented in a form appropriate for further analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel method to discover qualitative and quantitative patterns (or event associations) inherent in a data set. It uses the adjusted residual analysis in statistics to test the significance of the occurrence of a pattern candidate against its expectation. To avoid exhaustive search of all possible combinations of primary events, techniques of eliminating the impossible pattern candidates are developed. The detected patterns of different orders are then represented in an attributed hypergraph which is lucid for pattern interpretation and analysis. Test results on artificial and real-world data are discussed toward the end of the paper.

We first discuss a conditional rule generation technique (CRG) that is designed to describe structures using part attributes and their relations. We then show how the resultant rules can be used for region labeling and examine constraint propagation techniques for improving rule-based object classification.

J	Mascarilla, L				Mascarilla, L			Fuzzy rules extraction and redundancy elimination: An application to remote sensing image analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th European Congress on Intelligent Techniques and Soft Computing (EUFIT 96)	SEP   04, 1996	AACHEN, GERMANY				DECISION-MAKING	Regarding remote sensing images analysis viewed as a pattern recognition problem, one has to take into account numeric and symbolic knowledge about searched classes and objects. Firstly we briefly describe an expert system approach for image classification according to expert knowledge about best sites for vegetation classes in terms of out-image data (D.E.M.,dagger soils, hydrological network, roads, villages...). In this framework of an image interpretation system for automatic cartography based on remote sensing image classification improved by a photo interpreter knowledge, we developed a machine learning system based on neural networks which simultaneously produce fuzzy rules, with their linguistic approximation, and a final classification. This article investigates the application of mutual information criterion to simplify fuzzy rules namely to select an informative subset of premises out of an initial set. A vegetation classification experiment (made according to generated rules before and after the simplification process) with a satellite image will be presented. We conclude by summing up the various aspects of fuzzy theory used in our application. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The characteristics are identified from the descriptions of 23 IR systems. Four IR models are discussed: the Boolean model, the vector model, the probabilistic model and the connectionistic model. Twelve other characteristics of IR models are identified: search intermediary, domain knowledge, relevance feedback, natural language interface, graphical query language, conceptual queries, full-text IR, field searching, fuzzy queries, hyptertext integration, machine learning, and ranked output. Finally, the relevance of IR systems for the World Wide Web is established. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	King, RD; Srinivasan, A				King, RD; Srinivasan, A			The discovery of indicator variables for QSAR using inductive logic programming	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN			English	Article						artificial intelligence; machine learning; regression	AUTOMATED STRUCTURE EVALUATION; DIHYDROFOLATE-REDUCTASE; NEURAL NETWORKS; RODENT CARCINOGENICITY; TRIMETHOPRIM; INHIBITION; TRIAZINES; MOLECULES; ALGORITHM; BINDING	A central problem in forming accurate regression equations in QSAR studies is the selection of appropriate descriptors for the compounds under study. We describe a novel procedure for using inductive logic programming (ILP) to discover new indicator variables (attributes) for QSAR problems, and show that these improve the accuracy of the derived regression equations. ILP techniques have previously been shown to work well on drug design problems where there is a large structural component or where clear comprehensible rules are required. However, ILP techniques have had the disadvantage of only being able to make qualitative predictions e.g. active, inactive) and not to predict real numbers (regression). We unify ILP and linear regression techniques to give a QSAR method that has the strength of ILP at describing steric structure, with the familiarity and power of linear regression. We evaluated the utility of this new QSAR technique by examining the prediction of biological activity with and without the addition of new structural indicator variables formed by ILP. In three out of five datasets examined the addition of ILP variables produced statistically better results (P<0.01) over the original description. The new ILP variables did not increase the overall complexity of the derived QSAR equations and added insight into possible mechanisms of action. We conclude that ILP can aid in the process of drug design.

The modelled development process involves (simulated) processes of evolution, learning and representation development. The main value of the model is that it provides an illustration of how simple learning processes may lead to the formation of structures which can be given a representational interpretation. It also shows how these may form the infrastructure for closely-coupled agent/environment interaction.

J	Sethi, IK; Yoo, JH				Sethi, IK; Yoo, JH			Structure-driven induction of decision tree classifiers through neural learning	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						decision trees; machine learning; multifeature splits; neural networks; neural trees; structured induction	DESIGN; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION	The decision tree classifiers represent a nonparametric classification methodology that is equally popular in pattern recognition and machine learning. Such classifiers are also popular in neural networks under the label of neural trees. This paper presents a new approach for designing these classifiers. Instead of following the common top-down approach to generate a decision tree, a structure-driven approach for induction of decision trees, SDIDT, is proposed. In this approach, a tree structure of fixed size with empty internal nodes, i.e. nodes without any splitting function, and labeled terminal nodes is first assumed. Using a collection of training vectors of known classification, a neural learning scheme combining backpropagation and soft competitive learning is then used to simultaneously determine the splits for each decision tree node. The advantage of the SDIDT approach is that it generates compact trees that have multifeature splits at each internal node which are determined on global rather than local basis; consequently it produces decision trees yielding better classification and interpretation of the underlying relationships in the data. Several well-known examples of data sets of different complexities and characteristics are used to demonstrate the strengths of the SDIDT method. (C) 1997 Pattern Recognition Society.

APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)	JUL, 1996	BARI, ITALY					Implementation of machine learning (ML) in human-computer interaction (HCI) work is not trivial. This article reports on a survey of 112 professionals and academicians specializing in HCI, who were asked to state level of ML use in HCI work. Responses were captured via a structured questionnaire. Analysis showed that about one-third of those who participated in the survey had used ML in conjunction with a variety of different HCI tasks. However, statistically significant differences could not be identified between those who have and those who have not used ML. Using statistics, contingency analysis, and clustering, we modeled interaction between representative HCI tasks and ML paradigms. We discovered that neural networks, rule induction, and statistical learning emerged as the most popular ML paradigms across HCI workers, although intensive learning, such as inductive logic programming, are gaining popularity among application developers. We also discovered that the leading causes for declining use of ML in HCI work are (I) misperceptions about ML, (2) lack of awareness of ML's potential, and (3) scarcity of concrete case studies demonstrating the application of ML in HCI.

APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)	JUL, 1996	BARI, ITALY				USER MODELS	One problem facing designers of interactive systems is catering to the wide range of users who will use a particular application. Understanding the user is critical to designing a usable interface. There are a number of ways of addressing addressing this problem, including improved design methodologies using ''intuitive'' interface styles, adaptive interfaces, and better training and user support materials. In this article, we argue that each of these solutions involves pattern recognition in one form or another and that machine learning can therefore aid designers of interactive systems in these areas. We report on experiments that demonstrate the potential of machine learning to user modeling that has application to two of these areas in particular: adaptive systems and design methodologies.

Indeed, the user of the system needs a support to the interpretation of maps, that is, a tool that segments maps and automatically associates geometric regions on a map with those semantic labels useful for applying hints and advices suggested by the environmental planning system. In the article, we present the application of symbolic machine learning techniques to the interpretation of maps. Two inductive learning systems, namely, INDUBI/CSL and ATRE, have been used to complete the knowledge base of an expert system Sor environmental planning. The application described concerns the recognition of four environmental concepts that are relevant for environmental protection. The positive results obtained in two different experiments prove the strength of the adopted approach for the interpretation task.

In this article, we review the slate of the art and discuss two complementary aspects of the role machine learning plays in HRC. First, we show how communication itself can benefit from learning, e.g., by building human-understandable symbols from a robot's perceptions and actions. Second, we investigate the power of nonverbal communication and imitation learning mechanisms for robot programming.

Like its human counterpart, an expert system gives advice by drawing upon its own store of knowledge, and by requesting information related to the problem at hand. In this study, a knowledge based expert system, PILOT, was designed to assist user for both selecting the proper inventory model based on the user's interest and computing the critical values of the selected inventory model in an interactive mode. The inventory models considered were deterministic single item inventory models with various cases. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Most of the existing methods in literature are based on crisp concepts that are weak in handling marginal cases. In this paper, we present a fuzzy inductive learning method that integrates the fuzzy set theory into the regular inductive learning processes. The method converts a decision tree induced from regular method into a fuzzy decision tree in which hurdle values for splitting branches and classes associated with leaves are fuzzy. Results from empirical tests indicate that the new fuzzy approach outperforms the popular discriminant analysis and ID3 in predictive accuracy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Zhang, BT; Ohm, P; Muhlenbein, H				Zhang, BT; Ohm, P; Muhlenbein, H			Evolutionary neural trees for modeling and predicting complex systems	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						evolutionary algorithms; neurocomputing; evolutionary neural trees; machine learning; system identification; complex systems; time series prediction		Modeling and predicting the behavior of many technical systems is complicated because they are generally characterized by a large number of variables, parameters and interactions, and limited amounts of collected data. This paper investigates an evolutionary method for learning models of such systems. The models thus evolved are based on trees of heterogeneous neural units. The set of different neuron types is defined by the application domain, and the specific type of each unit is determined during the evolutionary learning process. The structure, size, and weights of the neural trees are also adapted by evolution. Since the genetic search used for training does nor require error derivatives, a wide range of neural models can be constructed. This generality is contrasted with various existing methods for complex system modeling, which investigate only restricted topological subsets rather than the complete class of architectures. An improvement in the predictive accuracy and parsimony of models is reported, against backpropagation networks and other well-engineered polynomial-based methods for two problems: MacKey-Glass and Lorenz-like chaotic systems. The authors also demonstrate the importance of the selection pressure towards model parsimony for the improvement of prediction accuracy. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Recently several active research projects on machine learning have been undertaken from the viewpoint of knowledge-based management. The aim of this study is to develop the Concrete Bridge Rating (Diagnosis) Prototype Expert System with machine learning, employing the combination of a neural network and bidirectional associative memories (BAM). The introduction of machine learning into this system facilitates knowledge-based refinement. By applying the system to an actual in-service bridge, it has been verified that the machine learning method employed that uses the results of questionnaire surveys involving bridge experts is effective for the system.

The robots interact within a world of objects, and obstacles, performing tasks robustly, while improving their performance through learning. The adaptive control of the robots has been achieved by a novel control system. The Tropism-based cognitive architecture for the individual behavior of robots in a colony is demonstrated through experimental investigation of the robot colony. This architecture is based on representation of the likes and dislikes of the robots. It is shown that the novel architecture is not only robust, but also provides the robots with intelligent adaptive behavior. This objective is achieved by utilization of three different techniques of neural networks, machine learning, and genetic algorithms. Each of these methodologies are applied to the tropism architecture, resulting in improvements in the task performance of the robot team, demonstrating the adaptability and robustness of the proposed control system.

LAD was originally developed for analyzing binary data by using the theory of partially defined Boolean functions, An extension of LAD for the analysis of numerical data sets is achieved through the process of ''binarization'' consisting in the replacement of each numerical variable by binary ''indicator'' variables, each showing whether the value of the original variable is above or below a certain level. Binarization was successfully applied to the analysis of a variety of real life data sets, This paper develops the theoretical foundations of the binarization process studying the combinatorial optimization problems related to the minimization of the number of binary variables, To provide an algorithmic framework for the practical solution of such problems, we construct compact linear integer programming formulations of them. We develop polynomial time algorithms for some of these minimization problems, and prove NP-hardness of others, (C) 1997 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Huang, XQ; Jensen, JR				Huang, XQ; Jensen, JR			A machine-learning approach to automated knowledge-base building for remote sensing image analysis with GIS data	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEM; SPATIAL DATA; CLASSIFICATION; INTEGRATION; LANDSAT; CATTAIL; MODELS	A machine learning approach to automated building of knowledge bases for image analysis expert systems incorporating GIS data is presented. The method uses an inductive learning algorithm to generate production rules from training data. With this method, building a knowledge base for a rule-based expert system is easier than using the conventional knowledge acquisition approach. The knowledge base built by this method was used by an expert system to perform a wetland classification of Par Pond on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina using SPOT multispectral imagery and GIS data. To evaluate the performance of the resultant knowledge base, the classification result was compared to classifications with two conventional methods. The accuracy assessment and the analysis of the resultant production rules suggest that the knowledge base built by the machine learning method was of good quality for image analysis with GIS data.

J	Loh, WY; Shih, YS				Loh, WY; Shih, YS			Split selection methods for classification trees	STATISTICA SINICA			English	Article						decision trees; discriminant analysis; machine learning	REGRESSION TREES	Classification trees based on exhaustive search algorithms tend to be biased towards selecting variables that afford more splits. As a result, such trees should be interpreted with caution. This article presents an algorithm called QUEST that has negligible bias. its split selection strategy shares similarities with the FACT method, but it yields binary splits and the final tree can be selected by a direct stopping rule or by pruning. Real and simulated data are used to compare QUEST with the exhaustive search approach. QUEST is shown to be substantially faster and the size and classification accuracy of its trees are typically comparable to those of exhaustive search.

J	Mitchell, TM				Mitchell, TM			Does machine learning really work?	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article							ALGORITHMS	Does machine learning really work? Yes. Over the past decade, machine learning has evolved from a field of laboratory demonstrations to a field of significant commercial value. Machine-learning algorithms have now learned to detect credit card fraud by mining data on past transactions, learned to steer vehicles driving autonomously on public highways at 70 miles an hour, and learned the reading interests of many individuals to assemble personally customized electronic newspapers. A new computational theory of learning is beginning to shed light on fundamental issues, such as the trade-off among the number of training examples available, the number of hypotheses considered, and the likely accuracy of the learned hypothesis. Newer research is beginning to explore issues such as long-term learning of new representations, the integration of Bayesian inference and induction, and life-long cumulative learning. This article, based on the keynote talk presented at the Thirteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, samples a number of recent accomplishments in machine learning and looks at where the field might be headed.

J	Ali, FOG; Wallace, WA				Ali, FOG; Wallace, WA			Bridging the gap between business objectives and parameters of data mining algorithms	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; data mining; managerial decision making; probabilistic inductive learning; business objectives; algorithm parameters		Data mining is being touted as having potential for discovering information that will contribute toward resolving business problems or creating business opportunities. However, before this potential can be realized, one needs to be able to relate the strategic objectives of a business to the use of the data mining technology. In this paper we focus on one aspect of that requirement, the translation of managerial goals into parameters of the algorithm being used to analyze the data. The first step in the process is to define a mapping from managerial goals to the performance measures of the algorithm. We then propose and apply an experimental approach using a classification algorithm, Probabilistic Inductive Learning, to develop a mapping between the performance measures and the parameters of the algorithm The experimental results are analyzed and guidelines are given for setting the bias of the algorithm to meet managerial goals. We conclude by recommending that an experimental analysis similar to what we proposed be conducted for all data mining algorithms and provided along with documentation as an aid to the user.

J	AbdelAal, RE; AlGarni, AZ; AlNassar, YN				AbdelAal, RE; AlGarni, AZ; AlNassar, YN			Modelling and forecasting monthly electric energy consumption in eastern Saudi Arabia using abductive networks	ENERGY			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORK; TEMPERATURE	Abductive network machine learning is proposed as an alternative to the conventional multiple regression analysis method for modelling and forecasting monthly electric energy consumption. The AIM (abductory induction mechanism) is used to model the domestic consumption in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia in terms of key weather parameters and demographic and economy indicators. Models are synthesized by training on data for 5 years and forecasting new data for the sixth year. Compared to regression models previously developed for the same data, AIM models require fewer input parameters, are more accurate and are easier and faster to develop. An AIM model that uses only the mean relative humidity and air temperature gives an average forecasting error of about 5.6% over the year. Our study demonstrates the advantage of using actual values for monthly average weather data rather than means of such averages over a few years. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Hong, SJ				Hong, SJ			R-MINI: An iterative approach for generating minimal rules from examples	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						classification; minimal rules; DNF; Occam's razor; generalization; specialization		Generating classification rules or decision trees from examples has been a subject of intense study in the pattern recognition community, the statistics community, and the machine-learning community of the artificial intelligence area. We pursue a point of view that minimality of rules is important, perhaps above all other considerations (biases) that come into play in generating rules. We present a new minimal rule-generation algorithm called R-MINI (Rule-MINI) that is an adaptation of a well-established heuristic-switching-function-minimization technique, MINI. The main mechanism that reduces the number of rules is repeated application of generalization and specialization operations to the rule set while maintaining completeness and consistency. R-MINI results on some benchmark cases are also presented.		Hong, SJ (reprint author), IBM CORP,DIV RES,THOMAS J WATSON RES CTR,YORKTOWN HTS,NY 10598, USA.

J	Doan, KPV; Wong, KP				Doan, KPV; Wong, KP			SHAPES: A novel approach for learning search heuristics in under-constrained optimization problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Explanation-Based Learning; heuristics; intractability; search; weight assignment	UNIT COMMITMENT; ALGORITHM	Although much research in machine learning has been carried out on acquiring knowledge for problem-solving in many problem domains, little effort has been focused on learning search-control knowledge for solving optimization problems. This paper reports on the development of SHAPES, a system that learns heuristic search guidance for solving optimization problems in intractable, under-constrained domains based on the Explanation-Based Learning (EEL) framework. The system embodies two new and novel approaches to machine learning. First, it makes use of explanations of varying levels of approximation as a mean for verifying heuristic-based decisions, allowing heuristic estimates to be revised and corrected during problem-solving. The provision of such a revision mechanism is particularly important when working in intractable and under-constrained domains, where heuristics tend to be highly over-generalized, and hence at times will give rise to incorrect results. Second, ii employs a new linear and quadratic programming-based weight-assignment algorithm formulated to direct search toward optimal solutions under best-first search. The algorithm offers a direct method for assigning rule strengths and, in so doing, avoids the need to address the credit-assignment problem faced by other iterative weight-adjustment methods.

J	Zhu, D; Prietula, MJ; Hsu, WL				Zhu, D; Prietula, MJ; Hsu, WL			When processes learn: Steps toward crafting an intelligent organization	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						information systems; organizational learning; artificial intelligence; machine learning	CONSTRAINT-SATISFACTION PROBLEMS; DECISION-MAKING; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; KNOWLEDGE; ALGORITHMS; MEMORY; DESIGN; MOLGEN	Two trends in information systems research provide an opportunity to add an additional link between information technology and organizational learning. First, there is an increasing penetration of information technology into the firm's processes and structures. Second, research in artificial intelligence has given rise to the first generation of fully computational architectures of general intelligence. In this research note we explore a melding of these two trends. In particular, we present the crafting of an organizational process which can learn, and develop and apply a new set of organizational learning metrics to that process. The process is a simplification of a complex, parallel-machine production scheduling task performed in a local manufacturing firm. The system Dispatcher-Soar, generally supports a symbolic, constraint propagation approach based, in part, on the reasoning methods of the human scheduler at the firm. The implementation of this process is based on a dispatching rule used by the expert. The behavior of Dispatcher-Soar centered around a small case study examining the effects of scheduling volume and learning on performance. Results indicated that the knowledge gained can reduce within-trial scheduling effort. An analysis of the generated knowledge structures (chunks) provided insight into how that learning was accomplished and contributed to process improvements. As the knowledge generated was in a form standardized to a common architecture, metrics were used to evaluate the production efficiency (eta(prod)), utility (eta(util)), and effectiveness (eta(eff)) Of the accumulated organizational knowledge across trials.

Investigation of both diagnoses and outcomes followed a late discovery of a misunderstanding between the knowledge engineers and the expert. The knowledge engineers had erroneously equated the expert's terms 'diagnosis' and 'outcome'. Following this discovery, two previously reported induced expert systems were re-evaluated using the more appropriate 'outcomes' and were found to be correct for 79 and 70% of all cases.

Of particular interest is the use of a recent ML technique (specifically CRG - Conditional Rule Generation) which generates descriptions of objects in terms of object parts and part-relational attribute bounds. We show how this technique can be combined with intensity-based model and scene-views to locate objects and their pose. The major contributions of this paper are: the extension of the CRG classifier to incorporate fuzzy decisions (FCRG), the application of the FCRG classifier to the problem of learning 3D objects from 2D intensity images, the study of the usefulness of sparse depth data in regards to recognition performance, and the implementation of a complete object recognition system that does not rely on perfect or synthetic data.

J	Ming, J; Bhanu, B				Ming, J; Bhanu, B			Oracle: An integrated learning approach for object recognition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						dynamic object model database; model acquisition and refinement; multi-strategy learning	MODELS	Model-based object recognition has become a popular paradigm in computer vision research. In most of the current model-based vision systems, the object models used for recognition are generally a priori given (e.g. obtained using a CAD model). For many object recognition applications, it is not realistic to utilize a fixed object model database with static model features. Rather, it is desirable to have a recognition system capable of performing automated object model acquisition and refinement. In order to achieve these capabilities, we have developed a system called ORACLE: Object Recognition Accomplished through Consolidated Learning Expertise. It uses two machine learning techniques known as Explanation-Based Learning (EEL) and Structured Conceptual Clustering (SCC) combined in a synergistic manner. As compared to systems which learn from numerous positive and negative examples, EEL allows the generalization of object model descriptions from a single example. Using these generalized descriptions, SCC constructs an efficient classification tree which is incremently built and modified over time. Learning from experience is used to dynamically update the specific feature values of each object. These capabilities provide a dynamic object model database which allows the system to exhibit improved performance over time. We provide an overview of the ORACLE system and present experimental results using a database of thirty aircraft models.

J	Lanubile, F; Visaggio, G				Lanubile, F; Visaggio, G			Evaluating predictive quality models derived from software measures: Lessons learned	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article							COMPONENTS; METRICS	This paper describes an empirical comparison of several modeling techniques for predicting the quality of software components early in the software life cycle. Using software product measures, we built models that classify components as high-risk, i.e., likely to contain faults, or low-risk, i.e., likely to be free of faults. The modeling techniques evaluated in this study include principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, logical classification models, layered neural networks, and holographic networks. These techniques provide a good coverage of the main problem-solving paradigms: statistical analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. Using the results of independent testing, we determined the absolute worth of the predictive models and compare their performance in terms of misclassification errors, achieved quality, and verification cost. Data came from 27 software systems, developed and tested during three years of project-intensive academic courses. A surprising result is that no model was able to effectively discriminate between components with faults and components without faults. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Forouraghi, B				Forouraghi, B			Inductive learning of materials performance indices from a material properties database	MATERIALS EVALUATION			English	Article						data mining; databases; decision tree classifiers; machine learning; material properties; nondestructive testing; software		Assessment of materials performance in engineering design and manufacturing is a complex process that requires significant knowledge of scientific and engineering principles. In a typical design application, for instance, determination of how a material's performance indices such as fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance, and formability are affected by its physical properties is a laborious task. Expert system technology has been able to partially address this issue by transferring domain specific expertise and heuristics from human experts into knowledge based systems that can precisely communicate materials knowledge to their users. Traditional expert systems, however, are limited from the standpoint that acquisition of their needed operational knowledge from human experts, who may not even exist in some particular applications, is a time consuming process which is at best subjective and prone to error. In this paper, we present a new approach where ID3-type decision tree classifiers extract the material selection knowledge from a properties database and present it to designers in the form of generalizations. One of the important features of decision trees is their ability to deal with unknown and/or imprecise training information. We also show how receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves can be used for describing the performance of a parametric family of decision tree classifiers.

Reactivity requires adaptively changing behaviour of a performance system that can best be supported by learning from experience. Reactive scheduling is considered in this paper with two options for reactive repair/proactive schedule adjustment to compensate for/prevent the effects of disturbances during the execution time of a current schedule. With a supervisory control perspective to shop floor operations, reactive scheduling of the two options above is embodied as one major intelligent supervisory function in a supervisory reactive scheduler SUPREACT and complemented by a cognitive learning approach to improve search space/control pattern-matching knowledge for guiding iterative schedule repair actions. In a brief overview, some learning approaches that comprise past experience for future re-use in reactive scheduling are referred to, The paper then presents a combined rule-and case-based reasoning/learning approach to opportunistic reactive scheduling based on a blackboard framework of the system's Expert Supervisor Unit, which also supports human integration into supervisory control of executed processes. Inherent learning ability of the case-based component allows to capture new schedule repair/search control knowledge, including also human preferences, and thus improve the system's reactive/proactive schedule repair efficiency in response to unexpected events/performance deterioration trends during the execution of predictive schedules in manufacturing shop floors.

J	Connolly, CI				Connolly, CI			Harmonic functions and collision probabilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH			English	Article							ROBOTS	There is a close relationship between harmonic functions-which have recently been proposed for path planning-and hitting probabilities for random processes. The hitting probabilities for random walks can be cast as a Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions, in much the same way as in path planning. This equivalence has implications both for uncertainty in motion planning and in the application of machine-learning techniques to some robot problems. In particular Erdmann's method can directly incorporate such hitting probabilities. In addition, the value functions obtained by reinforcement learning algorithms can be rapidly reconstructed by relaxation or resistive networks, once the extrema for such functions are known.

As an illustration we discuss the problem of designing MDL decision trees, which are meant to improve the earlier designs in two ways: First, by use of the sharper formula for the stochastic complexity at the nodes the earlier found tendency of getting too small trees appears to be overcome. Second, a dynamic programming-based pruning algorithm is described for finding the optimal trees, which generalizes an algorithm described in R. Nohre (Ph.D, thesis Linkoping University, 1994).

J	Baliga, G; Jain, S; Sharma, A				Baliga, G; Jain, S; Sharma, A			Learning from multiple sources of inaccurate data	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						inductive inference; machine learning; inaccurate data; multiple sources	INDUCTIVE INFERENCE; PROGRAM SYNTHESIS	Most theoretical models of inductive inference make the idealized assumption that the data available to a learner is from a single and accurate source. The subject of inaccuracies in data emanating from a single source has been addressed by several authors. The present paper argues in favor of a more realistic learning model in which data emanates from multiple sources, some or all of which may be inaccurate. Three kinds of inaccuracies are considered: spurious data (modeled as noisy texts), missing data (modeled as incomplete texts), and a mixture of spurious and missing data (modeled as imperfect texts). Motivated by the above argument, the present paper introduces and theoretically analyzes a number of inference criteria in which a learning machine is fed data from multiple sources, some of which may be infected with inaccuracies. The learning situation modeled is the identification in the limit of programs from graphs of computable functions. The main parameters of the investigation are: the kind of inaccuracy, the total number of data sources, the number of faulty data sources which produce data within an acceptable bound, and the bound on the number of errors allowed in the final hypothesis learned by the machine. Sufficient conditions are determined under which, for the same kind of inaccuracy, for the same bound on the number of errors in the final hypothesis, and for the same bound on the number of inaccuracies, learning from multiple texts, some of which may be inaccurate, is equivalent to learning from a single inaccurate text. The general problem of determining when learning from multiple inaccurate texts is a restriction over learning from a single inaccurate text turns out to be combinatorially Very complex. Significant partial results are provided for this problem. Several results are also provided about conditions under which the detrimental effects of multiple texts can be overcome by either allowing more errors in the final hypothesis or by reducing the number of inaccuracies in the texts. It is also shown that the usual hierarchies resulting from allowing extra errors in the final program (results in increased learning power) and allowing extra inaccuracies in the texts (results in decreased learning power) hold. Finally, it is demonstrated that in the context of learning from multiple inaccurate texts, spurious data is better than missing data, which in turn is better than a mixture of spurious and missing data.

The problem of finding information on the Internet has been replaced with the problem of knowing where search engines are, what they are designed to retrieve, and how to use them. This article describes and evaluates SavvySearch, a metasearch engine designed to intelligently select and interface with multiple remote search engines. The primary metasearch issue examined is the importance of carefully selecting and ranking remote search engines for user queries; We studied the efficacy of SavvySearch's incrementally acquired metaindex approach to selecting search engines by analyzing the effect of time and experience on performance. We also compared the metaindex approach to the simpler categorical approach and showed how much experience is required to surpass the simple scheme.

J	Kuo, T; Hwang, SY				Kuo, T; Hwang, SY			Using disruptive selection to maintain diversity in Genetic Algorithms	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						genetic algorithm; disruptive selection; diversity; nonstationary search problem; spike function		Genetic algorithms are a class of adaptive search techniques based on the principles of population genetics. The metaphor underlying genetic algorithms is that of natural evolution. With their great robustness, genetic algorithms have proven to be a promising technique for many optimization, design, control, and machine learning applications. A novel selection method, disruptive selection, has been proposed. This method adopts a nonmonotonic fitness function that is quite different from conventional monotonic fitness functions. Unlike conventional selection methods, this method favors both superior and inferior individuals. Since genetic algorithms allocate exponentially increasing numbers of trials to the observed better parts of the search space, it is difficult to maintain diversity in genetic algorithms. We show that Disruptive Genetic Algorithms (DGAs) effectively alleviate this problem by first demonstrating that DGAs can be used to solve a nonstationary search problem, where the goal is to track time-varying optima. Conventional Genetic Algorithms (CGAs) using proportional selection fare poorly on nonstationary search problems because of their lack of population diversity after convergence. Experimental results show that DGAs immediately track the optimum after the change of environment. We then describe a spike function that causes CGAs to miss the optimum. Experimental results show that DGAs outperform CGAs in resolving a spike function.

Thus a knowledge-lean methodology, as characterized by evolutionary models, seems suitable for non-routine design. However, evolutionary methods to date, as characterized by genetic algorithms (GAs), have been developed mainly for optimization and machine learning.

Three different parameters (current, mass, and resistance) are collected simultaneously. Then these laboratory measurements are used by an algorithm software as a logged data file, resulting in to inducing a decision tree. Later, a systematic software is designed based on the rules derived from this decision tree, to recognize the type of unknown solution used in the experiment. This is a new approach to data acquisition in chemical industries involving conducting polymers.

J	Baxter, J				Baxter, J			A Bayesian information theoretic model of learning to learn via multiple task sampling	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						hierarchical Bayesian inference; bias learning; feature learning; neural networks; information theory		A Bayesian model of learning to learn by sampling from multiple tasks is presented. The multiple tasks are themselves generated by sampling from a distribution over an environment of related tasks. Such an environment is shown to be naturally modelled within a Bayesian context by the concept of an objective prior distribution. It is argued that for many common machine learning problems, although in general we do not know the true (objective) prior for the problem, we do have some idea of a set of possible priors to which the true prior belongs. It is shown that under these circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In addition, bounds art given on the amount of information required to team a task when it is simultaneously learnt with several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little knowledge of the true prior, but the dimensionality of the true prior is small, then sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous. The theory is applied to the problem of learning a common feature set or equivalently a low-dimensional-representation (LDR) for an environment of related tasks.

The technique is based on ideas from machine learning. It forms first a set of finite-state automata describing the document completely. These automata are modified by considering certain context conditions; the modifications correspond to generalizing the underlying languages. Finally, the automata are converted into regular expressions, which are then used to construct the grammar. An alternative representation, characteristic k-grams, is also introduced. Additionally, the paper describes some interactive operations necessary for generating a grammar for a large and complicated document.

J	Schmidhuber, J				Schmidhuber, J			Discovering neural nets with low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Kolmogorov complexity; Levin complexity; Solomonoff-Levin distribution; generalization; universal search; self-sizing programs; neural networks	MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH; INFORMATION-THEORY; FRAMEWORK; PRINCIPLE; BIAS	Many neural net learning algorithms aim at finding ''simple'' nets to explain training data. The expectation is that the ''simpler'' the networks, the better the generalization on test data ( --> Occam's razor). Previous implementations, however use measures for ''simplicity'' that lack the power, universality and elegance of those based on Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff's algorithmic probability. Likewise, most previous approaches (especially those of the the ''Bayesian'' kind) suffer from the problem of choosing appropriate priors. This paper addresses both issues, It first reviews some basic concepts of algorithmic complexity theory relevant to machine learning, and how the Solomonoff-Levin distribution (or universal prior) deals with the prior problem. The universal prior leads to a probabilistic method for finding ''algorithmically simple'' problem solutions with high generalization capability. The method is based on Levin complexity (a time-bounded generalization of Kolmogorov complexity) and inspired by Levin's optimal universal search algorithm. For a given problem, solution candidates are computed by efficient ''self-sizing'' programs that influence their own runtime and storage size. The probabilistic search algorithm finds the ''good'' programs (the ones quickly computing algorithmically probable solutions fitting the training data). Simulations focus on the task of discovering ''algorithmically simple'' neural networks with low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability. It is demonstrated that the method, at least with certain toy problems where it is computationally feasible, can lead to generalization results unmatchable by previous neural network algorithms, Much remains to be done, however, to make large scale applications and ''incremental learning'' feasible.

As a case study we evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six ''real world'' medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for ''single number'' evaluation of machine learning algorithms. (C) 1997 Pattern Recognition Society.

In this study, axillary lymph node involvement was used as the standard against which prognostic estimations based on computer-derived nuclear features were gauged, METHODS, The prognostic significance of nuclear morphometric features determined by computer-based image analysis were analyzed in 198 consecutive preop preoperative samples obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) from patients with invasive breast carcinoma. A novel multivariate prediction method was used to model the time of distant recurrence as a function of the nuclear features. Prognostic predictions based on the nuclear feature data were cross-validated to avoid overly optimistic conclusions. The estimated accuracy of these prognostic determinations was compared with determinations based on the extent of axillary lymph node involvement. RESULTS. The predicted outcomes based on nuclear features were divided into three groups representing best, intermediate, and worst prognosis, and compared with the traditional TNM lymph node stratification. Nuclear feature stratification better separated the prognostically best from the intermediate group whereas lymph node stratification better separated the prognostically intermediate from the worst group. Prognostic accuracy was not increased by adding lymph node status or tumor size to the nuclear features. CONCLUSIONS. Computer analysis of a preoperative FNA more accurately identified prognostically favorable patients than did pathologic examination of axillary lymph nodes and may obviate the need for routine axillary lymph node dissection.

J	Sheikh, AY; Jones, AG				Sheikh, AY; Jones, AG			Crystallization process optimization via a revised machine learning methodology	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article							DECISION TREES; SYSTEMS; FLUID; FLOW	A revised machine learning methodology is applied to a simulated crystallization process flowsheet for continual improvement of its performance by generating and analyzing process data. The aim is to identify bands of crucial decision variables leading to zones of best average process performance. The methodology comprises two components: symbolic induction and case-based reasoning. It uses an incremental algorithm to update performance classification rules, which not only improves the efficiency of the symbolic induction of the classification rules by eliminating the need for their periodic reinduction but also simplifies the case-based reasoning step. The new concepts and procedures are illustrated by application to a potassium nitrate crystallization process comprising a mixed-suspension, mixed-product-removal crystallizer, a hydrocyclone, and a fines dissolver. By identifying and establishing ranges for the most crucial decision variables, namely feed concentration, flow rate, and cooling stream temperature, three zones leaning to an improvement of nearly 12% on nominal average performance are detected within two generations of the classification rules.

J	Palmer, DD; Hearst, MA				Palmer, DD; Hearst, MA			Adaptive multilingual sentence boundary disambiguation	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article								The sentence is a standard textual unit in natural language processing applications. In many languages the punctuation mark that indicates the end-of-sentence boundary is ambiguous; thus the tokenizers of most NLP systems must be equipped with special sentence boundary recognition rules for every new text collection. As an alternative, this article presents an efficient, trainable system for sentence boundary disambiguation. The system, called Satz, makes simple estimates of the parts of speech of the tokens immediately preceding and following each punctuation mark, and uses these estimates as input to a machine learning algorithm that then classifies the punctuation mark. Satz is very fast both in training and sentence analysis, and its combined robustness and accuracy surpass existing techniques. The system needs only a small lexicon and training corpus, and has been shown to transfer quickly and easily from English to ether languages, as demonstrated on French and German.

The prime objective of a power transmission network is to supply power to the customers and to meet the lend demands. When a fault occurs in a transmission network, it must be identified and eliminated as soon as possible. Since control centres are flooded with hundreds of alarm messages during a fault, fault diagnosis, which involves the analysis of alarm messages, is a time consuming task. Faults in a power network are caused by various environmental conditions which change with time and their diagnosis involves real time decision making which cannot be modelled by using traditional mathematical modelling techniques. Earlier research suggested that decision-support systems can aid system controllers during emergency situations. Artificial intelligence techniques such as expert systems, neural networks and model based reasoning have been used in the past but these techniques lack efficiency when applied to large systems such as power networks. As part of our an going research towards the development of an intelligent architecture for fault diagnosis, we attempt to develop an efficient model by combining two reasoning techniques (model-based and heuristic) and incorporating a machine learning algorithm called Explanation Eased Generalisation (EBG) for automated knowledge acquisition. The machine learning algorithm learns shallow knowledge from the reasoning process of the combined (or hybrid) model and stores it for future problem solving. In this paper, the developed hybrid fault diagnosis system is discussed and its performance is compared with the traditional model based reasoning approach.

J	Wong, ML; Leung, KS				Wong, Man Leung; Leung, Kwong Sak			Evolutionary Program Induction Directed by Logic Grammars	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Machine learning; genetic programming; logic grammars		Program induction generates a computer program that can produce the desired behavior for a given set of situations. Two of the approaches in program induction are inductive logic programming (ILP) and genetic programming (GP). Since their formalisms are so different, these two approaches cannot be integrated easily, although they share many common goals and functionalities. A unification will greatly enhance their problem-solving power. Moreover, they are restricted in the computer languages in which programs can be induced. In this paper, we present a flexible system called LOGENPRO (The Logic grammar-based GENetic PROgramming system) that uses some of the techniques of GP and ILP. It is based on a formalism of logic grammars. The system applies logic grammars to control the evolution of programs in various programming languages and represent context-sensitive information and domain-dependent knowledge. Experiments have been performed to demonstrate that LOGENPRO can emulate GP and GP with automatically defined functions (ADFs). Moreover, LOGENPRO can employ knowledge such as argument types in a unified framework. The experiments show that LOGENPRO has superior performance to that of GP and GP with ADFs when more domain-dependent knowledge is available. We have applied LOGENPRO to evolve general recursive functions for the even-n-parity problem from noisy training examples. A number of experiments have been performed to determine the impact of domain-specific knowledge and noise in training examples on the speed of learning.

Learning to Control the Program Evolution Process with Cultural Algorithms	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Genetic programming; cultural algorithms; software design methodologies; software metrics; machine learning of software design concepts; design concept reuse		Traditional software engineering dictates the use of modular and structured programming and top-down stepwise refinement techniques that reduce the amount of variability arising in the development process by establishing standard procedures to be followed while writing software. This focusing leads to reduced variability in the resulting products, due to the use of standardized constructs. Genetic programming (GP) performs heuristic search in the space of programs. Programs produced through the GP paradigm emerge as the result of simulated evolution and are built through a bottom-up process, incrementally augmenting their functionality until a satisfactory level of performance is reached. Can we automatically extract knowledge from the GP programming process that can be useful to focus the search and reduce product variability, thus leading to a more effective use of the available resources? An answer to this question is investigated with the aid of cultural algorithms. A new system, cultural algorithms with genetic programming (CAGP), is presented. The system has two levels. The first is the pool of genetic programs (population level), and the second is a knowledge repository (belief set) that is built during the GP run and is used to guide the search process. The microevolution within the population brings about potentially meaningful characteristics of the programs for the achievement of the given task, such as properties exhibited by the best performers in the population. CAGP extracts these features and represents them as the set of the current beliefs. Beliefs correspond to constraints that all the genetic operators and programs must follow. Interaction between the two levels occurs in one direction through the extraction process and, in the other, through the modulation of an individual's program parameters according to which, and how many, of the constraints it follows. CAGP is applied to solve an instance of the symbolic regression problem, in which a function of one variable needs to be discovered. The results of the experiments show an overall improvement on the average performance of CAGP over GP alone and a significant reduction of the complexity of the produced solution. Moreover, the execution time required by CAGP is comparable with the time required by GP alone.

Watersheds ranged in size by four orders of magnitude. Results of the neural network predictions ranged from correlations of 0.73 for 104 test data in the Souris-Red Rainy river basin to 0.95 for 141 test data in California. These results are improvements over previous multilinear regressions involving more variables that showed correlations ranging from 0.26 to 0.94. Results are presented for neural networks trained and tested on drainage area, average annual precipitation, and mean basin elevation. A neural network trained on regional scale data in the Texas Gulf was comparable to previous estimates of Q(2) by regression. Our research shows Q(2) was difficult to predict for the Souris-Red Rainy, Missouri, and Rio Grande river basins compared to the rest of the US, and acceptable predictions could be made using only mean basin elevation and drainage areas of watersheds.

J	AbdelAal, RE; AlHaddad, MN				AbdelAal, RE; AlHaddad, MN			Determination of radioisotopes in gamma-ray spectroscopy using abductive machine learning	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						machine learning; gamma-ray spectroscopy; spectrum analysis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; AUTOMATIC-ANALYSIS; TEMPERATURE; SPECTRA	An algorithmic approach has been adopted for many years for identifying and quantifying radioisotopes in high-resolution gamma-ray spectra. Complexity of the technique, particularly when used with lower resolution detectors, warrants looking for machine-learning alternatives where intensive computations are required only during training, while actual sample analysis is greatly simplified. This should be advantageous in developing simple portable systems for fast online analysis of large numbers of samples, particularly in situations where accuracy can be traded off for speed and simplicity. Solutions based on neural networks have been reported in the literature. This paper describes the use of abductive networks which offer shorter training times and a simpler and more automated approach to model synthesis. The Abductory Induction Mechanism (AIM)(1) tool was used to build models for determining isotopes in both single- and multiple-isotope samples represented by spectra from an NaI (T1) detector. In spite of a 50-fold poorer resolution for the AIM spectral data, AIM results are adequate, with average errors ranging between 11.8% and 20.5% for a number of simulated multi-isotope cocktails.

This machine learning strategy generated heuristics that can assist in the choice for a detection method for a specified set of IC method and solute properties. It was shown that the final set of rules proposed detectors that agreed with the database for 76% of the cases. Application to a separate test set showed a prediction ability of 82%. The database, because of the characteristics of the included cases, did not allow for a significant improvement of these results. However, the results are of significance for the further development of knowledge systems, which assist in the design of IC methods. Furthermore, this dataset comprised a considerable challenge to the applied machine learning method.

A simple criterion to remove an attribute based on the accuracy rate of the network is developed. The network is retrained after removal of an attribute, and the selection process is repeated until no attribute meets the criterion for removal, Our experimental results suggest that the proposed method works very well on a wide variety of classification problems.

This problem has received considerable attention in the areas of pattern recognition and machine learning, and many distinct methods have been proposed in literature. We make a comparative study of six well-known pruning methods with the aim of understanding their theoretical foundations, their computational complexity, and the strengths and weaknesses of their formulation. Comments on the characteristics of each method are empirically supported. In particular, a wide experimentation performed on several data sets leads us to opposite conclusions on the predictive accuracy of simplified trees from some drawn in the literature. We attribute this divergence to differences in experimental designs. Finally, we prove and make use of a property of the reduced error pruning method to obtain an objective evaluation of the tendency to overprune/underprune observed in each method.

The attribute weights in the distance function should be set appropriately. We study situations where a simple approach of setting attribute weights using decision trees does not work well, and design three improvements.

A minority of cases cannot be classified as benign or malignant. These FNAs are assigned an inconclusive diagnosis, often prompting surgical biopsy. Surgery is justified in some of these cases, but many of these lesions are benign. If these inconclusive FNAs could be accurately diagnosed as benign or malignant, many of these patients might avoid having to undergo surgical biopsy. METHODS, An image analysis and an automated learning system that was developed at the University of Wisconsin (Xcyt) was used to categorize 56 (37 benign and 19 malignant) breast FNAs diagnosed as ''indeterminate'' and the computer diagnosis compared with the surgical biopsy. For each case, an operator chose a group of cells within a single field on the FNA slide and digitized this image using a video camera. The outline of each nucleus was manually outlined, and the exact border was delineated by the computer. Based on the analysis of three nuclear features (area, texture, and smoothness), the Xcyt system computed a benign or malignant diagnosis and a corresponding probability of malignancy for each case. RESULTS, Probabilities of malignancy for the respective cases ranged from 0.0-1.0. Benign cases were defined as those having probabilities of malignancy < 0.3; those with probabilities above this limit were considered malignant. Using these criteria, the computer identified 33 cases as benign and 23 cases as malignant. When compared with the surgical biopsy, 42 of the cases (75%) were correctly classified with a sensitivity and specificity of 73.7% and 75.7%, respectively. There were only 5 false-negative cases with a false-negative rate of 13.5% and a predictive value of a negative test of 84.8%. CONCLUSIONS. When faced with inconclusive diagnoses on FNAs of breast masses, the authors believe that image analysis may be used as an aid in the further classification of such lesions, thereby providing a more appropriate triage for surgical biopsy.

J	Dean, P; Famili, A				Dean, P; Famili, A			Comparative performance of rule quality measures in an induction system	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						intelligent manufacturing; rule quality; machine learning; induction; past-processing		This paper addresses an important problem related to the use of induction systems in analyzing real world data. The problem is the quality and reliability of the rules generated by the systems. We discuss the significance of having a reliable and efficient rule quality measure. Such a measure can provide useful support in interpreting, ranking and applying the rules generated by an induction system. A number of rule quality and statistical measures are selected from the literature and their performance is evaluated on four sets of semiconductor data. The primary goal of this testing and evaluation has been to investigate the performance of these quality measures based on: (i) accuracy, (ii) coverage, (iii) positive error ratio, and (iv) negative error ratio of the rule selected by each measure. Moreover, the sensitivity of these quality measures to different data distributions is examined. In conclusion, we recommend Cohen's statistic as being the best quality measure examined for the domain. Finally, we explain some future work to be done in this area.

Computer-based empirical learning systems based on classical and nonparametric statistics, connectionist models, machine learning methods, and fuzzy logic are described. An original method for inducing fuzzy rules from input-output data is presented. Performance comparisons of the various approaches are summarized, along with the relative intelligibility of the outputs. In both respects, the decision-tree approach was found to perform very well on the problem investigated.

The classification of various discharge pulses in EDM is based on the features of the measured gap voltage and gap current. To obtain optimal classification performance, a machine learning method based on a simulated annealing algorithm is adopted to automatically synthesize the membership functions of the fuzzy pulse discriminator. Experimental results have shown that EDM discharge pulses can be not only correctly but also quickly classified under varying cutting conditions using this approach.

J	Lee, CY; Piramuthu, S; Tsai, YK				Lee, CY; Piramuthu, S; Tsai, YK			Job shop scheduling with a genetic algorithm and machine learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM	Dynamic job shop scheduling has been proven to be an intractable problem for analytical procedures. Recent advances in computing technology, especially in artificial intelligence, have alleviated this problem by intelligently restricting the search space considered, thus opening the possibility of obtaining better results. Researchers have used various techniques that were developed under the general rubric of artificial intelligence to solve job shop scheduling problems. The most common of these have been expert systems, genetic algorithms and machine learning. Of these, we identify machine learning and genetic algorithms to be promising for scheduling applications in a job shop. In this paper, we propose to combine complementarily the strengths of genetic algorithms and induced decision trees, a machine learning technique, to develop a job shop scheduling system. Empirical results, using machine learning for releasing jobs into the shop floor and a genetic algorithm to dispatch jobs at each machine, are promising.

J	Verdenius, F; vanSomeren, MW				Verdenius, F; vanSomeren, MW			Applications of inductive learning techniques: a survey in the Netherlands	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ALGORITHMS; SYSTEM	Interest for machine learning techniques has increased over the last decade. In spite of this the application practice of these techniques has never been systematically analysed. This paper analyses the practical application of Inductive Learning Techniques in the Netherlands by means of a survey. Results of this survey are assessed in terms of introduction of (information) technological innovation. The application practice for these techniques finds itself in an initial stage. Current practice is dominated by technical issues and there is little attention for methodological issues associated with analysis of the problem and data collection. In the paper we propose a four level model for describing the methodological aspects of ILT application. The current practice of application concentrates on the two lowermost layers. Tools for developing applications concentrate mainly on the lowest, technical level.

J	Furnkranz, J; Petrak, J; Trappl, R				Furnkranz, J; Petrak, J; Trappl, R			Knowledge discovery in international conflict databases	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							MEDIATION	Artificial intelligence (AI) is heavily supported by military institutions, while practically no effort goes into the investigation of possible contributions of AI to the avoidance and termination of crises and wars. This article rakes a first step in this direction by investigating the use of machine learning techniques for discovering knowledge in international conflict and conflict management databases. We have applied similarity-based case retrieval to the KOSIMO database of international conflicts. Furthermore, we present results of analyzing the CONFMAN database of successful and unsuccessful conflict management attempts with an inductive decision tree learning algorithm. The latter approach seems to be particularly promising, as conflict management events apparently are more repetitive and thus better suited for machine-aided analysis.

J	Chater, N				Chater, N			What is the type-1/type-2 distinction?	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material								Clark & Thornton's type-1/2 distinction is not well-defined. The classes of type-1 and type-2 problems are too broad: many noncomputable functions are type-1 and type-2 learnable. They are also too narrow: trivial functions, such as identity, are neither type-1 nor type-2 learnable. Moreover, the scope of type-1 and type-2 problems appears to be equivalent. Overall, this distinction does not appear useful for machine learning or cognitive science.		Chater, N (reprint author), UNIV WARWICK,DEPT PSYCHOL,COVENTRY CV4 7AL,W MIDLANDS,ENGLAND.						Hinton G.

J	Passonneau, RJ; Litman, DJ				Passonneau, RJ; Litman, DJ			Discourse segmentation by human and automated means	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article								The need to model the relation between discourse structure and linguistic features of utterances is almost universally acknowledged in the literature on discourse. However, there is only weak consensus on what the units of discourse structure are, or the criteria for recognizing and generating them. We present quantitative results of a two-part study using a corpus of spontaneous, narrative monologues. The first part of our paper presents a method for empirically validating multiutterance units referred to as discourse segments. We report highly significant results of segmentations performed by naive subjects, where a commonsense notion of speaker intention is the segmentation criterion. In the second part of our study, data abstracted from the subjects' segmentations serve as a target for evaluating two sets of algorithms that use utterance features to perform segmentation. On the first algorithm set, we evaluate and compare the correlation of discourse segmentation with three types of linguistic cues (referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses). We then develop a second set using two methods: error analysis and machine learning. Testing the new algorithms on a new data set shows that when multiple sources of linguistic knowledge are used concurrently, algorithm performance improves.

Current practices include regular insulation condition tests for switching devices, reactors, power transformers, and so on. Many of the indicators of equipment condition are imprecise, unreliable and costly to obtain on a regular basis. To achieve useful results, engineers must gain extensive experience with particular rests. This work suggests several methods for extracting information front test data and through these methods compares intelligent system approaches.

To perform effectively, such agents need knowledge of user preferences. An agent architecture has been developed which observes a user performing tasks, and identifies features which can be used as training data by a learning algorithm. Using the learned profile, an agent can give advice to the user on dealing with new situations. The architecture has been applied to two different information filtering domains: classifying incoming mail messages (Magi) and identifying interesting USENet news articles (UNA). This paper describes the architecture and examines the results of experimentation with different learning algorithms and different feature extraction strategies within these domains.

J	Hong, TP; Tseng, SS				Hong, TP; Tseng, SS			A generalized version space learning algorithm for noisy and uncertain data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						machine learning; version space; multiple version spaces; noise; uncertainty; training instance		This paper generalizes the learning strategy of version space to manage noisy and uncertain training data. A new learning algorithm is proposed that consists of two main phases: searching and pruning. The searching phase generates and collects possible candidates into a large set; the pruning phase then prunes this set according to various criteria to find a maximally consistent version space. When the training instances cannot completely be classified, the proposed learning algorithm can make a trade-off between including positive training instances and excluding negative ones according to the requirements of different application domains. Furthermore, suitable pruning parameters are chosen according to a given time limit, so the algorithm can also make a trade-off between time complexity and accuracy. The proposed learning algorithm is then a flexible and efficient induction method that makes the version space learning strategy more practical.

Simulations on an animal identification problem indicate that a priori symbolic knowledge always improves system performance, especially with a small training set, Benchmark study on a DNA promoter recognition problem shows that with the added advantage of fast learning, cascade ARTMAP rule insertion and refinement algorithms produce performance superior to those of other machine learning systems and an alternative hybrid system known as knowledge-based artificial neural network (KBANN), Also, the rules extracted from cascade ARTMAP are more accurate and much cleaner than the NofM rules extracted from KBANN.

J	Mookerjee, VS; Mannino, MV				Mookerjee, VS; Mannino, MV			Redesigning case retrieval to reduce information acquisition costs	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						case based systems; case retrieval algorithms; information costs; cost reduction; joint versus separate optimization	KNOWLEDGE	Retrieval of a set of cases similar to a new case is a problem common to a number of machine learning approaches such as nearest neighbor algorithms, conceptual clustering, and case based reasoning. A limitation of most case retrieval algorithms is their lack of attention to information acquisition costs. When information acquisition costs are considered, cost reduction is hampered by the practice of separating concept formation and retrieval strategy formation. To demonstrate the above claim, we examine two approaches. The first approach separates concept formation and retrieval strategy formation. To form a retrieval strategy in this approach, we develop the CRlc (case retrieval loss criterion) algorithm that selects attributes in ascending order of expected loss. The second approach jointly optimizes concept formation and retrieval strategy formation using a cost based variant of the ID3 algorithm (ID3(c)). ID3(c) builds a decision tree wherein attributes are selected using entropy reduction per unit information acquisition cost. Experiments with four data sets are described in which algorithm, attribute cost coefficient of variation, and matching threshold are factors. The experimental results demonstrate that (i) jointly optimizing concept formation and retrieval strategy formation has substantial benefits, and (ii) using cost considerations can significantly reduce information acquisition costs, even if concept formation and retrieval strategy formation are separated.

J	Vickery, B				Vickery, B			Knowledge discovery from databases: An introductory review	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article							MACHINE	The paper aims to provide a non-technical introduction to the new procedures being used to extract knowledge from databases. The reasons for developing knowledge discovery methods are discussed - primarily, the current production of very large databases that may include many data relations not explicit in the database structure. The background in machine learning is indicated. The methods used are described for such techniques as classification (sorting data into predefined classes), clustering (developing ab initio a data classification) and the detection of deviations from pre-established norms. Examples of the applications of these methods are given. The paper concludes with some brief thoughts about the potential use of knowledge discovery in the information field.

J	Mahajan, A; Figueroa, F				Mahajan, A; Figueroa, F			Four-legged intelligent mobile autonomous robot	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article						walking robots; intelligent sensing; autonomous behavior; machine learning	MODEL	This paper presents the design and development of a four-legged mobile robot with intelligent sensing and decisionmaking capabilities. Multiple sensors with embedded knowledge bases and learning capabilities are used in a novel approach towards environmental perception and reaction. These sensors continuously monitor the environment as well as their own operating parameters. Priority is given to any one or a group of sensors based on prevailing environmental conditions. Intelligent sensing is shown to be the key towards a high degree of autonomy for a mobile robot. Nicknamed Flimar, this robot has the ability to function at varying degrees of intelligence made possible by an object-oriented architecture with embedded intelligence at various levels. This architecture is shown to be conducive towards incremental learning. Each of the four legs has three degrees of freedom, i.e. Flimar has a total of 12 motors on its four legs. Flimar can walk and turn without dragging or skidding, and also turns about its center of gravity with a zero radius. Flimar responds to light, sound and touch in different ways, based on prevailing environmental conditions. The overall goal of the paper is to present a novel walking principle and control architecture for a walking robot. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
