<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Three accumulations: settings, data and devices</h1>
<p>Three different accumulations cross-stratify in machine learning: settings, data and devices. The volume and geography of searches on Google Search provides some evidence of the diverse settings or sites doing machine learning. If we search for terms such as <code>artificial intelligence, machine learning</code> and <code>data mining</code> on the <a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a> service , the results for the last decade or so suggest shifting interest in these topics.</p>

<p>In Figure , two general search terms that had a very high search volume in 2004 – ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘data mining’   – slowly decline over the years before starting to increase again in the last few years. By contrast, <code>machine learning</code> loses volume until around 2008, and then gradually rises again so that by mid-2016 it exceeds the long-standing interests in data-mining and artificial intelligence. Whatever the difficulties in understanding GoogleTrends results, these curves suggest an accumulation of sites and settings turning towards machine learning.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>  What does it mean that machine learning surfaces in so many different places, from fMRIs to Facebook’s <code>AI-Flow</code> <span class="citation">[@Facebook_2016]</span>, , from fisheries management to Al Queda courier network monitoring by <code>SkyNet</code>?<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> </p>

<p>A second accumulation concerns the plenitude of things in the world as data.  If we wanted to describe the general horizon of machine learning as a data practice in its specificity, we might turn to cats.  Cat images accumulate on websites and social media platforms as de-centred, highly repetitive data forms. Like the billions of search engine queries, email messages, tweets, or much contemporary scientific data (e.g. the DNA sequence data discussed in chapter ), images accumulate in archives of communication. Take the case of <code>kittydar,</code> a machine learner in the area of image recognition (see <a href="http://harthur.github.io/kittydar">kittydar</a>): ‘Kittydar is short for kitty radar. Kittydar takes an image (canvas) and tells you the locations of all the cats in the image’ <span class="citation">[@Arthur_2012]</span>.  This playful piece of code demonstrates how machine learning can be amidst mundane accumulation. Heather Arthur, who developed <code>kittydar</code> writes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kittydar first chops the image up into many “windows” to test for the presence of a cat head. For each window, kittydar first extracts more tractable data from the image’s data. Namely, it computes the Histogram of Orient Gradients descriptor of the image … This data describes the directions of the edges in the image (where the image changes from light to dark and vice versa) and what strength they are. This data is a vector of numbers that is then fed into a neural network … which gives a number from 0 to 1 on how likely the histogram data represents a cat. The neural network … has been pre-trained with thousands of photos of cat heads and their histograms, as well as thousands of non-cats. See the repo for the node training scripts <span class="citation">[@Arthur_2012]</span>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This toy device finds cat heads in digital photographs, but also exemplifies many key traits of machine learning. Large accumulations of things become  in a dataset.  A dataset is used to train a typical machine learning device, a neural net,  and the neural net <em>classifies</em> subsequent images probabilistically. The code for all this is ‘in the repo.’  Based on how it locates cats, we can begin to imagine similar pattern recognition techniques in use in self-driving cars <span class="citation">[@Thrun_2006]</span>, border control facial recognition systems, military robots or wherever something seen implies something to do.</p>
<p>Faced with the immense accumulation of cat images on the internet, <code>kittydar</code> can do very little. It only detects the presence of cats that face forward. And it sometimes classifies people as cats. As Arthur’s description suggests, the software finds cats by cutting the images into smaller windows. For each window, it measures a set of gradients – a spatial order of great significance in machine learning -  running from light and dark, and then compares these measurements to the gradients of known cat images (the so-called ‘training data’). The work of classification according to the simple categories of ‘cat’ or ‘not cat’  is given either to a neural network (as discussed in chapter , a typical machine learning technique and one that has recently been heavily developed by researchers at Google <span class="citation">[@Le_2011]</span>, themselves working on images of cats among other things taken from Youtube videos <span class="citation">[@BBC_2012]</span>, or to a support vector machine (a technique first developed in the 1990s by researchers working at IBM; see chapter ). </p>
<p>A final accumulation comprises machine learning techniques and devices. Machine learning range from the mundane to the esoteric, from code miniatures such as <code>kittydar</code> to the infrastructural sublime of computational clouds and clusters twirling in internet data-streams. Like the images that <code>kittydar</code> classifies, the names of machine learning techniques and devices proliferate and accumulate in textbooks, instructional courses, website tutorials, software libraries and code listings: linear regression, logistic regression,  neural networks, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines,  k-means clustering,  decision trees, <em>k</em> nearest neighbours,  random forests,  principal component analysis, or naive Bayes   to name just some of the most commonly used. Sometimes they have proper names: <code>RF-ACE</code>, <code>Le-Net5</code>, or <code>C4.5</code>. These names refer to predictive models and to computational algorithms of various ilk and provenance. Intricate data practices – normalization, regularization, cross-validation, feature engineering, feature selection, optimisation  – embroider datasets into shapes they can recognise. The techniques, algorithms and models are not necessarily startling new or novel. They take shape against a background of more than a century of work in mathematics, statistics, computer science as well as disparate scientific fields ranging from anthropology to zoology. Mathematical constructs drawn from linear algebra, differential calculus, numerical optimization and probability theory pervade practice in the field.  Machine learning itself is an accumulation rather than a radical transformation.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>In the plot (Figure , the weekly variations in search volume on Google give rise to many spikes in the data. These spikes can be linked to specific events such as significant press releases, public debates, media attention and film releases. It is hard to know who is doing these searches. The data provided by Google Trends includes geography, and it would be interesting to compare the geographies of interest in the different terms over time.<a href="9-three-accumulations-settings-data-and-devices.html#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>The diagram shown in Figure  actually draws two lines for each trend. The ‘raw’ weekly GoogleTrends data – definitely not raw data, as it has been normalized to a percentage <span class="citation">[@Gitelman_2013]</span> – appears in the very spiky lines, but a much smoother line shows the general trend. This smoothing line is the work of a statistical model – a local regression or loess model <span class="citation">[@Cleveland_1992]</span>  developed in the late 1970s.  The line depends on intensive computation and models (linear regression, <em>k</em> nearest neighbours,  ). The smoother lines make the spiky weekly search counts supplied by Google much easier to see. They construct alignments in the data by replacing the irregular variations with a curve that unequivocally runs through time with greater regularity. The smoothed lines shade the diagram with a predictive pattern. The lineaments of machine learning already appear in such lines. How have things been arranged so that smooth lines run through an accumulated archive of search data?<a href="9-three-accumulations-settings-data-and-devices.html#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
