<h1><span class="header-section-number">23</span> The visible learning of machine learning</h1>
<p>For a book with ‘learning’ in its title, <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> has visibly little to say about how to learn machine learning.  ‘Learning’ is briefly discussed on the first page of <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em>, but the book hardly ever returns to the topic or even that term explicitly. We learn on page 2 that a ‘learner’ in machine learning is a model that predicts outcomes. (As I discuss in chapter , learning is comprehensively understood in machine learning as finding a mathematical <em>function</em> that could have generated the data, and optimising the search for that function as much as possible.)  The notion of learning in machine learning derives from the field of artificial intelligence. The broad project of artificial intelligence, at least as envisaged in its 1960s-1970s heyday as a form of symbolic reasoning, is today largely regarded as a dead-end. </p>
<p>How then did learning get into the title of <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em>? Does ‘learning’ anthropomorphize statistical modelling or computer programming?  The so-called ‘learning problem’ and the theory of learning machines developed by researchers in the 1960-1970s was largely based on work already done in the 1950s on cybernetic devices such as the perceptron, the prototypical neural network model developed by the psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in the 1950s <span class="citation">[@Rosenblatt_1958]</span>.   Drawing on the McCulloch-Pitts model of the neurone and mathematical techniques of optimization <span class="citation">[@Bellman_1961]</span>, Rosenblatt implemented the perceptron, which today would be called a single-layer neural network <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 393]</span> as an electro-mechanical device at the Cornell University Aeronautical Laboratory in 1957. For present purposes, it is interesting to see what diagrams Rosenblatt used and how they differ from contemporary diagrams.</p>

<p>If we compare the diagram of Rosenblatt’s perceptron shown in Figure  to the typical contemporary diagram of a neural network shown in Figure , the differences are not that great in many ways. The diagram of a neural network found in Rosenblatt’s paper <span class="citation">[@Rosenblatt_1958]</span> has no mathematical symbols on it, but the one from <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009]</span> does. Rosenblatt’s retains neuro-cognitive-anatomical reference points (retina, association area, projection area) whereas Hastie et. al.‘s replaces them with the symbols that we have already seen in play in the expression for the linear model . What has happened between the two diagrams? As Vladimir Vapnik, a leading machine learning theorist, observes: ’the perceptron was constructed to solve pattern recognition problems; in the simplest case this is the problem of constructing a rule for separating data of two different categories using given examples’ <span class="citation">[@Vapnik_1999, 2]</span>.  While computer scientists in artificial intelligence of the time, such as Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, were sceptical about the capacity of the perceptron model to distinguish or ‘learn’ different patterns <span class="citation">[@Minsky_1969]</span>, later work showed that perceptrons could ‘learn universally’<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. For present purposes, the key point is not that neural networks have turned out several decades later to be extremely powerful algorithms in learning to distinguish patterns, and that intense research in neural networks has led to their ongoing development and increasing sophistication in many ‘real world’ applications (see for instance, for their use in sciences <span class="citation">[@Hinton_2006]</span>, or in commercial applications such as drug prediction <span class="citation">[@Dahl_2013]</span> and above all in the current surge of interest in ‘deep learning’ by social media platform and search engines such as Facebook and Google).  For our purposes, the important point is that the notion of the learning machine began to establish an ongoing diagonalization that transforms basic diagrammatic pattern through substitutions of increasingly convoluted or nested operations. The whole claim that machines ‘learn’ rests on this diagrammatization that recurrently and sometimes recursively transforms the icon of relations, sometimes in the graphic forms shown above and more often in the algebraic patterns.</p>
<p>The changes in graphics suggest transformations in the operational formation. I am suggesting, then, that we should follow the transformations associated with machine learning diagrammatically, provided we maintain a rich understanding of diagram, and remain open to multiple vectors of abstraction.  Following Peirce, we might begin to see machine learning as a diagrammatic practice in which different semiotic forms – lines, numbers, symbols, operators, patches of colour, words, images, marks such as dots, crosses, ticks and arrowheads – are constantly connected, substituted, embedded or created from existing diagrams. The diagrams we have already seen from <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> - algebraic formulae and network topology - don’t exhaust the variations at all. Just a brief glance through this book or almost any other in the field shows not only many formulae, but tables, matrices, arrays, line graphs, contour plots, scatter plots, dendrograms and trees, as well as algorithms expressed as pseudo-code. The connections between these diagrams are not always very tight or close. Learning to machine learning (whether you are a human learner or a learner in the sense of a machine) means dancing between diagrams. This dance is relatively silent and sometimes almost motionless as signs slide between different diagrammatic articulations. Diagrammatization offers then a way to track the ongoing project which tries treat data like farmers treat crops (see epigraph from Domingos in this chapter). To understand what machines can learn, we need to look at how they have been drawn, designed, or formalised. But what in this work of designing and formalising predictive models is like farming? Some very divergent trajectories open up here. On the one hand, the diagrams become machines when they are implemented. On the other hand, the machines generate new diagrams when they function. We need to countenance both forms of movement in order to understand any of the preceding diagrams – the algebraic expressions or the diagrams of models such as the perceptron or its descendants, the neural network. This means going downstream from the textbooks into actual implementations and places where people, algorithms, and machines mingle more than they do in the relatively neat formality of the textbooks. Rather than history or controversies in the field, I focus on the migratory patterns of methods, and the many configurational shifts associated with their implementations as the same things appears in different places. </p>

<li id="fn16"><p>In describing the entwined elements of machine learning techniques, and citing various machine learning textbooks, I’m not attempting to provide any detailed history of their development. My   of these developments does not explore the archives of institutions, laboratories or companies where these techniques took shape. It derives much more either from following citations back out of the highly distilled textbooks into the teeming collective labour of research on machine learning as published in hundreds of thousands of articles in science and engineering journals, or from looking at, experimenting with and implementing techniques in code. For instance, <span class="citation">[@Olazaran_1996]</span> offers a history of the perceptron controversy from a science studies perspective.  During the 1980s, artificial intelligence and associated approaches (expert systems, automated decision support, neural networks, etc.) were a matter of some debate in the sociology and anthropology of science. The work of Harry Collins would be one example of this <span class="citation">[@Collins_1990]</span>, Paul Edwards on artificial intelligence and Cold War <span class="citation">[@Edwards_1996]</span>, Nathan Ensmenger on chess <span class="citation">[@Ensmenger_2012]</span>, and Lucy Suchman on plans and expert systems <span class="citation">[@Suchman_1987]</span> would be others. Philosophers such as Hubert Dreyfus (<em>What Computers Can’t Do</em> <span class="citation">[@Dreyfus_1972; @Dreyfus_1992]</span> had already extensively criticised AI.  In the 1990s, the appearance of new forms of simulation, computational fields such as a-life and new forms of robotics such as Rodney Brook’s much more insect-like robots at MIT attracted the interest of social scientists <span class="citation">[@Helmreich_2000]</span> amongst many others. Sometimes this interest was critical of claims to expertise (Collins), and at other times, interested in how to make sense of the claims without foreclosing their potential novelty (Helmreich). By and large, I don’t attend to controversies in machine learning as a scientific field, and I don’t directly contest the epistemic authority of the proponents of the techniques. I share with Lucy Suchman an interest in how the ‘effect of machine-as-agent is generated’ and in how ‘translations … render former objects as emergent subjects’<span class="citation">[@Suchman_2006,2]</span>.  I diverge around the site of empirical attention. I’m persevering with the diagrams in each of the following chapters in order to track the movement of tendencies that are not so visible in terms of either the controversies or the assumptions of agency embodied in many AI systems of the 1980s. The agency of machine learning, in short, might not reside so much in any putative predictive or classificatory power if manifests, but rather its capacity to mutate and migrate across contexts. <a href="23-the-visible-learning-of-machine-learning.html#fnref16">↩</a></p></li>
