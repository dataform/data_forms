<h1><span class="header-section-number">75</span> Competitions as examination</h1>
<p>More or less directly, the observation of error rates converging towards minimum values assigns a subject position the role of controlling hyper-parameters such as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the learning rate. This seems a drastic curtailment of agency. The related feed-forward and back-propagation of errors focuses the machine learner subject, the ‘wonderful people’ of Hilary Mason’s exhortation to developers, on error. At almost every step of its development as a field and in almost every aspect of its operation, competitions to observe and rank error rates bring human and machine learners together. In competitions, errors are not purely epistemic.  They circulate within a wider economy of competitive optimisation that connect them to power, value and agency dynamics. The learning of machine learning takes place in examinations that rank both human and non-human machine learners according to error rates.  What can we learn from such competitions about subject positions in machine learning?</p>
<p>Backwards and forwards movement between human and machine machine learners characterises competitions run by <a href="http://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>. Kaggle organizationally implements a parallel architecture machine learning process by back-propagating errors to hidden nodes embodied in individual competitors who, in principle at least, are not connected to each other, but only to the layers and nodes of Kaggle itself as a platform. In comparison to the research-oriented machine learning competitions such as the annual (KDD Cup)[<a href="http://www.sigkdd.org/kddcup/index.php" class="uri">http://www.sigkdd.org/kddcup/index.php</a>]<span class="citation">[@KDD_2013]</span> run by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) Challenges, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge <span class="citation">[@ILSVRC_2014]</span> or the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)[<a href="http://machinelearning.org/icml.html" class="uri">http://machinelearning.org/icml.html</a>], the Kaggle competitions attract a wide range of academic, industry, commercial and individual entries. </p>
<p>Competitors no doubt enter these competitions for various reasons, not the least of which is their employment prospects or the promotion of their machine learning products (for instance, the winner of a major competition, the Heritage Health Fund Prize in 2012 uses that prize to promote the data mining software made by his company (Tiberius)[Tiberius.biz]; an entrant in the Hewlett ‘Automated Essay Competition’ again in 2012 included Pacific Metrics, a US company whose automated essay scoring products were already in use in U.S. schools; while Pacific Metrics did not win the competition, it acquired the winning machine learner and incorporated it into its products <span class="citation">[@Kaggle_2012]</span>). Kaggle.com is effectively a recruitment agency for machine learners <span class="citation">[@Kaggle_2015d]</span>. Some competitions have recruitment opportunities as the prize. For instance, several competitions sponsored by Facebook have positions as data scientist at Facebook as the prize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever wonder what it’s like to work at Facebook? Facebook and Kaggle are launching an Engineering competition for 2015. Trail blaze your way to the top of the leader board to earn an opportunity at interviewing for a role as a software engineer, working on world class Machine Learning problems <span class="citation">[@Kaggle_2015]</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While most employment agencies rely on CVs (curriculum vitae), Kaggle operates more like feed-forward and back-propagation between multiple competitions as a way of optimising its ranking of machine learners. </p>
<p>The competition organizers list three injunctions: download (the data), build (a model), and submit (an entry or many entries to the competition). Leader-boards and individual rankings within the Kaggle’s “world’s largest community of data scientists” <span class="citation">[@Kaggle_2015b]</span>, <a href="#fn100" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a> allow clients –corporations mostly – to ‘harness the “cognitive surplus”’ <span class="citation">[@Kaggle_2015c]</span>. The figure also shows some of the typical diversity of the several hundred machine learning competitions that Kaggle has staged since 2011: diabetic retinopathy and west Nile virus prediction competition appear next to search results relevance or context ad clicks competitions. As we have seen frequently, accumulation, aggregation and proximity, whether accidental or constructed, between very disparate entities suggests that machine learners possess epistemic mobility not readily available to the domain experts (in diabetes, virology, information retrieval or search engine optimisation).</p>

<p>Like a neural network with many layers and nodes, competitions subject competitors (several hundred thousand in Kaggle) to ranking and indeed prediction based on the generalization error  of the models that they submit to the competition. The leader-board, which displays current rankings of competitors in a given competition, is the visual form of this error-based ranking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The leaderboard is a central fixture of the Kaggle experience. It provides context to the incredible work accomplished by the Kaggle data science community. To a competitor, the leaderboard is a dynamic, living, action-filled battle. Tactics come to life. Individuals leapfrog over each other. Teams merge and blend submissions. Some submit early and often, attempting to build up insurmountable leads. Others bide time, waiting to pounce minutes before the buzzer with their finest of forests. We see the joys of regularization and the agony of overfitting. … It’s thousands of hours of collective human toil <span class="citation">[@Kaggle_2015c]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dynamics of ranking, and the experience of being ranked here arise from a fairly simple mechanism. Entrants in a given competition download two datasets, a training dataset that includes labels for all the response variables, and a test dataset that does not include the labels. In principle, competitors construct machine learners using the training dataset, use their machine learner to predict labels for the test dataset, and then upload the predicted labels to Kaggle as a submission to the competition. The Kaggle platform then calculates a ranking based on the generalization error in the test labels.<a href="#fn101" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> Competitors optimise their entries against each other, but the competition overall functions as a kind of general optimization process in which many hidden nodes adjust their treatment to the training data as scores and rankings propagate through via the leaderboard system. The very stylised injunction to download-model-submit many times effectively creates an algorithmic process in which many hidden nodes operate in parallel to produce predictions. </p>
