<h1><span class="header-section-number">44</span> The power to learn</h1>
<p>The power of machine learning to learn, its power to epistemologize, pivots around functions in disparate yet connected ways: the transformation of data through operational functions that map new sub-spaces in vector space and in the observational functions that algorithmically superimpose new constraints – cost, loss or objective functions – that direct an iterative process of optimisation.   Machine learning diagrammatically distributes learning in the operational human-machine formation. People look at curves for evidence of convergence, functions compress data into functions that support classification or predictions, and algorithms observe gradients or rates of error in relation to model parameters. In several senses, people and machines together move along curves. The logistic function folds the lines that best fit the data into a probability distribution that can be read in terms of classification. The cost functions, as they seek to minimize differences between the predicted values and the known values found in the vector space, control variations in the model. Every observer in this domain is partial, since the humans cannot see lines or curves in the multi-dimensional data, the functions that underpin models such as logistic regression or linear regression can transform data in the vector space, but can’t show how well they see it, and the processes of optimisation only see the results of the model and its errors, not anything in its referential functioning.  Universality (<em>apropos</em> master algorithms), whether fully supervised or completely unsupervised, is impossible here.</p>
<p>Amidst this endemic partiality, we can begin to understand the multiplication of machine learners and the mirage of universality. Machine learners are functions that transform data and observe the effects of those transformation in learning to classify, predict and rank. But the function that defines a ‘machine learner’ contracts a range of partial observers relaying values and changes to each other.  The operational power of machine learning depends on the diagrammatic and sometimes experimental relays between different practices of observing. Attending to specific mathematical functions in isolation – the logistic function, the Lagrangean, the Gaussian, the quadratic discriminant, etc. – will not tell us how the operational power of functions comes together in machine learning, but it may provide ways of mapping the diagrammatic connections, the enunciative function that connects different elements in the production of consequential classifications and predictions, generating operational statements in fields of knowledge. </p>
<p>We are in a slightly better position to understand now how there can be many machine learners but a relative sparsity in the production of statements.  Gradients – continuous variations in rate – are useful because they generate many functions, many approximations within one operational process, within one enunciative function. The profusion of machine learners, the ‘bewildering variety’ that Domingos and others celebrate and flag up, can be seen as the effect of an operational formation predicated on approximation through variation.</p>
<p>In his account of Foucault’s diagrams of power, Gilles Deleuze writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>every diagram is intersocial and constantly evolving. It never functions in order to represent a persisting world but produces a new kind of reality, a new model of truth. … It makes history by unmaking preceding realities and significations, constituting hundreds of points of emergence or creativity, unexpected conjunctions or improbable continuums <span class="citation">[@Deleuze_1988, 35]</span>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Functions in machine learning are ‘intersocial’ in the sense that they bring together very different mathematical, algorithmic, operational and observational processes. The sigmoid function switches the geometry of the linear model over into the calculation of probabilities and classification, but also figures heavily in the computability of partial derivatives. The cost functions re-craft statistical modelling as a quasi-iterative process of model generation and comparison. New kinds of realities arise in which the classifications and predictions generated by the diagonal connections between mathematical functions and operational processes of optimisation can constitute a ‘new model truth’ and can unmake ‘preceding realities and significations.’ And despite my deliberately narrow focus on a single set of relays that connect linear models, the logistic function, the cost function and gradient ascent, there are hundreds and perhaps and hundreds of thousands of ‘points of emergence’ associated with this diagram of functioning.</p>
<p>The machine learning diagram, like any functioning, harbours the potential for invention. Describing the application of machine learning to biomedical and clinical research, James Malley, Karen Malley and Sinisa Pajevic contrast it to more conventional statistical knowledges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>working with statistical learning machines can push us to think about novel structures and functions in our data. This awareness is often counterintuitive, and familiar methods such as simple correlations, or slightly more evolved partial correlations, are often not sufficient to pin down these deeper connections. <span class="citation">[@Malley_2011, 5-6]</span>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Novel structures and functions in ‘our data’ are precisely the functions that machine learning technique seek to learn. Could new habits or actively diverging worlds that Stengers calls for appear amidst this quasi-iterative pursuit of optimisation and convergence? This is a terrain for critical thought to explore. A function in isolation never learns. But when watched or observed, even virtually, divergence has some chance. To the extent that machine learners relay references experimentally between things and people, mobilising the production of statements and visibilities across different elements, divergence remain possible.</p>


<p>In the final pages of <em>The Taming of Chance</em>, Ian Hacking describes the work of the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in terms of a twin affirmation of chance. First, Peirce, following the work of the psychophysicist Gustav Fechner and before him the astronomer-sociologist Adolphe Quetelet, re-enacts the normal curve.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> The ‘personal equation,’ the variation in measurements made by any observer, becomes ‘a reality underneath the phenomena of consciousness’ <span class="citation">[@Hacking_1990, 205]</span>.  Peirce’s belief in absolute chance or a stochastic ontology,  ‘a universe of chance’ as Hacking puts it, continued a series of ‘realizations’ of curves, in which astronomical, social, biological and finally psychological variations were all understood as generated by processes of chance. Second, and in order to show the underlying reality of the normal curve, ‘Peirce deliberately used the properties of chance devices to introduce a new level of control into his experimentation. Control not by getting rid of chance fluctuations, but by adding some more’ <span class="citation">[@Hacking_1990, 205]</span>. In the century or so since, what happened to the thorough-going affirmation of statistical thought and probabilistic practice epitomised by Peirce?  Hacking stresses that he does not understand Peirce as the precursor or the innovator of twentieth century statistical thought (Hacking’s <em>Taming of Chance</em> ends at 1900), but rather as ‘the first philosopher to conceptually internalize the way chance had been tamed in the nineteenth century’ (215). What would the equivalent philosopher-machine learner internalize today? What would such persons, working in science or media or government, hold firm in relation to chance, probability and statistics? </p>
<p>In the opening lines of the preface to the First Edition of <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em>, Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman describe the altered situation of statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The field of Statistics is constantly challenged by the problems that science and industry brings to its door. In the early days, these problems often came from agricultural and industrial experiments and were relatively small in scope <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, xi]</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(At the end of the preface, they also cite, we might note in passing, Hacking’s work: ‘The quiet statisticians have changed our world’ <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, xii]</span>.) One of the challenges science and industry has brought to the door of statistics in recent years has not only been more data but also machine learners. What difference do the ‘vast amounts of data … generated in many fields’ (xi) make to the field of statistics? Statistics has, I will suggest in this chapter, gradually <em>probabilised</em> machine learners, or injected a substratum of chance that flows directly from their operation.  To grasp this , we need to determine what role randomness, change and the probabilistic distribution of elements and events play in machine learning. These questions of how worlds becomes thinkable through machine learning can be addressed partly by contrasting the ‘taming of chance’ achieved by eighteenth and nineteenth century statistics and the taming of data – and machines – in statistical practices of machine learning today. </p>
