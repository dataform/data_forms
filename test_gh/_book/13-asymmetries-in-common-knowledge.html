<h1><span class="header-section-number">13</span> Asymmetries in common knowledge</h1>
<p>What can critical thought, the kind of enquiry that seeks to identify the conditions that concretely constitute what anyone can say or think or do, learn from machine learning? If we see a massive regularization of order occurring in machine learning, what is at stake in trying to think through those practices? They display moments of formalisation (especially mathematical and statistical), circulation (pedagogically and operationally), generalization (propagating and proliferating in many domains and settings) and stratification (the socially, epistemically, economically and sometimes politically or ontologically loaded re-iterative enactment of categories). I am not sure that understanding how a support vector machine or a random forest orders differences would change how would we relate to what we see, feel, sense, hear or think in the face of a contemporary platform such as Amazon’s  that uses Association Rule Mining , an app, a passport control system that matches faces of arriving passengers with images in a database, a computer game, or a genetic test (all settings in which machine learning is likely to be operating).</p>
<p>Machine learners themselves sometimes complain of the monolithic and homogeneous success of machine learning. Some expert practitioners complain of a uniformity in its applications. Jeff Hammerbacher , previously chief research scientist at Facebook, co-founder of a successful data analytics company called Cloudera, and currently working also on cancer research at Mount Sinai hospital, complained about the spread of machine learning in 2011: ‘the best of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads’ <span class="citation">[@Vance_2011]</span> . Leaving aside debates about the ranking of ‘best minds’ (a highly competitive and exhaustively tested set of subject positions; see chapter ), Hammerbacher was lamenting the flourishing use of predictive analytics techniques in online platforms such as Twitter, Google and Facebook, and on websites more generally, whether they be websites that sell things or advertising space. The mathematical skills of many PhDs from MIT, Stanford or Cambridge were wrangling data in the interests of micro-targeted advertising. As Hammerbacher observers, they were ‘thinking about how to make people click ads,’ and this ‘thinking’ mainly took and does take the form of building predictive models that tailored the ads shown on websites to clusters of individual preferences and desires.</p>
<p>Hammerbacher’s unhappiness with ad-click prediction resonates with critical responses to the use of machine learning in the digital humanities.  Some versions of the digital humanities make extensive use of machine learning. To cite one example, in <em>Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History</em>, Matthew Jockers describes how he relates to one currently popular machine learning or statistical modelling technique, the topic model  (itself the topic of discussion in Chapter ; see also <span class="citation">[@Mohr_2013]</span>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the statistics are rather too complex to summarize here, I think it is fair to skip the mathematics and focus on the end results. We needn’t know how long and hard Joyce sweated over <em>Ulysses</em> to appreciate his genius, and a clear understanding of the LDA machine is not required in order to see the beauty of the result. <span class="citation">[@Jockers_2013, 124]</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The widely used Latent Dirichlet Allocation or models provide a litmus test of how relations to machine learning is taking shape in the digital humanities. On the one hand, these models promise to make sense of large accumulations of documents (scientific publications, news, literature, online communications, etc.) in terms of underlying themes or latent ‘topics.’ As we will, large document collections have long attracted the interest of machine learners (see chapter ).  On the other hand, Jockers signals the practical difficulties of relating to machine learning when he suggests that ‘it is fair to skip the mathematics’ for the sake of ‘the beauty of the result’. While some parts of the humanities and critical social research exhorts closer attention to algorithms and mathematical abstractions, other parts elides its complexity in the name of ‘the beauty of the results.’</p>
<p>Critical thought has not always endorsed the use of machine learning in digital humanities.  Alex Galloway makes two observations about the circulation of these methods in humanities scholarship. The first points to its marginal status in increasingly machine-learned media cultures:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using quantitative methodologies in the academy (spidering, sampling, surveying, parsing, and processing), one must compete broadly with the sorts of media enterprises at work in the contemporary technology sector. A cultural worker who deploys such methods is little more than a lesser Amazon or a lesser Equifax <span class="citation">[@Galloway_2014, 110]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Galloway highlights the asymmetry between humanities scholars and media enterprises or credit score agencies (Equifax). The ‘quantitative methodologies’ that he refers to as spidering, sampling, processing and so forth are more or less all epitomised in machine learning techniques (for instance, the Association Rule Mining techniques used by Amazon to recommend purchases, or perhaps the decision tree techniques  used by the credit-rating systems at Equifax and FICO <span class="citation">[@Fico_2015]</span>).  Galloway’s argument is that the infrastructural scale of these enterprises along with the sometime very large technical workforces they employ to continually develop new predictive techniques dwarfs any gain in efficacy that might accrue to humanities research in its recourse to such methods.</p>
<p>Galloway also observes that even if ‘cultural workers’ do manage to learn to machine learn, and become adept at re-purposing the techniques in the interests of analyzing culture rather than selling things or generating credit scores,they might actually reinforce power asymmetries and exacerbate the ethical and political challenges posed by machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it appropriate to deploy positivistic techniques against those self-same positivistic techniques? In a former time, such criticism would not have been valid or even necessary. Marx was writing against a system that laid no specific claims to the apparatus of knowledge production itself—even if it was fueled by a persistent and pernicious form of ideological misrecognition. Yet, today the state of affairs is entirely reversed. The new spirit of capitalism is found in brainwork, self-measurement and self-fashioning, perpetual critique and innovation, data creation and extraction. In short, doing capitalist work and doing intellectual work—of any variety, bourgeois or progressive—are more aligned today than they have ever been <span class="citation">[@Galloway_2014, 110]</span>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This perhaps is a more serious charge concerning the nature of any knowledge produced by machine learning.  The ‘techniques’ of machine learning may or may not be positivist, and indeed, given the claims that machine learning transforms the production of knowledge, positivism may not be any more stable than other conceptual abstractions.  Hence, it might not be so strongly at odds with critical thought, even if remains complicit – ‘aligned’ – with capitalist work. Intellectual work of the kind associated with machine learning is definitely at the centre of many governmental, media, business and scientific fields of operation and increasingly they anchor the operations of these fields. Yet neither observation – asymmetries in scale, alignment with a ‘positivist’ capitalist knowledge economy – exhaust the potentials of machine learning, particularly if, as many people claim, it transforms the nature of knowledge production and hence ‘brainwork.’</p>
