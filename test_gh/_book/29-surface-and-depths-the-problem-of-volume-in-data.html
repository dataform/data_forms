<h1><span class="header-section-number">29</span> Surface and depths: the problem of volume in data</h1>
<p>The local complex of activities for associating datasets shatters tables from a different direction than that described by Foucault in <em>The Order of Things</em>. Algebra, linear algebra in particular, organizes and distributes differences in vector space. <em>Mathesis</em> in the form of algebraic operations of addition and multiplication of collections of tabular elements such as rows and columns, now re-defined as vectors, re-structure tabular data as a vector space, as a ‘set’ whose membership is only limited by the applicability of the constructing relations. These operations absorb and subtend differences in quality, type, kind and quantity. </p>


<p>Of the three example datasets (<code>prostate</code>, <code>spam</code> and <code>zip</code>), <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> returns most frequently to <code>prostate.</code> This dataset derives from the work of urologists working at Stanford <span class="citation">[@Stamey_1989]</span>, and concerns various clinical measurements performed on men who were about to undergo radical prostatectomy. The measurements range across the volume and weight of the prostate, as well as levels of various prostate-related biomarkers such as PSA – prostate specific antigen. Several rows from the dataset are shown in Table . The first pages of the book had already exhaustively plotted all the variables in the dataset against each other using the table-related form of a scatter plot matrix <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009,3]</span> (shown in figure , and they return to the same data on almost a dozen occasions in the course of the book, subjecting it to repeated vectorization.  </p>
<p>The contrast between the Table  and the Figure  already depends on a transformation intrinsic to vectorization. On the one hand, the table arrays all different data types in rows and columns. In the table, the relation between the different data types (the log of the weight of prostate - <code>lwp</code> and <code>age</code> for instance) is quite hard to see. Moreover, different kinds of variables stand side by side. <code>svi</code>, short for ‘seminal vesicle invasion’ is a categorical variable.  It takes the values ‘true’ or ‘false,’ shown here as <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>, but the other variables either measure or count things (years, sizes, or levels of antigens).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the scatter plot matrix also takes the form of a grid-like figure, but the cells of the grid are not occupied by numbers but by <code>x-y</code> plots of different pairs of variables in the <code>prostate</code> dataset. The ‘matrix’ of figures shows of 72 plots is mirrored across the diagonal that runs from the top-life to bottom right in figure . Taking this folding into account, we see 36 unique plots with different data in each one. Each sub-plot displays the relation between two variables in the dataset as a scatter plot. Some variables such as <code>svi</code> are not very amenable to plotting in this way. More importantly perhaps, certain combinations of variables appear as flat loci that can be read as signs of relations between different variables. The scatter plot matrix constructs a tabular space in which relational contrasts between pairs of variables start to appear. In the light of these contrasts (and I use ‘light’ here in an almost literal sense to refer to the way in which the architecture of the figure creates a space in which light scatters in varying patterns), the <code>prostate</code> dataset begins to expose relations that might be worth knowing about. We have moved on from the bare table of the dataset to a transformed tabulation, from a textual-numerical grid to a geometrical-numerical grid. Everything remains on the surface of a grid here, but the grid permits differences in relationality to begin to appear. </p>
<p>All of this somewhat precedes the operational formation of machine learning. Similar tables and plots are part and parcel of statistical data exploration more generally (see <span class="citation">[@Beniger_1978]</span> for an historical account of quantitative graphics in statistics).  The scatterplot matrix does not exhaust differences or relationality in the <code>prostate</code> dataset, but highlights a tendency to approach it from different angles (12 times in the <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em>) in order to map the multiple relations or influences that remain opaque to even the most exhaustive matrices of plots. The scatterplot matrix shows pairs of variables in relation. If the crucial diagnostic factor in this case is an elevated level of the PSA (prostate specific antigen), how do we know what combinations of other measurements might be associated with its elevation? What if multiple variables affect the level of PSA?<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> This question can just about be pursued by scanning the matrix of plots, but not very stably since different data analysts might see different associations combining with each other there. Different statements or epistopics could be supported by the same figure. </p>
<p>The very question of relation between multiple variables and the predicted levels of PSA suggests the existence of a hidden, occluded or internal space that cannot be seen in a data table, and that cannot be brought to light even in the more complex geometry of a plot. This volume contains the locus of multiple relations, a locus inhering in a higher dimensional space, in this case, the nine dimensional space subtended by treating each of the nine variables or columns in the <code>prostate</code> dataset as occupying its own dimension. A different basis of order – the vector space –  begins to take shape when dataset variables (usually columns in a table) become dimensions.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<ol start="21">
<li id="fn21"><p>Despite the intensive work that Hastie and co-authors conduct on the <code>prostate</code> data, all with a view to better predicting PSA levels using volumes and weights of prostates, etc., Stamey and other urologists more than a decade or so concluded that PSA is not a good biomarker for prostate cancer.  Stamey writes in 2004:</p><p>What is urgently needed is a serum marker for prostate cancer that is truly proportional to the volume and grade of this ubiquitous cancer, and solid observations on who should and should not be treated which will surely require randomized trials once such a marker is available. Since there is no such marker for any other organ confined cancer, little is likely to change the current state of overdiagnosis (and over-treatment) of prostate cancer, a cancer we all get if we live long enough. <span class="citation">[@Stamey_2004, 1301]</span><a href="29-surface-and-depths-the-problem-of-volume-in-data.html#fnref21">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>Every distinct column in a table practically adds a new dimension to the vector space. Since the 1950s, problems of classification and prediction in high-dimensional spaces have been the object of mathematical interest. The mathematician Richard Bellman coined the term ‘the curse of dimensionality’ to describe how partitioning becomes more unstable as the dimensions of the space increase <span class="citation">[@Bellman_1961]</span>.  The problem is that while the volume of a space increases exponentially with dimensions, the number of data points (actual measurements or observations) usually does not usually increase at the same rate. In high dimensional spaces, the data becomes more thinly spread out. It is hard to partitions sparsely populated spaces because they accommodate many different boundaries. <a href="29-surface-and-depths-the-problem-of-volume-in-data.html#fnref22">↩</a></p></li>
