<h1><span class="header-section-number">49</span> Spam: when <span class="math inline">\(\forall{N}\)</span> is too much?</h1>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\forall{N}\)</span> can be a bother. In <em>Doing Data Science</em>, Rachel Schutt and Cathy O’Neill furnish a <code>bash</code> script (that is, command line instructions) to download the well-known<code>Enron</code> email dataset  and build a Naive Bayes classifier that labels email as spam or not. In many ways, this is canonical machine learner pedagogy. For Naive Bayes, email spam detection has become the standard example (Andrew Ng uses it in CSS229, Lecture 5 <span class="citation">[@Ng_2008]</span>).  In this setting, machine learners operate as filters coping with too much communication. </p>
<p>A typical spam email in the <code>Enron</code> dataset, a dataset that derives from the U.S Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s investigation into Enron Corporation <span class="citation">[@Klimt_2004]</span>, looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: it’s cheating, but it works ! can you guess how old she is ? the woman in this photograph looks like a happy teenager about to go to her high school prom, doesn’t she ? she’ s an international, professional model whose photographs have appeared in hundreds of ads and articles whenever a client needs a photo of an attractive, teenage girl.but guess what ? this model is not a teenager ! no, she is old enough to have a 7-year-old daughter.. she also says, &quot; if it weren’t for this amazing new cosmetic cream called ‘deception,’ i would lose hundreds of modeling assignments…because…there is no way i could pass myself off as a teenager.&quot; service dept 9420 reseda blvd # 133 northridge, ca 91324</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text of a typical non-spam email like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: industrials suggestions…… ———————-forwarded by kenneth seaman / hou / ect on 01 / 04 / 2000 12 : 47 pm————————– - pat clynes @ enron 01 / 04 / 2000 12 : 46 pm to : kenneth seaman / hou / ect @ ect, robert e lloyd / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : industrials ken and robert, the industrials should be completely transitioned to robert as of january 1, 2000.please let me know if this is not complete and what else is left to transition . thanks, pat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such communications, with their mixture of solicitation and imperative are familiar to anyone who uses email. How does Naive Bayes probablise their differences?  How do they become <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> or even <span class="math inline">\(f_j(X)\)</span> in the Naive Bayes classifier? The code that <em>Doing Data Science</em> supplies is instructive:</p>

<p><span class="citation">[@Schutt_2013, 105-106]</span></p>
<p>The script draws out something of how the joint probability function in equation () probabilises a single word.<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a>  Not all machine learning models are so simple that they can be conveyed in 30 lines of code (including downloading the data and comments),  but the script signals that nothing that occurring in probabilisation  is intrinsically mysterious, elusive or indeed particularly abstract.<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> On the contrary, the power of classifiers operates through the accumulated counting, adding, multiplying (that is, repeated adding) and dividing (that is, multiplying by parts or fractions) constrained by the joint probability distribution. Probability re-distributes things such as emails or documents as, in this case, events in a population of words. The Naive Bayes classifies endows every word in the <code>Enron</code> dataset with a probability density function. The classification of each email becomes a matter of estimating a conditional probability based on the joint probability distribution that quantifies the chance of all the words in that email appearing together. Probabilities are always between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, and classification entails selected a cutoff or dividing line. For instance, greater than <code>0.5</code> might result in a classification as <code>spam</code>. In the <code>enron</code> dataset, ‘finance’ has a NaN chance of being spam, while ‘sexy’ has a chance of NaN. Ironically, like the Naive Bayes classifier’s own reliance on seventeenth and eighteenth century probability calculus, the frequent application of this machine learner to document classification and retrieval echoes the seventeenth century thinking that first conceived of the very notion of ‘probability’ in relation to the evidential weight of documents <span class="citation">[@Hacking_1975, 85]</span>. </p>

<ol start="57">
<li id="fn57"><p>The input to the script is a single word such as ‘finance’ or ‘deal’. The model is so simple that it only classifies a single word as spam. The <code>bash</code> script carries out four different transformations of the data in building the model. It uses only command line tools such as <code>wc</code> (word count), <code>bc</code> (basic calculator), <code>grep</code> (text search using pattern matching) and <code>echo</code> (display a line of text). These tools or utilities are readily available in almost any UNIX-based operating system (e.g. Linux, MacOS, etc.). The point of using only these utilities is to illustrate the simplicity of the algorithmic implementation of the model. The first part of the code downloads the sample dataset of Enron emails (and I will discuss spam emails and their role in machine learning below). Note that this dataset has already been divided into two classes - ‘spam’ and ‘ham’ – and emails of each class have been placed in separate directories or folders as individual text files.  <a href="49-spam-when-foralln-is-too-much.html#fnref57">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn58"><p>After fetching the dataset from a website, the code excerpted in  counts the number of emails in each category <code>spam</code> or <code>ham</code>, and then counts the number of times that the chosen word (e.g. ‘finance’ or ‘deal’) occurs in both the spam and non-spam or ham categories. In Part 2, using these counts the script estimates probabilities of any email being spam or ham, and then given that email is spam or ham, that the particular word occurs. (To estimate a probability means, in this case, to divide the word count for the chosen word by the count of the number of spam emails, and ditto for the ham emails.) In Part 3, the final transformation of the data, these probabilities are used to calculate the probability of any one email being spam given the presence of that word. Again, the mathematical operations here are no more complicated than adding, multiplying and dividing. The probability that the chosen word is a spam word is, for instance, the probability of occurrence of the word in a spam email multiplied by the overall probability that an email is spam. Finally, given that the probability of the chosen word occurring in the email dataset is the probability of it occurring in spam plus the probability of it occurring in ham, the overall probability that an email in the Enron data is spam given the presence of that word can be calculated. (It is the probability that the chosen word is a spam word divided by the probability of that word in general.)<a href="49-spam-when-foralln-is-too-much.html#fnref58">↩</a></p></li>
