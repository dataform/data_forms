<h1><span class="header-section-number">71</span> A privileged machine and its diagrammatic forms</h1>
<p>What accounts for the somewhat uneven fortunes of the neural net amongst machine learners? The unevenness of their performance, from limited curiosity in the late 1960s to handcrafted best-in-class performer in the machine learning image classification competitions of the 1990s, from second best competitor in late 1990s to the spectacular promise of deep belief networks amidst the ‘awesome materiality’ of social media image streams in 2012, suggests that some powerful dynamics or becomings are in play around them. These dynamics are not easily understood in terms of celebrity machine learners (human and non-human) suddenly rising to prominent or privileged positions in the research departments of social media platforms.<a href="#fn97" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> Nor does it make sense to attribute the rising fortunes of the neural net to the algorithms themselves, as if some decisive advance occurred in algorithms.</p>
<p>The algorithms such as back-propagation used in neural nets have not, as we will see, been radically transformed in their core operations since the 1980s, and even then, the algorithms themselves (principally gradient descent ) were not new. There have been important changes in scale (similar to those described in the previous chapter in the case of the <code>RF-ACE</code> algorithm and Google Compute), but as is often the case in machine learning, their proliferation occurs through re-distributions of knowledge and infrastructure associated with altered subject positions. While machine learners in their machine form can be assigned a privileged position in the transformations of knowledge and action, human machine learners are not exactly marginalized, at least in celebrated cases such as Ng, Le Cun, Hinton and others. Rather, we can see varying subject positions emerging in relation to specific devices and data forms (images, sounds, documents) in specific sites (social media platforms and mobiles devices in particular).</p>
<p>A varying subject position surfaces in the operational architecture of neural nets. Despite differences in diagrammatic form, neural net share much with other machine learners. The language of brain, neurones and cognition associated with neural net covers over their much more familiar vector space and function-finding optimisations they rely on. Diagrammatic groupings and lines of movement operate in neural nets to expand their architecture in alignment with a series of well-established transformations. ‘The central idea,’ write Hastie and co-authors, ‘is to extract linear combinations of the inputs as derived features, and then model the target as a nonlinear function of these features. The result is a powerful learning method, with widespread applications in many fields’ <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 389]</span>. The ‘central idea’ can be seen in the algebraic expressions that Hastie and co-authors provide for the basic neural net model:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Z = (Z_1 , Z_2, ..., Z_M )\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T = (T_1 , T_2 ,..., T_K )\)</span>. The activation function <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(v)\)</span> is usually chosen to be the sigmoid <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(v) = 1/(1 + e - v )\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 392]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Equation  diagrams some familiar elements as well as some novelty. Some elements of the neural net are already familiar from linear models. The neural networks transform data in a vector space denoted by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. That is common to nearly all machine learners. They make use of the non-linear sigmoid function  that lies at the heart of one of the main linear classifiers used in machine learning, logistic regression. Their training and learning processes have come to rely on the same kinds of cost, loss or error functions  we have seen in other machine learners. </p>
<p>The apparently increasing power of neural nets to learn (to see, to find, to classify, to rank, to predict) owes much to diagrammatic substitutions that recombine operations of past machine learners in new intersections. These movements appear in the equations. Equation  has three lines rather than one, and this layering and its diagonal patterns of indexical referencing running between subscripts distinguishes neural nets from the linear models it assembles. </p>

<p>Whereas the standard linear model  shown in Equation  indexes a single vector space <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span> and approximates it using a single function <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> by searching for the values of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> that best incline a flat plane through the data, the three lines shown in equation  are woven through each other much more consecutively. Each lines derives ‘features’ from the line above, adding layers to the network. So-called ‘hidden layers,’ such as line two of equation  repeatedly transform the vector space inside the model itself. Each node, <span class="math inline">\(1..K\)</span>, adds a new dimension to this internal vector space. In many layered deep learning neural nets, the dimensionality of the vector space vastly expands.  Much hinges on the unobstrusive sigmoid function operator written as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>: ‘a neural network can be thought of as a nonlinear generalization of the linear model, both for regression and classification. By introducing the nonlinear transformation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, it greatly enlarges the class of linear models’ <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 394]</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, it seems, allows neural nets to generalize beyond the linear model.<a href="#fn98" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
