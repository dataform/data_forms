<h1><span class="header-section-number">19</span> Who reads machine learning textbooks?</h1>
<p>How does such textbook help us assess and engage with claim to learn from data or to produce knowledge differently? While it certainly does not comprehend everything taking place in and around machine learning, it diagrams several <em>elementary</em> tendencies or traits.  It’s readership as we will see is widespread. It has a heterogeneous texture in terms of the examples, formalisms, disciplines and domains it covers. It starkly renders the problems of making sense of mathematical operations, diagrams and transformations carried on through calculation, simulation, deduction or analysis. It draws on a matrix of operational practices, particularly in the form of the <code>R</code> code it heavily but somewhat latently relies on. In short, <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> presents a multi-faceted and somewhat monumental layering of abstractive practice that might be open to archaeological inquiry.</p>

<p>Who reads the <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em>?  It is often cited by academic machine learning practitioners as an authoritative guide. On the other hand, students participating in new data science courses often come from different disciplinary backgrounds and find the tome unhelpful (see the comment by students during an introductory data science course documented in <span class="citation">[@Schutt_2013]</span>). Whether the citations are friendly or not, it is hard to find a field of contemporary science, engineering, natural, applied, health and indeed social science that has not cited it. A Thomson-Reuters Scientific ‘Web of Science’(TM) search for references citing either the first or second edition of <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009]</span> yields around 9000 results. These publications sprawl across over 100 different fields of research.  While computer science, mathematics and statistics dominate, a very diverse set of references comes from disciplines from archaeology, through fisheries and forestry, genetics, robotics, telecommunications and toxicology ripple out from this book since 2001. Table  shows the top 20 fields by count. One could learn something about the diagrammatic movement of machine learners from that reference list, which itself spans biomedical, engineering, telecommunications, ecology, operations research and many other fields. While it is not surprising to see computer science, mathematics and engineering appearing at highest concentration in the literature, molecular biology, control and automation, operation research, business and public health soon appear, suggesting something of the propagating accumulation or positivity of machine learning. </p>

<p>So we know that <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> passes into many fields. But what do people read in the textual environment of book? In general, the thousands of citations of the book themselves compose a diagram of the book’s intersection with different domains of knowledge. The relative concentrations and sparsities of these citations suggest there may be specific sites of engagement in the techniques, approaches and machines that the book documents. Of the around 760 pages in the two editions (<span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009]</span> and <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2001]</span>), around 83 distinct pages are referenced in the citing literature. As figure  indicates, certain portions of the book are much more heavily cited than others. This distribution of page references in the literature that cites <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> is a rough guide to how the book has been read in different settings. For instance, the most commonly cited page in the book is page 553. That page begins a section called ‘Non-negative Matrix Factorization’,  a technique frequently used to process digital images to compress their visual complexity into a simpler set of visual signals <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 553]</span>. (The underlying reference here is the highly cited paper <span class="citation">[@Lee_1999]</span>) Like <code>kittydar</code>, it, as Hastie and co-authors write, ‘learns to represent faces with a set of basis images resembling parts of faces’ <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 555]</span>. (So <code>kittydar</code>, which doesn’t use NMF, might do better if it did, because it could work just with parts of the images that lie somewhere near the parts of a cat’s face – its nose, its eyes, its ears.) </p>
<p>Conversely, what do the authors of <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> read? The book gathers elements from many different quarters and seeks to integrate them in terms of statistical theory. The hyperobject-like aspect of the book comes from the thick weave of equations, diagrams, tables, algorithms, bibliographic apparatus, and numbers wreathed in typographic ornaments drawn from many other sources. For instance, in terms of outgoing references or the literature that it cites, <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> webs together a field of scientific and technical work with data and predictive models ranging across half a century. The reference list beginning at page 699 <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 699]</span> runs for around 35 pages, and the five hundred or so references there point in many directions. The weave of these elements differs greatly from citational patterns in the humanities or social sciences. Reading this book almost necessitates an archaeological approach since it comprises so many parts and fragments. </p>

<p>The citational fabric of <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> is woven with different threads, some reaching back into early twentieth statistics, some from post-WW2 cybernetics, many from information theory and then in the 1980s onwards, increasingly, from cognitive science and computer science (see figure  to get some sense of their distribution over time). While some of these references either point to Hastie, Tibshirani or Friedman’s own publications, or that of their statistical colleagues, the references rove quite widely in other fields and over time. <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> as a text is processing, assimilating and recombining techniques, diagrams and data from many different places and times. (The different waves appearing in the references cited in <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009]</span> will shape discussion in later chapters in certain ways; for instance, late 1990s biology is the topic of chapter  and optimization functions dating from the 1950s are discussed in chapter ).</p>
<p>Both the inward and outward movements of citation suggest that <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em>, like much in field of machine learning, has a matrix-like character that constantly superimposes and transposes elements across boundaries and barriers. The implication here is that machine learning as a knowledge practice has a highly interwoven texture, and in this respect differs somewhat from the classical understandings of scientific disciplines as bounded by communities of practice, norms and problems (as for instance, in Thomas Kuhn’s account of normal science <span class="citation">[@Kuhn_1996]</span>.  This aggregate or superimposed character of machine learning should definitely figure in any sense we make of it, and will inevitably affect how critical thought might test itself against it. .</p>
