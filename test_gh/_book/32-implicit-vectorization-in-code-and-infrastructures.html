<h1><span class="header-section-number">32</span> Implicit vectorization in code and infrastructures</h1>
<p>Vectorised transformations of data lie are the moving substrate of machine learning as it expands, but they are largely taken for granted as given space or commonsense ground. <code>R</code> coding practice instantiates vectorization in multiple ways, and is sometimes described as a ‘vectorised programming language.’ The vector space  appears and operates just as directly in other programming languages designed for data practice (Octave, Matlab, Python’s NumPy, or C++ Armadillo).</p>
<p>In vectorised languages such as <code>R</code>, transformations of a data structure expressed in one line of code simultaneously affect all the elements of the data structure. As the widely used <em>R Cookbook</em> puts it, ‘many functions [in <code>R</code>] operate on entire vectors … and return a vector result’ <span class="citation">[@Teetor_2011, 38]</span>. Or as <em>The Art of <code>R</code> Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design</em> by Norman Matloff puts it, ‘the fundamental data type in <code>R</code> is the <em>vector</em>’ <span class="citation">[@Matloff_2011, 24]</span>, and indeed in <code>R</code>, all data is vector. There are no individual data types, only varieties of vectors in <code>R</code>.  There are many vectorised operations in the <code>R</code> core language and many to be found in packages (the popular ‘plyr’ package; vectorised operations can also be found in recent Python data analysis libraries such as <code>numpy</code> or <code>pandas</code> <span class="citation">[@McKinney_2012]</span>).  The fact that many of these vectorised operations occur implicitly suggests how pervasive vector space has become in data practice.<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<pre><code> [1]  0  2  4  6  8 10 NA 16 18 20</code></pre>
<pre><code> [1]  0  2  4  6  8 10 12 16 18 20</code></pre>
<p>The practical difference between the two approaches to moving through data is illustrated in the code listing  in which two ‘vectors’ of numbers are added together, in the first case using a classic <code>for</code>-loop construct, and in the second case using an implicitly vectorised arithmetic operation <code>+</code>. The difference between adding <span class="math inline">\(1 ... 10\)</span> using a loop or vector arithmetic is completely trivial here, or as we will soon see, nested operations are involved, these differences in coding significantly affect human-machine relations.  This simultaneity is only apparent, since somehow the underlying code has to deal with all the individual elements, but vectorised programming languages take advantage of hardware optimisations or carefully-crafted low-level linear algebra libraries.<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> More importantly, this is a different mode of movement. Operations now longer step through a series of coordinates that address data elements, but wield planes, diagonals, cross-sections and whole-space transformations. Vectorized code reduces both data and computational frictions. The real stake in vectorizing data is not speed but transformation. It makes working with data less like iteration through data structures (lists, indexes, arrays, fields, dictionaries, variables), and more like folding a pliable material. Such practical shifts in feeling for data are mundane yet crucial to the epistopic movements in data.  <a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>Vectorization also motivates increasingly parallel contemporary chip architectures, clusters of computers such as <code>hadoop</code> or <code>spark</code>, reallocation of computation to GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit),  data-centre usage of FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays)  and various other Cyclopean infrastructures of cloud computing.  Many of these condensing and expanding movements of data are diagrammed in miniature in the <code>R</code> constructs as operators in vector space.</p>

<ol start="29">
<li id="fn29"><p><code>R</code> sometimes presents difficulties for programmers trained to code using so-called procedural programming languages because it so thoroughly embraces the notion of the <em>vector</em> – and hence, regards all data as inhabiting vector space. In many mainstream programming languages, transformations of data rely on loops and array constructs in which some operation is successively repeated on each element of a data structure. <a href="32-implicit-vectorization-in-code-and-infrastructures.html#fnref29">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>Learning machine learning, and learning to implement machine learning techniques, is largely a matter of implementing series of matrix multiplications. As Andrew Ng advises his students,</p><blockquote><p>Almost any programming language you use will have great linear algebra libraries. And they will be high optimised to do that matrix-matrix multiplication very efficiently including taking advantage of any parallelism your computer. So that you can very efficiently make lots of predictions of lots of hypotheses <span class="citation">[@Ng_2008a, 10:50]</span></p></blockquote><p>In other parts of his teaching, and indeed throughout the practice exercises and assignments, Ng stresses the value of implementing machine learning techniques for both understanding them and using them properly. But this is one case where implementation does not facilitate learning. Ng advises his learners against implementing their own matrix handling code. They should instead use the ‘great linear algebra libraries’ found in ‘almost any programming language.’ ‘linear algebra libraries’ multiply, transpose, decompose, invert and generally transform matrices and vectors.  they will be ‘highly optimised’ not because every programming language has been prepared for the advent of machine learning on a large scale, but rather more likely because matrix operations are just so widely used in image and audio processing. Happily, Ng observes, that means that ‘you can make lots of predictions’ <span class="citation">[@Ng_2008e]</span>. It seems that generating predictions and hypotheses outweighs the value of understanding how things work on this point. <a href="32-implicit-vectorization-in-code-and-infrastructures.html#fnref30">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>A further level of vectorization appears in specific <code>R</code> constructs such as <code>apply</code>, <code>sapply</code>, <code>tapply</code>, <code>lapply</code>, and <code>mapply</code>.  All of the <code>-ply</code> constructs have a common feature: they take some collection of things (it may be ordered in many different ways – as a list, as a table, as an array, etc.), do something to it, and return a collection. While most programming languages in common use offer constructs to help deal with collections of things sequentially (for instance, by accessing each element of a list in turn and doing something with it), <code>R</code> offers ways of expressing a simultaneous operation on them all. The <code>-ply</code> constructs ultimately derive from the functional logic developed by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s <span class="citation">[@Church_1936;@Church_1996]</span>.  The functional programming style of applying functions to functions seems strangely abstract. <a href="32-implicit-vectorization-in-code-and-infrastructures.html#fnref31">↩</a></p></li>
