<h1><span class="header-section-number">56</span> Limiting differences</h1>
<p>Given this problem of unstable difference, much of the development of decision tree did not revolve around how to construct them, but how to limit their growth so as to manage tensions between pure but unstable differences and impure but stable classification. As <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> puts the problem in its account of classification and regression trees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How large should we grow the tree? Clearly a very large tree might overfit the data, while a small tree might not capture the important structure. Tree size is a tuning parameter governing the model’s complexity, and the optimal tree size should be adaptively chosen from the data. One approach would be to split tree nodes only if the decrease in sum-of-squares due to the split exceeds some threshold. This strategy is too short-sighted, however, since a seemingly worthless split might lead to a very good split below it. The preferred strategy is to grow a large tree <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>, stopping the splitting process only when some minimum node size (say 5) is reached. Then this large tree is pruned using cost-complexity pruning <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 307-308]</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing a maximum decision tree, and then cutting back its branches using a cost-function  optimises the decision tree as a machine learner.   ‘Cost complexity pruning’ extends the optimisation we have already discussed in relation to linear regression and logistic regression models (in chapter ). As in these techniques, the definition of a cost function controlling the ‘complexity’ of a tree – how many branches and leaves/nodes it contains, combined with measures of how well it classifies or predicts – iteratively observes and tests different versions of tree against each other. ‘We define the cost complexity criterion,’ write Hastie and co-authors, as:</p>

<p>The idea is ‘to find, for each <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the subtree <span class="math inline">\(T_\alpha \subseteq T_0\)</span> to minimize <span class="math inline">\(C_\alpha(T)\)</span>’ <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 308]</span>. For present purposes, we need only recognise that the cost complexity function re-configures a large decision tree (<span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> in equation ) by cutting or pruning it back through optimisation that balances between the complexity of the tree and its stability. Tree construction is as an optimisation problem, in which the variation of a parameter (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) allows minimization of a derived value (the cost <span class="math inline">\(C_\alpha\)</span>). </p>
<p>While the graphic form of the decision tree was, by virtue of the long-standing diagrammatic practice of tree-drawing, easy to interpret, observation of decision trees had no way of gauging the instability or variability of any given tree.  Hastie and co-authors write: ’one major problem with trees is their high variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. The major reason for this instability is the hierarchical nature of the process: the effect of an error in the top split is propagated down to all of the splits below it <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 312]</span>. The very diagrammatic form that allows decision trees to be observed and interpreted is also the source of their instability. Regardless of this instability, the diagrammatic composition of the tree through splitting and pruning negotiates between two different ways of doing difference.</p>
<p>The shift from <code>AID</code> to <code>CART</code> enunciates a change in how patterns of difference become visible. The decision tree algorithm superimposes recursive partitioning and cost-complexity pruning to configure a mode of enunciation of differences. It creates a new rules of differentiation of individuals, facts, things and relations.[^5.101] Differences in a decision tree – the combination of purity and density that comes from recursive partitioning and cost-complexity pruning – re-configure what counts as pattern. </p>
<p>Decision trees have been heavily used in credit risk assessment as well as many biomedical models. Does their popularity stem from the legibility of the statements they produce, even if those patterns prove unstable? Or is the success of the decision tree perhaps better understood as a change in the differentiation of patterns more generally, their mode of enunciation, in which case, decision trees would only be one instance among many?  If we understand machine learners as generating populations of statements, the transformation and re-modelling of the decision tree as classification and regression trees suggests a subtle, non-localizable discontinuity. The later development of the decision tree and its subsequent transmogrification into random forests <span class="citation">[@Breiman_2001]</span>,  that grow a myriad of small decision trees disperses kaleidoscopic fragments of classificatory order with only partial or provisional stabilisation in visible pattern. In such developments – and we could also consider here techniques, models and methods of ‘boosting,’ ‘bagging,’ or the ‘ensemble learning’ that conducts ‘supervised search in a high-dimensional space of weak learners’ <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 603]</span>, pattern has an operational rather than visible mode of togetherness. </p>
