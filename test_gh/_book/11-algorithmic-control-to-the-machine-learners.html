<h1><span class="header-section-number">11</span> Algorithmic control to the machine learners?</h1>
<p>Written in code, machine learners operate as programs or computational processes to produce statements that may take the form of numbers, graphs, propositions (see for instance the propositions produced by a recurrent neural net on the text of this book in the concluding chapter ). Machine learning can also be viewed as a change in how programs or the code that controls computer operations are developed and operate (see chapter  for more detailed discussion of this).  The term ‘learning’ in machine learning points to this change and many machine learners emphasize it. Pedro Domingos, for instance, a computer scientist at the University of Washington, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning algorithms – also known as learners – are algorithms that make other algorithms. With machine learning, computers write their own programs, so we don’t have to.<span class="citation">[@Domingos_2015a, 6]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viewed from the perspective of control, and how control is practiced, digital computer programs stem from and epitomise the ‘control revolution’ <span class="citation">[@Beniger_1986]</span> that arguably has, since the late nineteenth century, programmatically re-configured production, distribution, consumption, and bureaucracy by tabulating, calculating and increasingly communicating events and operations. With the growth of digital communication networks in the form of the internet, the late 20th century entered a new crisis of control, no longer centred on logistic acceleration but on communication and knowledge.  Almost all accounts of the operational power of machine learning emphasise its power to inflect the control of processes of communication – border flows, credit fraud, spam email, financial market prices, cancer diagnosis, targeted online adverts – processes whose unruly or transient multiplicity otherwise evades or overwhelm us – with knowledge (classifications and predictions in particular) derived from algorithms that make other algorithms. On this view, <code>kittydar</code> can isolate cats amidst the excessive accumulation of images on the internet because neural net learning algorithms (back-propagation, gradient descent) have written a program – ‘a pre-trained’ neural net – during its training phase. </p>
<p>If a newly programmatic field of knowledge-control takes shape around machine learning, how would we distinguish it from computation more generally? Recent critical research on algorithms offers one lead. In a study of border control systems, which often use machine learners to do profiling and facial recognition , Louise Amoore advocates attention to calculation and algorithms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surely this must be a primary task for critical enquiry – to uncover and probe the moments that come together in the making of a calculation that will automate all future decisions. To be clear, I am not proposing some form of humanist project of proper ethical judgement, but rather calling for attention to be paid to the specific temporalities and norms of algorithmic techniques that rule out, render invisible, other potential futures <span class="citation">[@Amoore_2011]</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Amoore writes, some potential futures are being ‘ruled out’ as calculations automate decisions. Anna Munster  puts the challenge more bluntly: ‘prediction takes down potential’ <span class="citation">[@Munster_2013]</span>. I find much to agree with here. Machine learning is a convoluted but nevertheless concrete and historically specific form of calculation  (as we will see in exploring algebraic operations in chapter , in finding and optimising certain mathematical functions in chapter  or in characterising and shaping probability distributions in chapter ). It works to mediate future-oriented decisions (although all too often, very near-future decisions such as ad-click prediction).</p>
<p>I am less certain about treating machine learning as automation. Learning from data, as we will see, does often sidestep and substitute for existing ways of acting, and practices of control, and it thereby re-configures human-machine differences.  Yet the notion of automation does not capture well how this comes about.  The programs that machine learner ‘write’ are formulated as probabilistic models, as learned rules or association, and they generate predictive and classificatory statements (‘this is a cat’). They render calculable some things which hitherto appeared intractable to calculation (for instance, the argument of a legal case). Such calculation, with all the investment it attracts (in the form of professional lives, in the form of infrastructures , in reorganisation of institutions, corporations and governments, etc.) does rule out some and reinforce other futures. <a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> If this transformed calculability is automation, we need to understand the specific contemporary reality of automation as it takes shape in machine learning. We cannot conduct critical enquiry into the calculation that will automate future decisions without opening the very notions of calculation and automation into question. </p>
<p>Does the concept of algorithm help us identify the moments that come together in machine learning without resorting to a-historical concepts of automation or calculation? In various scholarly and political debates around changes business, media, education, health, government or science, quasi-omnipotent agency has been imputed to algorithms  <span class="citation">[@Barocas_2013; @Beer_2013; @Cheney-Lippold_2011; @Fuller_2012; @Galloway_2004]</span>; <span class="citation">@Gillespie_2014</span>; <span class="citation">@Neyland_2015</span>; <span class="citation">@Pasquinelli_2014</span>; <span class="citation">@Smith_2013</span>; <span class="citation">@Totaro_2014</span>; <span class="citation">@Wilf_2013</span>] or sometimes just ‘the algorithm.’ This growing body of work understands the power of algorithms in the social science and humanities literature in different ways, sometimes in terms of rules, sometimes as functions or mathematical abstractions, and increasingly as a located practice. There is general agreement that algorithms are powerful, or at least, can bear down heavily on people’s lives and conduct, re-configuring, for instance, culture as algorithmic <span class="citation">[@Hallinan_2014]</span>.</p>
<p>Some of the critical literature on algorithms identifies abstractions as the source of their power. For instance, in his discussion of the ‘metadata society,’ Paolo Pasquinelli proposes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a progressive political agenda for the present is about moving at the same level of abstraction as the algorithm in order to make the patterns of new social compositions and subjectivities emerge. We have to produce new revolutionary institutions out of data and algorithms. If the abnormal returns into politics as a mathematical object, it will have to find its strategy of resistance and organisation, in the upcoming century, in a mathematical way <span class="citation">[@Pasquinelli_2015]</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Moving at the same level of abstraction as the algorithm’ offers some purchase as a formulation for critical practice, and for experiments in such practice. Since in mathematics let alone critical thought, abstraction can be understood in many different ways, any direct identification of algorithms with abstraction will, however, be difficult to practice. Which algorithm, what kind of abstraction and which ‘mathematical way’ should we focus on? Like automation and calculation, abstraction and mathematics have mutable historicities.  We cannot ‘move at the same level’ without taking that into account. Furthermore, given the accumulations of settings, data and devices, there might not be any single level of abstraction to move at, only a torque and flux of different moments of abstraction at work in generalizing, classifying, circulating and stratifying in the midst of transient and plural multiplicities. </p>

Postal service clerks no longer sort the mail because neural net-based handwriting recognition reads addresses on envelopes . Locomotives, cars and trucks are already driven by machine learners, and soon driving may not be same occupational cultural it was. Hundreds of occupational categories have to some degree or other machine learners in their near future.
