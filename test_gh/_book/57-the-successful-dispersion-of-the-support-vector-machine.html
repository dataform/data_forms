<h1><span class="header-section-number">57</span> The successful dispersion of the support vector machine</h1>
<p>In growing and pruning decision trees, and even more markedly in support vector machine, patterns play out in dispersion and discontinuity rather than in regular geometry.  While machine learners order differences, that ordering becomes increasingly difficult to see as it is dispersed. Take the case of the support vector machine. The second most highly cited reference in the last few decades of machine learning literature is a paper from 1995 by Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik of AT &amp; T Bell Labs in New Jersey, USA entitled ‘Support Vector Networks’ <span class="citation">[@Cortes_1995]</span>. Few women’s names appear prominently in the machine learning literature.    The computing science and statistics departments at Stanford and Berkeley, the laboratories at Los Alamos and AT&amp;T Bell between the 1960s and the 1980s were, it seems, not overly popular or populated with women scientists and engineers. Some prominent machine learning researchers at the time of writing are women (I return to this in chapter ), but Cortes is perhaps pre-eminent both as head of Google Research in New York (2014) and as recipient with Vapnik of an Association for Computing Machine award in 2008 for work on the support vector machine algorithm.<a href="#fn72" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a>   </p>

<p>The rapid rise to popularity of the support vector machine can be seen in the machine learning research literature, a very small slice of which appears in Table . A substantial fraction of the overall research publication since the mid-1990s accumulates around this single technique, and as usual ranges across credit analysis, land cover prediction, protein structures, brain states and face recognition. The support vector machine spans the normal biopolitical triangle of life, labour and language. The influence of the technique can also be seen in overlapping fields such as pattern recognition and data mining, where <span class="citation">[@Cortes_1995]</span> and similar papers rank near the top-cited papers.<a href="#fn73" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a> This kind of growth betokens high levels of interest, identification and investment on the part of the researchers, and presumably more widely.</p>

<p>I suggested above that the classification tree (and then random forests) illustrate an enunciative modality anchored in a tension between recursively partitioned differences and classificatory stability.  The support vector machine shown in Figure  demonstrates a different change in what counts as pattern. The decision boundaries in the sub-graphs have different contours, contours that suggest a more mobile construction. While the name ‘support vector machine’ is somewhat forbiddingly technical compared to more familiar terms such as ‘decision tree’ or even ‘neural network,’ the underlying intuition of the technique is much older, and can be found in the models developed by the British statistician R. A. Fisher during the 1930s. Fisher developed the ‘first pattern recognition algorithm’ <span class="citation">[@Cortes_1995, 273]</span>, the ‘linear discriminator function’ <span class="citation">[@Fisher_1936]</span>, to deal with problems of classification, and demonstrated its efficacy on the taxonomic problem of discriminating or classifying the irises observed in W.E. Anderson’s irises in <code>iris</code> dataset (see above).   </p>
<p>In his 1936 article in the <em>Annual Review of Eugenics</em>, Fisher comments on similar classification work carried out in craniometry and other related settings: so-called ‘discriminant functions’ had been successfully used to distinguish populations. Fisher wrote: ‘when two or more populations have been measured in several characters, … special interest attaches to certain linear functions of measurements by which the populations are best discriminated’ <span class="citation">[@Fisher_1936, 179]</span>.  The discriminant functions divide the vector space into ‘a collection of regions labeled according to classification’ <span class="citation">[@Hastie_2009, 101]</span>. ‘Decision boundaries’ (or sometimes ‘decision surfaces’  often appear as straight lines that divide the vector space into regions of constant classification.  These long-standing discriminant functions were reconstructed during the 1990s in the form of the support vector machine, giving rise to new statements about differences, statements that can be glimpsed in table  in the range of things, facts and beings running through the titles of the papers.</p>

<li id="fn72"><p>The support vector machine is distinctive in its transformations of data, and this owes something to history, politics and geography. Vapnik trained and worked of decades in the former USSR as a mathematician and statistician. His writings on the problems of pattern recognition contrast greatly with other engineers, statisticians and computer scientists in their robustly theoretical formalism. A highly cited 1971 publication with Alexey Chervonenkis ‘On the uniform convergence of relative frequencies of events to their probabilities’ (published in Russian in 1968 ) <span class="citation">[@Vapnik_1971]</span> sets the formal tone of this work. In ensuing publications in Russian and then in English after Vapnik moved from Moscow to AT&amp;T’s New Jersey Bell Labs in 1990, Vapnik’s work remains quite formally mathematical. Although it pertains to ‘learning machines,’ machine here are understood mathematically simply as ‘the implementation of a set of functions’ <span class="citation">[@Vapnik_1999, 17]</span>.  The way that Vapnik develops a theory of learning owes little visible debt to actual attempts to work with data or experience in doing statistics in any particular domain. This contrasts greatly for instance with the work of statisticians like Breiman or Friedman or even computer scientists like Quinlan or Le Cun whose work lies much closer to fields of application. Vapnik’s work, like that of the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov he draws on, differs from many other contributions to machine learning partly by virtue of this formality and its efforts to derive insight into machine learning by theorising learning. The <em>Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension</em>( VC dimension), a very widely used way of defining the capacity of a particular machine learning technique to recognise patterns in data dates from his work in the 1960s and underpins a general theory of ‘learning.’ Vapnik writes in 1995, </p><blockquote><p>The VC dimension of the set of functions (rather than the number of parameters) is responsible for the generalization ability of learning machines. This opens remarkable opportunities to overcome the “curse of dimensionality <span class="citation">[@Vapnik_1999, 83]</span>.</p></blockquote><p>As we will see in this chapter, Vapnik’s attempts to overcome dimensionality also re-shape what counts as pattern. <a href="57-the-successful-dispersion-of-the-support-vector-machine.html#fnref72">↩</a></p></li>
