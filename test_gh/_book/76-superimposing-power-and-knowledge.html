<h1><span class="header-section-number">76</span> Superimposing power and knowledge</h1>
<p>It would be possible to explore in much greater ethnographic depth the practices of Kaggle competitors, the spectrum of participants (ranging from undergraduate student teams through to retired scientists, from hedge fund financial analysts to physicists), and the ways in which the topics of competitions relate to different scientific, governmental and commercial problems. Here I am interested mainly in the form of the competition as a test or examination centred on errors. The competitions take the form of examinations that set a problem, define some limits or constraints on its solution, and create a space that qualifies, ranks and displays the work of individuals or groups according to rates of generalization error (the error that arises when a machine learner encounters new data). </p>
<p>Machine learning competitions instance practices of examination that Foucault described in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The examination combines the techniques of an observing hierarchy and those of a normalizing judgement. … It establishes over individuals a visibility through which one differentiates them and judges them. That is why, in all the mechanisms of discipline, the examination is highly ritualized. In it are combined the ceremony of power and the form of the experiment, the deployment of force and the establishment of truth. At the heart of the procedures of discipline, it manifests the subjection of those who are perceived as objects and the objectification of those who are subjected. The superimposition of the power relations and knowledge relations assumes in the examination all its visible brilliance <span class="citation">[@Foucault_1977, 183-185]</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The disciplinary form of the examination of errors links statements and operations. Examinations combine ceremony, ritual, experiment, force and truth in subject and object positioning operations.  The consolidation of machine learning as a data practice today in competitions occurs via a much more pervasive practice of examining and testing. The forms of visibility created by competitions individualize and normalize machine learners (often by proper names), and optimise extractions of force, time, propensities and aptitudes.</p>

<p>In many Kaggle competitions (some titles are shown in table ), winning entries come from machine learners working together.  In the National Data Science Bowl competition of 2015, competitors were asked to classify images of more than 100 species of plankton. The winning team comprised seven graduate and post-doctoral researchers from Ghent University, Belgium. In a jointly written blog account of their winning entry, team ‘Deep Sea’ describe something of the construction of the deep learning models they built. These were convolutional neural nets, neural nets in which elements of the network only ‘look’ at overlapping tiles of the input images: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We started with a fairly shallow models by modern standards (~ 6 layers) and gradually added more layers when we noticed it improved performance (it usually did). Near the end of the competition, we were training models with up to 16 layers. The challenge, as always, was balancing improved performance with increased overfitting <span class="citation">[@Dieleman_2015a]</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like many of the entrants in image-based classification competitions such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge <span class="citation">[@ILSVRC_2014]</span>, ‘Deep Sea’ built their machine learner in several stages, first deriving features  from the data by creating various layers that looked for common features across various scales, rotations and other transformations of the plankton images, and then adding neural net layers to classify those derived features using the labels supplied in the training set. In this respect, and in almost perfect synchrony with the deep learning teams at Google, Facebook and many other places, ‘Deep Sea’ combined supervised and unsupervised learning techniques . The lower convolutional layers that process the images are strictly speaker unsupervised because they make no use of the known labels or categories of the plankton; the upper layers are supervised because they make use of the labels in the normal back-propagation process of neural net training.</p>
<p>In comparison to the plain or ‘vanilla’ neural nets discussed above, deep belief networks involve many more parameters, stages of observation and modelling, configuration of hardware and infrastructural arrangements and comparison of results. ‘Deep Sea’ describe the architecture of one of their more successful models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has 13 layers with parameters (10 convolutional, 3 fully connected) and 4 spatial pooling layers. The input shape is (32, 1, 95, 95), in bc01 order (batch size, number of channels, height, width). The output shape is (32, 121). For a given input, the network outputs 121 probabilities that sum to 1, one for each class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to describe the different layers – cyclic slice, convolutional, spatial pooling – that derive features from the data or augmenting it (by examining overlapping tiles, by rotating or scaling the images, so that any given image, is ‘seen’ in a number of different ways, and the model learns to detect these variations). The combination of diverse layers in a stratified model introduces a range of learners into the operation, just as Kaggle itself networks many machine learners through its competitions.</p>
<p>A massive parallel computation allows ‘deep’ learning. Infrastructure and cognition entwine heavily here, since the very possibility of training large many-layered neural nets depends heavily on vectorised transformations of image data. Probably few other competitors in this competition would have had access to the Tesla K40 or ‘NVIDIA GTX 980 Superclocked’ GPU cards that ‘Deep Sea’ relied on.<a href="#fn102" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a>  Even with that intensive computational resource, their models required ‘between 24 and 48 hours to reach convergence.’ They constructed around 300 models. Because of the plethora of models with different architectures and parameters, ‘we had to select how many and which models to use in the final blend’ <span class="citation">[@Dieleman_2015a]</span>. As is often the case, competition engenders populations of machine learners whose aggregate tendencies model optimum performance.<a href="#fn103" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The ‘DeepSea’ team might epitomise machine learning subject positions. Like the ‘wonderful people’ described by Hilary Mason, they bring together infrastructure, engineering, mathematics/statistics and some knowledge of human behaviour (although the knowledge of human behaviour in this case might have more to do with what other Kaggle competitors might be doing, as well as an awareness of cutting edge research leaders in image recognition techniques).</p>

<li id="fn102"><p>As another competitor in the National Data Science Bowl mentions:</p><blockquote><p>One example is here the Kaggle plankton detection competition. At first I thought about entering the competition as I might have a huge advantage through my 4 GPU system. I reasoned I might be able to train a very large convolutional net in a very short time – one thing that others cannot do because they lack the hardware <span class="citation">[@Dettmers_2015]</span></p></blockquote><p>Hardware parallelism and vectorization, at least in the area of deep learning, seems to matter more than the ability to test, examine, observe or invest new model configurations. <a href="76-superimposing-power-and-knowledge.html#fnref102">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn103"><p>On the command line, <code>git clone https://github.com/benanne/kaggle-ndsb</code> makes a copy of the model code.
