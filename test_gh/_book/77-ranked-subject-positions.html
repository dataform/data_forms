<h1><span class="header-section-number">77</span> Ranked subject positions</h1>
<p>‘DeepSea’ built models that classify images of more than a hundred kinds of plankton with few errors. In driving down error rates more than the hundreds of other competitors, they occupy a privileged subject position at the conjunction of operation and the statements in machine learning. Machine learners such as deep belief nets adjust and align subject positions through their many convolutional layers. They supplant, for instance, the skilled configuration of feature engineering  that characterised work on decision trees, linear regressions, support vector machines and predecessor neural nets (and appears as a key element in figure ). Similarly, they absorb the professional skills of Go players in training models that win against the best human players <span class="citation">[@Silver_2016]</span>.  The subject position of a machine learner occupies a zone of diagrammatic slippage between statements and operations. </p>
<p>The various subject positions that might speak of, observe, question or decide about machine learning are neither unified or fixed. As the models grow, for instance, they test the capacity of human machine learners to understand how models transform data. Perhaps more profoundly, the growth of neural nets exhibits the deeply competitive imperative that imbues much machine learning practice, and in many way machine learning practice. This competition is not always explicit or overt, but it almost transpires in the form of a test or examination.</p>
<p>Neural nets re-iteratively draw human-machine learning differences. Their own ups and downs, the merging and blending of statistics, computer science and cognitive science they afford, and their potential to drive down error or learn features  from data given enough data derives less from some exotic mathematical abstraction or encompassing algorithm, and more from competitively accumulated layers and connections between units of modelling. The oscillating movement of the central algorithm – feed-forward and back-propagation – is instructive. Because it propagates errors to all elements of the network, and every element in the network adjusts its weights in trying to minimise error, layers can multiply on many scales.  The predictive power of the model derives from the networked collective of elementary machine learners driven to optimise their error rates. So too, the competitive examinations that today generalize machine learning as a data practice predicate the ongoing potential of hidden layers – machine learners – to collectively learn from their rankings in tests of error.</p>
<p>As it disperses subject positions, the back-propagation of errors or optimisation also animates optimism about machine learning.<a href="#fn104" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a>  Machine learning hovers in potentiality because neural nets and their kin assimilate and adjust their weights in response to changes in infrastructures and in the generalization of operations to newly adjacent domains. Machine learners generate optimism through and about optimisation, an optimisation that is predictive, prospective and anticipatory. But this adjusting of weights carried out through the propagation of errors is also inherently a ranking or examination. </p>
<p>Human and machine learner differences can be re-drawn in two different directions. In one direction, machine learning operations assign a subject position focused on error rates. Vlad in his corner observing the neural nets occupied such a position.  In the other direction, the subjects who operate the neural net in order to fit a model find themselves deeply caught up in a network of machine learners connected into parallel and layered architectures and operations. This feeding-forward, however, is regularized or narrowed down through examination and error, through back-propagation on various scales that ranks and filters machine learners according to their error rates. In this direction, the practice of training and testing generalization error that has long guided the supervision of machine learners becomes a mechanisms for adjusting subject positions of human machine learners. Some will be wonderful people, some will remain remote like Vlad, and some will optimistically re-learn in order to change their ranking. </p>

<li id="fn104"><p>The cultural theorist Lauren Berlant describes optimism as an ‘operation’:</p><blockquote><p>The surrender to the return to the scene where the object hovers in its potentialities is the operation of optimism as an affective form <span class="citation">[@Berlant_2007, 20]</span></p></blockquote><p>Berlant’s complicated formulation brings together surrender, return, scene, object, potentialities and affective form. These movements, places and things might be understood as purely psychic or semiotic processes. But optimism as an asignifying diagrammatic operation also plays out across the manifold surfaces of algorithms, datasets, models, platforms and ranking systems associated with machine learning as a competitive examination. <a href="77-ranked-subject-positions.html#fnref104">↩</a></p></li>
