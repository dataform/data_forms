<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Obstacles to the work of freeing machine learning</h1>
<p>As I have emphasised on several occasions, machine learning is an uneasy mixture of massively repeated and familiar forms, and something that is not easily understood. On the one hand, the level of imitation, duplications, copying and reproduction associated with the techniques suggests that a process of remaking the world according to particular forms is in process (for instance, in chapter  we saw how Naive Bayes classifiers are almost demonstrated on spam classification problems.) The scientific and engineering literature, with its really frequent variations on similar themes, suggests that imitation and copying are very much at the heart of the movements I have been describing. This is nothing new.  It would be strange of these techniques were not subject to imitation and emulation. That imitation is predictable. We expect it and can account for it sociologically.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some symptoms of these imitative fluxes can be found in the scientific and engineering literature. As we have seen, work on image and video classification, on text and speech, on gene interaction prediction or above all, on predictions of relations or associations between people and things (usually commodities, but not always) is striking in its persevering homogeneity. Moreover, the powerful aspirations evident amongst large media platforms such as Baidu, Google and Facebook to re-ground machine learning in the project of artificial intelligence amidst social media or web page-related data in many ways continues business as usual for computer scientists <span class="citation">[@Gulcehre_2014]</span>.</p>
<p>How would we get any sense of what is not so easily digested and laid out in social practice? Archaeologies of operational formations aim to present some of the necessary elements for that purpose. In the closing pages of <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>, Foucault writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the positivities that I have tried to establish must not be understood as a set of determinations imposed from the outside on the thought of individuals, or inhabiting it from the inside, in advance as it were; they constitute rather the set of conditions in accordance with which a practice is exercised, in accordance with which that practices gives rise to partially or totally new statements, and in accordance with which it can be modified. These positivities are no so much limitations imposed on the initiative of subjects as the field in which that initiative is articulated <span class="citation">[@Foucault_1972, 208-209]</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Foucault refers to the restricted freedom that discursive practices and formations open for us. If it is increasingly difficult for science, media, government and business to think and act outside data. And yet Foucault is quite clear that amidst the positivities of knowledge production, knowing the conditions, setting out the rules, and identifying the relations that striate the density and complexity of practice is a pre-condition to any transformations in practice.</p>
<p>As a data practice, however, machine learning is not entirely predictable. Machine learners, as we have seen, vary too much, they are biased, they overfit, they underfit, and they often fail to generalise.  Despite this, they have enormous allure. In the history of automata, automation and animation, kinetic lures have long exercised fascination, and this may be part of the effect of machine learning. Animating transformations of data (think of the 366 times the logistic regression traverses the <code>South African Heart Disease</code> dataset), and then looking at those optimising animations as ‘learning’ generates operational power dynamics. </p>
<p>Machine learning more broadly attracts infrastructural, technical, professional, semiotic and financial diagonals – think of the upswing in Google searches for ‘machine learning’ shown in figure  in chapter  – that render its traits more real, more thickly transformative and more ‘performant.’ Yet such performant diagrams generate referential effects. Machine learning becomes ontologically potent. As Maurizio Lazzarato writes in <em>Signs and Machines</em>, ‘ontological mutations are always machinic. They are never the simple result of the actions or choices of the “man” who, leaving the assemblage, removes himself from the non-human, technical, or incorporeal elements that constitute him’ <span class="citation">[@Lazzarato_2014, 83]</span>. </p>
<p>New machine learners arise from diagrammatic superimposition of existing practices or procedures. Neural networks are like a massively proliferating nest of perceptrons. Moreover, machine learning techniques often repeat something familiar by very different means (think of how <code>kittydar</code> treats photographs, or how a decision tree is legible but often unfamiliar). The event, then, resides less in either something intrinsic to devices operating as algorithmic models, or in something about the domains and places in which the devices operate (biomedicine, state security and intelligence agencies, finance, business, commerce, science, etc.). Perhaps it is a rather more modest event in which the tending of abstractions through estimation, optimisation, high-dimensional vectorisation, probabilistic mixing of latent and feature variables, and imputation unevenly replace existing ontological and epistemic norms of verification, objectification, and attribution. </p>
<p>I have been less interested in treating these techniques as the predictable re-animation of alienated reason, and more inclined to look for those elements in machine learning that diagrammatically abstract away from structures of representations, subjectification or indeed implementation associated with platforms, services and products (for instance, the interminable implementations of document classifiers, sentiment analyses, or image labelling, or handwritten digit recognition, or autonomous navigation, etc.).</p>
