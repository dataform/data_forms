# Machines finding functions

'Machines finding functions': there is a triple word play in the title of this chapter. From an _almost_ purely technical standpoint, machine learning can be understood as function finding, that is, finding a mathematical expression that approximates to the process that generated the data in question. The second sense of that title is that machine learning offers a plethora of techniques, and much machine learning work, at least for many practitioners, concerns not so implementation of particular techniques (neural network, decision tree, support vector machine, logistic regression, etc.), but rather navigating the maze of methods and variations that might be relevant to a particular situation. The variety of functions affects any learning of machine learning. The third sense of the title is less technical, and concerns something more dynamically transcontextual. That is, how machine learning itself has itself come to operate as a powerful diagram for infrastructural, operational, financial, scientific, governmental and marketing processes. Here, the machines -- the classifiers and the predictive models -- have found functions as they have been inserted into infrastructures, experiments, and organisations.
