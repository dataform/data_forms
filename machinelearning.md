\begin {equation}
\label {eq:logistic_regression}
Pr(G=K|X=x) = \frac{1}{1+\sum_{l=1}^{K-1}exp(\beta_{l0} + \beta_l^Tx)} 
\end {equation}

\begin {equation}
\label {eq:linear_model}
\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta_0}  + \sum^p_{j=1} X_j \hat{\beta_j}
\end {equation}

On the flight over, an equation, like Haraway's equation for Terrapolis @GRMFXMB2#Haraway_2016. It's a very general expression, a way of writing what machine learning does, or how it learns from data by fitting a function to it. I can't seen to stop flying at a high level, way above the ground. Love of technicalities is not a good propensity for sts researchers since they can easily be caught up in it.

'What about regulation?' is the question after a public lecture on what is happening with machine learning. I'm flippant, even dismissive in response. I think I say regulation is beside the point.  I avoid the question, perhaps because all around the me the fact-value split is taking hold of discussion about it.   
I'm scripted by it. Machine learning has delegated something to me, perhaps one of its contradictions: become a machine learner and think about it at the same time. It's a classic ANT-case in reverse. The artefactual is scripting the factual.  It's a sobering thought. I'm working as part of the propagation of the function finding. I'm help find a function.  
In the office, my laptop fan is making too much noise because its trying to build a model of a platform
I try to model the distribution of activities of a few tens of million people and a few million projects. On a laptop.
all around me, machine learning is ramping up
My proposition? that we might include something more through ml? and that the practices itself might become more observable, common because of that?
I like what I find in the propagation of machine learning. It's inclusion of so many things in the world: ecosystems, media platforms, patterns of infection, etc. Its as if there is a quasi-common ground, a space for composition of collectives, something different to the familiar institutions. Perhaps not.
All around the fact-value split is washing at my sandcastle's walls. The ATI, bastioned in the British Library, people started to flock to it, machine learners, ethicists, philosophers, policy-makers and social scientists.  


Struggling with a massive literature
Coping with millions of repositories
Drowning in streams of social media, twitter, youtube and news announcements
Surrounded by funding calls and projects, especially a mushrooming of data science and machine learning projects; including many in universities as well as Google, etc.

# Getting it wrong in practice

I never make it to the Copenhagen Machine Learning Meetups, not once during several months in Copenhagen in 2014. The meetups, usually early evening,  clash with my non-research commitments, like taking kids to the park after school.  An evening meetup at the offices of King!, the makers of Kandy Krush Saga, a particularly juicy instance of algorithmic absorption, is on my calendar. But I don't go.  

It is possible that my frustrations at missing fieldwork, of building an ethnographic archive of experience on which I can draw, are trivial. And the desire to be in a field, to have a  field site, to somehow ground research in peoples and their practicing, to move away from my desk and screen, to cycle along the lovely streets, waterfronts and urban conviviality of the city, to meet the intelligent, good-humoured Danish machine learners, is strong.  There is a countervailing desire, strongly felt, in the way that a toothache might be, acting this whole time. It shadows my every analytical move, vexing my attempts to find something redeeming in machine learning.
