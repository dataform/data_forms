# General ideas

Struggling with a massive literature
Coping with millions of repositories
Drowning in streams of social media, twitter, youtube and news announcements
Surrounded by funding calls and projects, especially a mushrooming of data science and machine learning projects; including many in universities as well as Google, etc.

# Getting it wrong in practice

I never make it to the Copenhagen Machine Learning Meetups, not once during several months in Copenhagen in 2014. The meetups, usually early evening,  clash with my non-research commitments, like taking kids to the park after school.  An evening meetup at the offices of King!, the makers of Kandy Krush Saga, a particularly juicy instance of algorithmic absorption, is on my calendar. But I don't go.  

It is possible that my frustrations at missing fieldwork, of building an ethnographic archive of experience on which I can draw, are trivial. And the desire to be in a field, to have a  field site, to somehow ground research in peoples and their practicing, to move away from my desk and screen, to cycle along the lovely streets, waterfronts and urban conviviality of the city, to meet the intelligent, good-humoured Danish machine learners, is strong.  There is a countervailing desire, strongly felt, in the way that a toothache might be, acting this whole time. It shadows my every analytical move, vexing my attempts to find something redeeming in machine learning.
