Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press.\n{Rabinow, 2003 #23}\n\nEvents problematize classifications, practices, things. The problematization of classifications, practices, things is an event. A sensibility of constant change, and a certain pleasure and obligation to grasp it and participate in the transformations, constitute one mode of relating to things. This sensibility takes the mode of a keen awareness that the taken-for-granted can change, that new entities appear, that our practices of making are closely linked to those entities, that we name them, that we group them, that we experiment with them,  that we discover different contours when deploying questions and techniques. 67\n\nHow to think about things human is a problem. Most attempts to solve this problem deploy one or another answer that claims to offer generality and stability. These attempts have produced incompatible answers. The fact that there is a problem in thinking about human things, and that part of that problem lies in the inability to produce a stable solution, is coexistent and cotemporal with the practice itself. 4\nA problematization, then, is both a kind of general historical and social situation-saturated with power relations, as are all situations, and imbued with the relational “play of truth and falsehood,” a diacritic marking a subclass of situations-as well as a nexus of responses to that situation. (19)\nApparatuses are the forms composed of heterogeneous elements that have been stabilized and set to work in multiple domains. 55",

In this multiplication of relations, topological change is established as being constant, normal and immanent, rather than being an exceptional form, which is externally produced; that is, forms of economic, political and cultural life are identified and made legible in terms of their capacities for continuous change. Outlining the contributions to this Special Issue, the introduction discusses the meaning of topological culture and provides an analytic framework through which to understand its implications.},\n	number = {4-5},\n	urldate = {2012-12-05},\n	journal = {Theory, Culture \\& Society},\n	author = {Lury, Celia and Parisi, Luciana and Terranova, Tiziana},\n	year = {2012},\n	keywords = {change, comparison, continuity, models, networks, topological culture},\n	pages = {3--35}\n},\n\n@article{lakhani_prize-based_2013,\n	title = {Prize-based contests can provide solutions to computational biology problems},\n	volume = {31},\n	copyright = {© 2013 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The article reviews the different evocations of descriptive sociology pronounced by three very different contemporary sociologists: Andrew Abbott, John Goldthorpe, and Bruno Latour, and lays out their different approaches to the role of the `sociological descriptive'. It is argued that their apparent differences need to be placed in a broader re-orientation of sociology away from its historical interface with the humanities and towards the natural sciences. How this reorientation involves a new role for visual methods which have traditionally been decried in orthodox sociology is examined, and the article concludes with suggestions for how sociology might best orient itself to the descriptive turn.},\n	number = {1},\n	urldate = {2009-11-25},\n	journal = {European Journal of Social Theory},\n	author = {Savage, Mike},\n	month = feb,\n	year = {2009},\n	pages = {155--174}\n},\n\n\n@article{king_ensuring_2011,\n	title = {Ensuring the Data-Rich Future of the Social Sciences},\n	volume = {331},\n	lccn = {0004},\n	url = {http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/719.abstract},\n	doi = {10.1126/science.1197872},\n	abstract = {Massive increases in the availability of informative social science data are making dramatic progress possible in analyzing, understanding, and addressing many major societal problems.

I devote particular attention to the proofs and arguments of Minsky and Papert, which were interpreted as showing that further progress in neural nets was not possible, and that this approach to {AI} had to be abandoned. I maintain that this official interpretation of the debate was a result of the emergence, institutionalization and (importantly) legitimation of the symbolic {AI} approach (with its resource allocation system and authority structure). At the `research-area' level, there was considerable interpretative flexibility. This interpretative flexibility was further demonstrated by the revival of neural nets in the late 1980s, and subsequent rewriting of the official history of the debate.},\n	language = {en},\n	number = {3},\n	urldate = {2013-06-17},\n	journal = {Social Studies of Science},\n	author = {Olazaran, Mikel},\n	month = jan,\n	year = {1996},\n	pages = {611--659},\n	file = {Snapshot:/home/mackenza/.mozilla/firefox/w5dcspnj.default/zotero/storage/U5C4XRIM/611.html:text/html}\n}, \n\n\n@article{minsky_perceptron:_1969,\n	title = {Perceptron: an introduction to computational geometry},\n	volume = {19},\n	shorttitle = {Perceptron},\n	journal = {The {MIT} Press, Cambridge, expanded edition},\n	author = {Minsky, Marvin and Papert, Seymour},\n	year = {1969},\n	pages = {88}\n},\n\n\n@misc{dahl_deep_2012,\n	title = {Deep Learning How I Did It: Merck 1st place interview},\n	shorttitle = {Deep Learning How I Did It},\n	url = {http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/11/01/deep-learning-how-i-did-it-merck-1st-place-interview/},\n	abstract = {What was your background prior to entering this challenge?
