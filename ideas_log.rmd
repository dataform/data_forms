- looking at O'Reilly AI conference (http://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-deep-learning-bots-ny/public/schedule/grid/public/2016-09-26?view=list)[http://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-deep-learning-bots-ny/public/schedule/grid/public/2016-09-26?view=list] -- has a major list of how ai is being operationalised as part of infrastructure. Could go through this  and analyse what is happening .. downloaded the days programs ast data/2016-09-26?view=list and data/2016-09-27?view=list
- range of concerns covered here -- from platform to work, from democraticisation to human culture, etc. are symptomatic ... 
- also companies like https://backchannel.com/you-too-can-become-a-machine-learning-rock-star-no-phd-necessary-107a1624d96b#.55l4nloxi will be part of this: Bonsai, a bit like OpenAI, and PredictionIO, and PredictionAPI, ...

- I'm still interested in Kaggle competitions -- could perhaps learn a lot from looking at the differences between those more closely. e.g. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection could be worth a look

- imagenet is a really obvious candidate to talk about the implications of my argument https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/

- still also have the idea of the model of machine learning and how it might include all the subjects, enunciations, operations and functions in as weighted variables, etc. -- this might be a figure that helps communicate with machine learners.

- didn't realise that anomaly and outlier detection mainly use machine learning; another possible area to write about; cf what that paper by Tobias Blanke and Aradau discusses in Paris

- Zuberi on statistics and the construction of race: how is that being re-done today in machine learning?

- xgboost as a classic data science library -- would be useful to track its growth on  Github and the like

```{r xgb}
library(xgboost)
# load data
data(agaricus.train, package = 'xgboost')
data(agaricus.test, package = 'xgboost')
train <- agaricus.train
test <- agaricus.test
# fit model
bst <- xgboost(data = train$data, label = train$label, max_depth = 2, eta = 1, nrounds = 2,
               nthread = 2, objective = "binary:logistic")
importance  <- xgb.importance(feature_names = colnames(train), model=bst)
xgb.plot.importance(importance_matrix = importance)
# predict
pred <- predict(bst, test$data)
plot(pred)
help.start()
```

- meeting with Jenny Davis about the grandchallenge thing;
- added the document as grandchallenge_proposal.pdf
- looking at people in ANU computing on machine learning -- Bob Williamson, Lexing Xie, and Sylvie Thiebaux https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~thiebaux  and Marcus Hutter, universal artificial intelligence
