- looking at O'Reilly AI conference (http://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-deep-learning-bots-ny/public/schedule/grid/public/2016-09-26?view=list)[http://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-deep-learning-bots-ny/public/schedule/grid/public/2016-09-26?view=list] -- has a major list of how ai is being operationalised as part of infrastructure. Could go through this  and analyse what is happening .. downloaded the days programs ast data/2016-09-26?view=list and data/2016-09-27?view=list
- range of concerns covered here -- from platform to work, from democraticisation to human culture, etc. are symptomatic ... 
- also companies like https://backchannel.com/you-too-can-become-a-machine-learning-rock-star-no-phd-necessary-107a1624d96b#.55l4nloxi will be part of this: Bonsai, a bit like OpenAI, and PredictionIO, and PredictionAPI, ...

- I'm still interested in Kaggle competitions -- could perhaps learn a lot from looking at the differences between those more closely. e.g. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection could be worth a look

- still also have the idea of the model of machine learning and how it might include all the subjects, enunciations, operations and functions in as weighted variables, etc. -- this might be a figure that helps communicate with machine learners.
